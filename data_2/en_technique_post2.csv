"This work is an example of a Marken Island sampler. Samplers from this area are characterized by bands of colorful patterns. Girls stitched these bands to practice patterns for ""vernaaide linten,"" ribbons that were attached to a cap and which were an important part of the costume tradition on Marken Island. These ribbons consisted of black embroidery on white linen. The women of Marken are said to have kept their samplers in or near their kitchens for handy reference, so much of the needlework appears darkened from residue from cooking fires. Samplers from this area, including this one, often include striped horses. Spot motifs, bands of geometric patterns, and bands of cutwork and whitework are also stitched. The letters L, S, P, I, M, and N, stitched individually, in pairs, and in groups in a seemingly random fashion on the bottom of the linen are perhaps the initials of the maker and her family members.",embroidery

"While there is a long tradition of exceptional professional embroidery in England, domestic needlework attained a high point in the seventeenth century, when it was a requisite skill of accomplished young women. In addition to clothing and accessories, mirror frames, writing boxes, table covers, and pictures were decorated with embroidery. Prints served as sources for figures, flowers, and animals, which were drawn onto the fabric and given to the embroideresses. Frequently depicted themes include Old Testament stories, political subjects, allegories, and scenes of daily life. Musical Garden Party presents activities at a country house. In a formal garden, ladies perform for an appreciative male audience. By using fine-gauge canvas and silk threads, the embroideress was able to capture many fashion details such as feathered hats, lace trimming, and the floral pattern of a gown. Facial features, however, are left unembroidered. The hovering putto with bow and arrow hints at impending romance.",embroidery
"This embroidered cover probably served to decorate a small table, cabinet or other piece of furniture. The repeating border design of deep scallops is also seen on embroidered clothing and patterns for white linen lace, as well as furnishing textiles like this cover. The embroidery is executed in two colors of metal-wrapped thread: silver and gold (which was made of gilded silver), and the motifs include flowers common to English gardens of the period: irises, lilies, pansies and pomegranate fruits flanked by peacocks, with a caterpillar appearing on every third repeat of the design.",embroidery
"This roundel, together with three others in the Lehman Collection (1975.1.1906, 1975.1.1907, and 1975.1.1909), and two in The Cloisters Collection (47.101.63 and 47.101.64), form part of the same series of early fifteenth-century Franco-Flemish embroideries depicting scenes from the life of Saint Martin. Originally part of a much larger ensemble (thirty-six roundels and panels are now dispersed among public and private collections), the embroideries may have decorated a liturgical vestment, an altar frontal, or possibly a combination thereof, constituting a set of vestments. Having left the Roman army, Martin devoted himself to religious life and became a disciple of Saint Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers in France. Saint Martin is portrayed kneeling before the Bishop, who is ordaining him as acolyte. This series of embroideries, if not originally intended for a liturgical garment, may have embellished an altar frontal, similar to the blue covering that appears here on the altar behind the kneeling figure of Martin. The upper portion of the altar, adorned by a Crucifixion scene, may have been conceived as a painted or embroidered altar covering.",embroidery
"Under a microscope, warps, wefts, and the pile of this velvet exhibit a smoothness and shine typical of cultivated silk. They were all well de-gummed, removing the sericin (gelatinous protein), which allowed dyes to penetrate the fibers, especially so in the case of the cleanest, most separated pile.",velvet
"During the early fifteenth century, European velvet design was largely characterized by the use of voided patterns formed where the pile was absent.  In the second half of the century, technical innovations led to the production of increasingly complex velvets in which the richness of design and texture were achieved through the use of different heights of cut pile and of supplementary metal threads.  In this example, the broad meandering vine and the stylized foliage are woven in metal-wrapped thread with some details in raised loops to give even greater tactile effect.",velvet
"An example of the kind of work [Catherine de Medici] appreciated is the Museum's panel of yellow satin embroidered with silk threads. One of a set of three (the others are in the Musée Historique des Tissus, Lyon), it hung as a valence around the top of a four-poster bed. Various print sources were culled for the airy design of grotesques, while its five vignettes derived from Ovid's Metamorphoses- based on the myths of Europa, Actaeon, Semele, Pyramus, and Salmacis- are adapted from woodcut illustrations published by Bernard Salomon in Lyon in 1557. Its brilliant colors, exquisite design, and sumptuous material would have suited the queen's taste perfectly.",embroidery
"Band samplers comprise neatly worked rows of patterns suitable for repeating motifs or figural motifs on the long narrow strip of linen canvas. This is the most common type of extant seventeenth-century sampler, and its standard format was established by about 1630. The foundation was generally cut from one complete width of plain-weave linen, so that the selvages are present at what becomes the top and bottom of the finished work, and the sides are hemmed. Polychrome band samplers are typical, although some band samplers combined rows of whitework, cutwork, and needle lace with the polychrome patterns (see MMA, 57.122.368). A band sampler such as this would have most likely been a task completed by a schoolgirl under the supervision of an embroidery instructor of some kind. In fact, a band sampler was usually the first piece worked by a budding embroiderer beginning at about age seven or eight. The complete embroidered works by Martha Edlin, the only extant group of a young girl’s educational work, now housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum, begins with a band sampler as her earliest accomplishment.This example, signed by Anna Bucket, introduces the band sampler into the realm of the decorative by adding an image of a courting couple at the top of the sampler. With its precise date and the name of the maker placed prominently, above the cupid who hovers between the couple, the maker may have been referring explicitly to her actual or hoped-for marriage. The couple is accompanied by a dog, symbol of fidelity in marriage, and surrounded by the heraldic unicorn and lion. The image is a miniature version of the numerous pictures of courting couples in which the man and woman stand on variegated green and yellow grass; in addition to the animals, the scene is embellished with fruiting trees, flowers, and insects completely out of scale to their human companions. This type of sampler may have been displayed in the home, as became common practice in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Contemporary evidence of this practice can be found in the criminal proceedings of the Old Bailey: in December of 1750 a man was convicted for stealing, among other things, ""one needle-work sampler, with a frame and glass.""

"The Palace of St. Cloud belongs to the Duke of Orleans, is situated on the declivity of a mountain washed by the Seine. . . . The view from the house is delightful.— Harry Peckham, A Tour through Holland . . .and Part of FranceLouis XVI purchased the country residence of the duc d’Orléans a few miles west of Paris for Marie-Antoinette in 1785. Being in need of renovation, the palace was enlarged and altered for the queen, and many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené. A member of an important dynasty of Parisian chairmakers, Sené had been appointed menuisier to the Crown in 1784.A detailed 1788 description of this set, which also included four matching armchairs and a stool, indicates that the pieces were intended for one of Marie-Antoinette’s private rooms at Saint-Cloud, her Cabinet Particulier. The frame of the daybed, originally longer but shortened at a later date, is embellished with carving of ivy on the seat rail and garlands of roses along the crest rail. Ionic capitals surmount the short legs, and most remarkable of all are the Egyptian female half-figures on tapering supports that decorate the front stiles. Even though in his bill Sené called them simply caryatids, these figures clearly express the queen’s taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art, well before Napoléon’s North African campaign made it fashionable. Similar ornament is found on the bergère (a comfortable armchair upholstered between the arms and the seat ), which, in addition, has a medallion on top with Marie-Antoinette’s initials framed by myrtle branches and roses. The matching screen, however, displays classical female figures on its feet and top rail. Unfortunately, the identity of the sculptor is not known, but Louis-François Chatard is documented as having painted and gilded the wooden surfaces.The 1789 inventory of Saint-Cloud records the entire suite in the queen’s Cabinet de Toilette, or dressing room. Listed by its show covers, as was customary for seat furniture, the set is described as being upholstered in white cotton twill, embroidered with a small floral ornament in silk. Known to have worked on needlepoint projects all her life, Marie-Antoinette did the embroidery herself, which she executed in satin stitch. Modern replicas of the queen’s handiwork, including her interlaced monogram on the panel of the fire screen, grace the frames of the furniture today. The colorful floral embroidery on the light cotton ground conveys a sense of summer, the season Marie-Antoinette preferred to spend at Saint-Cloud.Epigraph. Peckham 1788, p. 199.",embroidery
"This fragment of ""opus anglicanum"" (""English work,"" as it was called in medieval inventories) is remarkable for the richness of its design and its superb state of preservation. The decoration consists of two cherubim, each atop a wheel from which rays of light emanate; four fleurs-de-lis; and four thistles in three different designs, each motif distributed along a vertical axis. These elements, all embroidered in vibrantly colored silk and silver-gilt threads, are appliquéd onto the red velvet foundation, on which the scrolls and other designs—accented with attached minute silver-gilt rings or shot—are embroidered directly. The lay of the velvet, the vertical warp and design, and the outline of the fragment indicate that it formed the lower-right quadrant of a chasuble, worn by a priest during the celebration of Mass.Please note that this object is seen on a rotating basis, due to conservation requirements.",embroidery
"Epirus was an important textile production center in the Balkans. Commercial embroidery made there in great volume for distribution throughout much of the Ottoman empire represents a mainland tradition. But Epirus was also the source of domestic embroideries that are similar to Aegean work. This bolster cover from Epirus is closely related to Greek island embroideries. Featuring three groups of horsemen and attendants amid small-scale birds, animals, vases of flowers, and double-arched structures, the cover was part of the furnishings for a bed or sofa.",embroidery
"This large rectangular textile with Chinese motifs and embroidery techniques is part of an important but little understood group of related works made in China for export.¹ Described by various scholars as hangings, covers, or coverlets, all the textiles in the group share a common layout with a central roundel in a rectangular field, surrounded by multiple borders. This type of composition is often associated with the influence of Portuguese and Spanish models, although there are some earlier Asian examples that employ this format as well.² Wholly Asian in subject and style, however, are the motifs. The pair of phoenixes at the center of the textile encircle a large peony. Similar dynamically posed birds are also seen in an architectural stone relief excavated from the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) capital and now in the National Museum of China, Beijing, as well as in a corresponding textile in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum,³ and peonies often figure in Ming rank badges, in which a pair of birds encircle a flower. Within the rectangular field are flowers and four more birds -- two golden pheasants and two peacocks, which were used as insignia for the second and third civil ranks in both Ming and Qing China. The multiple borders surrounding the central field include a wide border embroidered with various animals—rare creatures such as a tiger and elephant in addition to the familiar horse, deer, and goat, all of which are depicted side by side with such distinctively mythical Chinese beasts as a blue qilin and a white, singlehorned xiezhi. A composite animal with hooves and usually a single horn, the qilin is mentioned in poetry as early as the Han dynasty (206 b.c.–a.d. 220),⁴ its appearance was sometimes said to signal the birth of a sage, and it was used as a rank insignia for nobles. The xiezhi also appears in Han dynasty texts; known for its ability to distinguish virtue from evil, it used its sharp teeth and single horn to bite and gore wrongdoers, and it was the insignia for the censorate, which included judges. Here, both animals have flames shooting off their bodies, indicating their supernatural powers. Embroideries of this type were made for export, and a number have been preserved in Japan and Europe in historical contexts. The oldest documented example is an altar cloth in Saikyo￣ ji, a temple in Kyoto; it was donated in 1616.⁵ Another example, now in the Museo Diocesano, Chiavari, Italy, was donated to a church in Chiavari in 1651 and used as a baldachin, or canopy, for the clergy.⁶  Others are preserved in museum collections.⁷Chinese textiles and other goods came to the Americas via the Manila galleons’ annual trips between Acapulco (and Callao, the port city of Lima) and the Philippines. While to date no preserved embroideries from this group have been found in Mexico or Peru, their influence was present there by the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century,⁸ as evident in the similar layout and motifs of a Peruvian tapestry in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 33).⁹[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1.

"This miniature portrait of Charles I is one of the most technically accomplished examples of professional seventeenth-century needlework. In addition to this miniature, other examples include: two in the Victoria and Albert Museum, one in the Wallace Collection in London, one in Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, and one in the collection of John H. Bryan, which is housed in a silver-gilt frame engraved with the royal armorial and date of Charles’s execution, 30 January 1648 (old calendar). Like a painting in silk thread, this miniature represents the merging of two English artistic traditions—a naturalistic rendering of faces using fine techniques such as split stitch, which had been in use in England since the twelfth century, and the painted miniature portrait, a courtly fashion that began during the reign of Henry VIII.The king’s likeness has been taken with great fidelity from a 1641 etching by Wenceslaus Hollar, which was itself ultimately derived from a chain of different prints based on a painted portrait by Anthony van Dyck of Charles I and his consort, Henrietta Maria, painted in 1632. Oliver Millar has noted that van Dyck’s painting is in itself a reworking of the original composition by Daniel Mytens of ca. 1630-32, in the Royal Collection, Hampton Court Palace.The embroidery is contained within a glazed silver frame with molded edges and a suspension loop at the top, flanked on either side by a spiral ribbon cresting. The glass has beveled edges, and its various imperfections and minute air bubbles suggest that it is original to the period. An example of what Daphne Foskett calls a ""cabinet miniature,"" it was intended to be mounted in a cabinet or placed on a table.The bust of Charles is slightly raised from the flat gray-green satin background, an effect produced by the portrait’s having been stitched on satin. The king’s characteristic hairstyle, pointed beard, and upturned moustache are convincingly shaded in various tones of brown, brown-red, and light blond threads. Strands of hair are worked directly on the satin, with the raised portion skillfully merged into the background. The cheeks and jawline are also enhanced by shadowy tones that suggest both stubble and facial bone structure. Each thread is worked in a virtuoso technique that varies the stitch length, tension, and twist in such a way as to manipulate the play of light over the silk fibers. The intensity of detail can be grasped in a number of passages, such as Charles’s right eye, which is created from an amalgam of minute stitches. One can see under magnification that the lower lid is outlined by a minute pink thread, couched down, and worked over by a mass of flesh-toned silk. The iris is laid down in several shades of blue thread, separated from the black pupil by a lighter couching thread, which not only suggests depth by pulling the other threads around the pupil, but also creates the catch-light that defines Charles’s expression.The extraordinarily developed detail of this and the other, similar miniature portraits of the king led at one time to their being dated to the later eighteenth century, when interest in the cult of the martyred king was still strong. J.L. Nevinson, however, demonstrated the use of such techniques in other works that can be firmly placed in the period between 1650 and the end of the seventeenth century, including an embroidered bookbinding with a detailed portrait of a youth now in the Houghton Library at Harvard University that contains a copy of Hopkins’s Psalms dated 1648. It is likely then that the miniature was produced in the second half of the seventeenth century, either before or, as Nevinson posited, in the years immediately following the Restoration and is thus part of the imagery associated with the cult of the Royal Martyr.The link with the cult of Charles the Martyr is made explicit by the embroidered inscription, a quotation from Psalm 18, which associates Charles directly with the Old Testament patriarch King David: ""Deus meus est Rvpis mea Psa: 18."" The reference is to Psalm 18:2–3, which invokes God’s protection against his enemies: ""The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies."" Although the connection between contemporary monarchs and King David was a commonplace one, the specific association made here, of Charles I with the Psalms of King David, assumed a central importance in his posthumous cult. It drew from that most popular of all commemorative works, the literary ""self-portrait"" of the martyred king, the Eikon Basilike, a book notionally containing Charles Stuart’s own apologia for his life and reign, which, with its inclusion of the king’s favorite prayers and psalms, offered a kind of spiritual autobiography. Both the prayers and the meditations of the Eikon Basilike explicitly echo the Psalms of David. Indeed, the embroidered image is taken directly from a print that serves as the frontispiece of the Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae of 1651, an expanded edition of the king’s works with a bound-in 1649 version of the Eikon Basilike. As Elizabeth Wheeler has shown, the ""repeated evocation of the Psalms, the emphasis on conscience, the insistence on the depth and sorrow of his sufferings"" found in this work all presented a figure intimately accessible to ordinary laymen and women.This intimacy was reflected in small-scale portraits like the present example and other small commemorative objects that were made in the years immediately after the king’s execution. They reflect, too, the peculiarly private aspect of mourning for the king that characterized the ten-year period before the Restoration, during which time there were few permitted outlets for public grief. As Lois Potter has suggested, this circumstance conditioned the nature of the ensuing cult of the martyred king and in particular stimulated the production of such small, intimate kinds of memorial art. The inclusion of the scriptural inscription explicitly offered up the image of the martyred king as a spiritual model. The tradition that the monarch’s own hair was worked into the image would have further emphasized the character of a relic. A number of such objects are recorded in the former collection of Percival D. Griffiths. A poem by Jeremiah Wells (1646–1679), written in reaction to an analogous small-scale portrait of Charles drawn in ink on parchment, which he saw in the library of St. John’s College, Oxford, in 1665, vividly conveys the ecstatic emotions such portraits could summon up. In the latter portrait, the identification of Charles with King David is made literally indelible, for the lines of the face and hair are rendered in minute script that supposedly contain the whole Book of Psalms, or at least the Penitential Psalms. In a manuscript draft of the poem (later amended), Wells begins: ""Wash thy impure feet, and trembling trace / With wary steps this more than sacred place."" The first stanza of the published version continues in similarly hyperbolic fashion, mystically equating the king’s body with the divine word:""With double reverence we approach to lookOn what’s at once a picture and a book:Nor think it Superstition to adoreA king made now more sacred then before . . .The object here’s Majestick and divine,Divinity does Majesty enshrine . . .""A portrait of the playwright Thomas Killigrew, painted by William Shephard one year after the king’s execution, when Killigrew was in Venice as the political agent of the exiled Charles II, provides visual evidence, similarly rhetorical, as to how such images of the king were used. Killigrew sits at his desk with a (somewhat larger) portrait of Charles I on the wall behind him. He adopts a classic attitude of melancholy, which in other circumstances might have signified merely his own creative temperament, but which in this context may be taken to connote a stoical, philosophical grief for the executed king. His loyalty to the Stuart cause is further underlined by the copy of the Eikon Basilike that lies beneath the pile of his own plays. It is easy to imagine the embroidered portrait miniature eliciting similar kinds of response.[Jonathan Tavares and Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery

"The gilded moldings and carved decoration on this chair and a matching settee (acc. no. 1992.173.1) frame reverse-painted glass panels, which imitate in different colors the hardstones agate, marble, and lapis lazuli. Close inspection reveals the high quality and intriguingly delicate structure of the paint and the fragility of the panels, which is not evident at  first glance. That the chair and settee have survived in such good condition is testimony to the technical skills of the maker, who provided a sound base for the heavy glass strips, preventing them from peeling away over time. Nevertheless, these are display pieces that were clearly not intended for regular use. The smallest body movement of a user or any attempt to shift or lift the heavy objects puts divergent forces and pressure on their ostentatious ""skin.""The Museum's chair and settee are part of a large suite that originally consisted of at least four settees and twenty side chairs.[1] Early in the twentieth century the set was in the collection of the earl of Derby, at Derby House, London, from where it was sold in 1940 to Mrs. Violet van der Elst, also of London. The pieces were dispersed in 1948.[2] At that time, all items of the suite were covered with the bold red and gold baroque-cut velvet that still decorates the Museum's pieces. For many years it was assumed that the initials ""PPL"" displayed in a medallion on the backs referred to the Villa Palagonia in Bagheria, near Palermo, and, more specifically, to a member of the illustrious Gravina family as a patron;[3] however, as James David Draper pointed out, although ""the peculiarly Sicilian penchant for fashioning an overall look out of glass was most memorably given free rein at the Villa Palagonia, . . . the initials 'PPL' . . . do not correspond with those of any prince of Palagonia and in truth the pieces have a much more pronounced neo-classical severity than the Villa Palagonia ballroom.""[4]John Richardson, the donor of the Museum's pieces, which he had acquired on the London art market, kept them at one point in the Château de Castille in Provence, the home of the Cubist scholar Douglas Cooper,[5] who himself owned at least three chairs from the set.[6] For the moment, the original location of the suite remains a mystery, although the preciousness and labor-intensive nature of the work narrows the source of the commission to one of the great, prosperous, aristocratic families of Sicily.The back of the settee is tripartite; the medallion with initials appears at the top of the center section, but in the same place on the side sections there is a military trophy in the form of a helmet superimposed on a saber. There is a gilded openwork frieze of overlapping ellipses along the top of the back of both the chair and the settee; this appears also along the bottom of the back of the settee but not on the Museum's chair. These ellipses, rather freely adapted from ancient vase paintings, reflect the so-called Etruscan fashion of the last third of the eighteenth century.[7] A very similar pair of chairs, each, however, with an octagonal verre églomisé panel set into the back in place of upholstery, is part of the collection of Juan March Ordinas at Palau March in Palma de Mallorca.[8] That those panels show a mythological chariot in the manner of an ancient vase painting is also very much in the ""Etruscan"" style. The incorporation of glass panels in the center of the backs makes the March chairs even more fragile than the Derby House suite.[9]Other pieces from this suite are preserved in the Art Institute of Chicago (two chairs),[10] the Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida (two settees and two chairs),[11] and the Museum für Kunsthandwerk, Frankfurt am Main (one chair),[12] as well as in various private collections. Some of them have been recovered in shell pink or blue gray fabric with the intention of intensifying the effect of the same shades painted on the glass.[Wolfram Koeppe 2006]Footnotes:[1] Catalogue of a sale at Christie, Manson, and Woods, London, 26 July 1940, lot 41 (sold to Mrs. Violet van der Elst).[2] Catalogue of the Violet van der Elst collection sale, Christie, Manson, and Woods, London, 8 April 1948, lot 114 (ill.).[3] Allen Wardwell.

"British wool embroidery, known as crewel embroidery, was a nearly ubiquitous method of decorating furnishing textiles from the 16th through the 18th centuries. Wool could easily be dyed with the natural dyes of the period in a wide array of vivid colors. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, one of the most popular forms was variations on the Tree of Life motif, inspired by the colorful painted cotton palampores of the same design that were imported into Britain. This pair of bed curtain panels is exceptional for its unusual design, which is more closely related to woven silk textiles of the period. On this grand scale, the leaves also hark back to late medieval decorative cabbage-leaf verdure tapestries. The blue and white palette of the embroidery certainly reflects the immense popularity of the Chinese export and Dutch Delft ceramics that were avidly collected in Britain.These curtain panels would have formed part of a set of hangings, which would have also upper and lower valances, a head cloth, a bed cover or counterpane and wider curtains that would enclose the entire bed when drawn. As the hanging curtains often saw the least amount of physical wear, these are often the elements that survive from a matched set. In addition, the remainder of the textile furnishing in such a bedroom would have coordinated with the bed hangings: seat furniture covers, window curtains and possibly wall hangings.",embroidery
"We may never know what inspired nine-year-old Mary Ann Sadler to convert her mathematics equation into embroidered form. The problem is worked on the basis of the British monetary system using British pounds, shillings, pence (pennies) and farthings. Mary Ann was a student at St. Mark’s School, which was located next to St. Marks’s church on North Audley Street off of Grosvenor Square, near Hyde Park. The school opened in 1831 with the goal of providing the poorer children of the parish with an education at the elementary school level, and it operated in the original building until 1904.",embroidery
"Imported Middle Eastern textiles were highly valued luxury goods during this period, and this velvet pattern was originally the product of the Persian workshops of Tabriz. The number of surviving pieces in European and American collections suggests that this attractive pattern was produced in relatively large quantities; it may have been imitated by Italian velvet weavers and produced for a long period of time.",velvet
"This object is from the collection of Natalia de Shabelsky (1841-1905), a Russian noblewoman compelled to preserve what she perceived as the vanishing folk art traditions of her native country. Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments. Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.The use of gold and pearls indicate that this panel was quite costly. Though it dates from the late-17th to early 18th century, the lace is likely a later edition, probably the later 18th-century.",embroidery
"The initials S.B. in the center of this elaborate collection of darning samples are most likely those of the instructor, as there are several surviving examples with the same initials. It’s possible that these initials belonged to a teacher at an orphan school in Amsterdam, and the other initials in decorative cartouches surrounding the center, and surmounted by crowns on the edges, are likely to be those of other teachers, and administrators or supporters of the institution.",embroidery
"Embroidered in China, this depiction of the abduction of Helen is monumental both in scale and in the freedom granted to the embroiderers, who included many Chinese motifs and interpretations within a purely Western narrative. A quintessential account in the Western classical tradition, the story of the Trojan War inspired large sets of European tapestries; the earliest documented set was presented to Charles the Bold in 1472.¹ This embroidered hanging, too, was part of a large set, of which the Metropolitan Museum owns three, and four are preserved in other collections.² All have the same border, including an armorial at each corner that does not correspond completely with any known arms. Perhaps it is an erroneous rendering of the arms of the Mascarenhas family of Portugal; the nobleman Francisco Mascarenhas served as governor of Macau from 1623 to 1626. The abduction of Helen ignited war between Troy and Greece; this version, in which Helen is forcibly seized, relies on postclassical sources.³ Against a backdrop of European-style buildings with Baroque facades and struggling armored figures, a protesting Helen is carried off by two men, away from her white-bearded husband, Menelaus, and toward a boat on the right where the Trojan prince Paris awaits. No single print source has yet been found, but the subject matter and composition of the hanging were surely based on European sources.⁴The Chinese embroiderers were responsible for many details from the Chinese decorative vocabulary, such as the waves in the background, the phoenixes in the center of the upper border, various details of the armor, the scales of the serpents and tritons in the border, and the lychee fruit seen outlined against the side of the boat. While most of the hanging is embroidered, the figures’ faces and exposed limbs were painted directly on the cotton foundation cloth, probably also in China. Especially in the faces, the modeling of light and shadow for a three-dimensional effect, while naively done, shows an aspect of European-style painting that had reached East Asia with Jesuit missionaries in the sixteenth century. The Italian Jesuit Giovanni Niccolo (or Nicolao, 1563–1626) established an academy of painting in Japan in 1583 to train local artists to produce religious art. When the missionaries’ relations with Japanese authorities deteriorated, Niccolo fled Japan, returning to Macau in 1614. Some of his students became active in China, including You Wenhui (baptized Manoel Pereira, 1575–1633), a young Chinese from Macau, and Ni Yicheng (also known as Jacopo Niva, 1579–1635), of Japanese and Chinese parentage. You Wenhui produced the only surviving painted portrait of the Jesuit leader Matteo Ricci (1552–1610).⁵ The more highly regarded Ni Yicheng had studied at Niccolo’s academy in Japan, and in China he ""was in constant demand to paint works . . . both for the mission in China and the Jesuits’ church in Macau.""⁶ Perhaps these artists or less well-documented colleagues were responsible for painting this textile.  Scientific analysis of the hanging’s pigments supports this intercultural possibility: results show a blue-green pigment not used in Asia and a white not used in Europe. Furthermore, the white pigment occurs more frequently in Japanese than in Chinese contexts.⁷[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1.

"This valance, executed in wool tent stitch with silk highlights, follows a common compositional structure found in large-scale narrative embroideries and tapestries, that of combining multiple scenes in one continuous panel. The valance depicts scenes from courtly life, but the precise narrative has not been identified. Yvonne Hackenbroch titled this piece ""The Education of Princess Elizabeth I"" mainly because of the young child with the man in classical garb, said to be a depiction of Elizabeth I’s tutor, Roger Ascham, but there is no other iconography to support this reading. The embroidery could simply illustrate the daily activities of ladies at court, although the interaction of the various figures implies the existence of a specific sequence of events.One possible iconographical reading lies in the identification of contemporary female personifications of the Five Senses. Reading from left to right, the woman gazing into the mirror may personify Sight; the woman with a falcon gesturing toward the young girl may personify Touch; the woman in profile in front of the fountain may represent Smell as she bends toward a potted flower; and the women playing musical instruments would represent Hearing. However, there is no obvious personification of the sense of taste. Additionally, the older man ushering a young girl toward the woman with the falcon, the presence of the jester, and the woman on horseback suggest that a specific narrative is intended.The valance can be compared to other valances and panels with unidentified narratives; similar scenes with equally opaque narratives involving costumed figures and garden settings, for example, are on two valances in the Musée de la Renaissance, Château d’Écouen, documented by Maria-Anne Privat-Savigny in 2003. These hunting and court scenes are interspersed with dramatically posed figures, such as a woman begging on her knees and two decapitations. Other valances and decorative panels of tent stitch illustrate biblical or mythological tales and, more rarely, historical events.Valances of this type have generally been dated to the late sixteenth century, based in part on the attire of the figures and the woven textile patterns that correspond to those found in extant textiles from the period. The clothing closely relates to costume prints from such books as Cesare Vecellio’s Habiti Antichi e Moderni di Diversi Parti del Mondo (1590) and Pierre Bertelli’s Habits des Diverses Nations (1594); these depictions (the first fashion plates) of the dress of various classes and cultures appear to have circulated widely throughout Europe. The use of tent stitch on canvas appeared in England by the middle of the sixteenth century, although it was practiced earlier in France. Santina Levey credits this technique’s introduction to English furnishing textiles to the influence of the French court. It is difficult, therefore, to attribute definitively many of these designs to one place of manufacture, when they were clearly produced in France, Scotland, and England, based on many of the same sources.This panel was most likely one of a set of bed valances intended to decorate the edges of a tester that hung over a bed in order to cover the attachment points of the bed curtains. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the bed was one of the most important pieces of furniture in the household. The finest sets of hangings would have included embroidered inner and outer valances, curtains, a tester, and a counterpane, in addition to embroidered pillows. Embroidered valances were also used to decorate the tops of walls, typically over a wall surface covered in textiles.[Elyse Gerstenecker, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery
"Band samplers are composed of horizontal rows (""bands"") of embroidered patterns stitched along the linen foundation fabric. Many of the patterns stitched onto band samplers can be traced to sixteenth-century pattern books, and often include depictions of fruit, flowers, and geometric patterns. The top portion of the sampler consists of whitework, while the rest utilizes colored silk threads. The letters HB and the year 1676 are stitched onto the linen, most likely the initials of the maker and the year in which she completed her work.",embroidery
"This band sampler by Margret Barber, probably worked between 1661 and 1663, is divided into rows within three larger sections, each of which showcases a specific technique. The top two-thirds of the sampler includes motifs easily classifiable into standard categories, such as alphabetic characters, geometric designs, and floral motifs, worked in silk and linen on a linen ground using several common stitch techniques. An embroidered alphabet marks the end of the top third of the piece. The middle third is worked with white thread on a white ground, a technique commonly known as whitework. This middle section features scattered design motifs and concludes with an embroidered rendering of the maker’s name and dates of production.The bottom third of the piece is worked in reticella, a technique that originated in the late fifteenth century. The technique developed from cutwork and utilized stitches common to embroidery. Threads were pulled from a plain weave linen fabric to create open spaces in which a design was completed and the deconstructed fabric was stabilized primarily with buttonhole stitches. The result is a design based on the grid of the foundation fabric, with open areas throughout and arched and scalloped borders. Subsequently, the technique progressed to the point where the foundation fabric was eliminated and the design was worked over threads temporarily secured to a piece of vellum or paper for stability during the construction of what was called punto in aria (literally, ""stitches in air""), or early needle lace.Designs for reticella were popularized through numerous editions of late sixteenth-century Continental pattern books. Copies of these books made their way into England, and their popularity occasioned the publication of English pattern books, mostly consisting of patterns copied from the earlier book.Although cutwork and needle-lace techniques continued to be popular, especially for fashionable accessories, through the 1630s, there are very few examples of these techniques that have been attributed to English manufacture, despite the number of English samplers that confirm these skills were taught. The finest lace was imported, although the cost was certainly prohibitive for all but the elite. Therefore, the cultivation of practical skill in whitework and lace techniques would enable the maker to produce all manner of trimming necessary to fashionable attire. This sampler was purchased by London’s Royal School of Needlework in 1916; and it is quite possible that it continued to fulfill its seventeenth-century function of being an exemplar for early twentieth-century students.Samplers containing whitework, cutwork, and needle lace were attempted after basic skills were already mastered, if the case of Martha Edlin can be considered typical. She created her polychrome band sampler first and then move on to the more challenging whitework and cutwork embroidery. Women’s training in this standard progression of technical skills was an extraordinarily important part of a seventeenth-century education, particularly for daughters of the upper class and gentry. According to the household accounts of the Verney family, at least two hours each day were set aside for the practice of embroidery under the instruction of a tutor. It was decided that Sir Ralph Verney’s eight-year-old daughter, ""being a girl she shall not learn Latin, so she will have more time to learn breeding [manners] hereafter and needlework too."" Training in embroidery not only prepared a girl in practical necessities, but it also held a moral dimension. Richard Braithwaite in his 1631 text The English Gentlewoman noted that textile production should be considered ""arguments of [her] industry, memorials of [her] piety."" Women were educated in preparation for marriage, to run a household, and to be a good Christian. Verses from the Bible were often read aloud as women performed household sewing and embroidery, instilling the very activity of working with a needle with pious associations.The use of all three embroidery types—colored, whitework, and lace techniques—on a band sampler is relatively rare compared with simpler combinations of colored bands and whitework. As previously noted, it is uncertain how much actual needle-lace trimming was produced in England during the mid-seventeenth century, but there is a relatively large number of surviving whitework samplers dated to the 1640s. Particularly notable are examples that include figural compositions with detached elements.[Emily Zilber, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery
"Small decorative purses and bags such as this one rarely appear in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century portraits, but they have survived in relatively large numbers.

"Panels representing scenes from The Table of Cebes, a classical text popular during the Renaissance, on the soul’s journey through life, were worked in the somber colors of northern European taste toward the end of the sixteenth century. Like another example in the collection (42.193.2), this one is based on a woodcut by David Kandel of Strasbourg.",embroidery
"Whitework samplers typically consist of a variety of stitches and lace-making techniques, all stitched in white thread. Based on the small number of documented seventeenth-century embroiderers who made multiple samplers, it is thought that samplers containing whitework, cutwork, drawnwork, and lace designs were stitched only after multi-colored band samplers were finished, as whitework techniques are more difficult. While many surviving English samplers include lace, cutwork, and drawnwork, few examples of seventeenth-century lace have been attributed to English manufacture.This sampler is worked in whitework and reticella, which requires a stitcher to remove warp and weft threads from a piece of fabric before stabilizing the fabric with buttonhole stitches and creating designs based on the grid of the linen. The top of the sampler, worked in satin, eye, and line stitches, features the initials ""MD"" (presumably the initials of the maker) and an alphabet, along with geometric and stylized floral patterns of varying length. The remainder of the sampler consists of cutwork filled with reticella lace in geometric patterns.",embroidery
"Raised work, or stumpwork as it is sometimes called, developed in England during the early seventeenth century, and was characterized by its high relief. The technique was used to create pictures and to decorate objects such as storage boxes for jewelry and writing supplies, baskets, and mirror frames. This box is typical of raised-work pieces in that it employs a variety of stitches and includes the use of metal thread and other materials, in addition to colored silks. The faces of the five women representing the Senses are drawn in ink on satin, and the figure of Sight holds a mirror made of mica that reflects her face. Other unexpected materials were frequently used to highlight details: real hair for a figure's head, tiny seed pearls for a necklace, and glass beads for animal eyes.Allegorical and biblical subjects, along with portraits of monarchs, were the most common themes for the decoration of a seventeenth-century box. Of the seven complete and partial boxes in the Museum's collection, the majority show biblical scenes, although these are sometimes combined with depictions of the Senses or the Seasons.Raised work had a rather short period of popularity and was at its peak during the mid-seventeenth century. The creation of raised-work boxes, mirror frames, and pictures ceased to be a fashionable occupation by the turn of the eighteenth century, if not sooner.",embroidery
"This embroidered panel and MMA 64.101.1347 were probably the two ends of a decorative table carpet. The practice of covering tables with precious textiles began in Europe in the thirteenth century, when some imported pile carpets from the Middle East were considered too fine to be walked upon.European personifications of the Four Continents were frequently employed to confer honor and authority on a specific ruler. In this instance, the crowned couple representing ""Europe"" resembles King Charles II of England (r. 1660–85) and his Portuguese wife, Catherine of Braganza (1638–1705), suggesting a prominent position for England in a global context. The motifs of the Seasons and the Planets refer to the passage of time.",embroidery
"Tekke Turkoman women's mantles are typically embroidered, by women, with small motifs in silk thread with a lacing stitch (kesdi). They are worn over the tunic (kurta) cloak-fashion, covering the head and shoulders, with the long vestigial sleeves hanging down the back and joined by an embroidered band. Among the Tekke, the chyrpy's color indicated the age of the wearer: dark blue or black for a young woman, yellow for a married woman of middle age, and white for a matriarch. The motifs were most frequently stylized flowers, and especially the tulip, the most prolific wildflower of the region. The fish in the present piece, however, represent another ubiquitous requirement in Turkoman life, that of good fortune and the provision of protection",embroidery
"Both front and back covers of this richly decorated Bible have images of King David, made in vibrant long-and-short stitch within highly ornate raised cartouches embroidered in metal thread. The front cover shows King David in profile playing his lyre, illuminated by divine rays emanating from above. Yvonne Hackenbroch noted that this standing King David derived from a figure of David on the title page of a Bible published in Cambridge in 1629. Hackenbroch also found the source for the pose of the King David on the back cover, where he is posed facing outward and holding a scepter and lyre: the title page of the third volume of Gerard de Jode’s Thesaurus Novi Testamenti (Antwerp, 1585). The spine of this Bible has five registers, each with a tent-stitch flower typical of this period. The flowers from top to bottom are: tulip, cornflower, rose, pansy, and carnation/pink. The needle-worked binding contains three liturgical texts: the New Testament (in Greek), the Book of Common Prayer, and the Book of Psalms (with musical accompaniment).The image of King David, the supposed author of the Psalms, shown here illuminated by divine rays, was an appropriate and conventional image often used to adorn books of Psalms and other liturgical works; numerous examples survive, both professional and amateur. The British Library has several, including one nearly identical in style to the Metropolitan Museum’s copy. It, too, has been made with the sumptuous materials and high-quality craftsmanship of the professional embroiderer. It has the same raised cartouches with masks on both front and back covers but with different images from the life of David within each surround.The Museum’s Bible is said to have belonged to William Laud (1573–1645), who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633 and was one of Charles I’s chief ministers. This determination is based on an old (though not contemporary) inscription written in ink on the blue silk on the inside front cover: ""This book formerly belonged to Archbishop Laud."" If this is the case, then the book and its richly worked cover assume a powerful symbolic status. Laud was a pivotal and highly divisive figure in early seventeenth-century English religious and political life, primarily because of his attempts to reform the liturgy and to impose on the English church a richly ceremonial form of worship. This stemmed from a particular view of the divine presence within the physical structure of the church itself. The church was, as the Laudian Robert Skinner proclaimed in 1634 in a sermon before the king, the place where ""our Lord God most holy doth inhabit."" It was ""his proper mansion or dwelling place."" Such a notion of divine presence thus infused all objects used in worship with a spiritual aura. For the Laudian Alexander Read in 1636, all such objects were to be held as ""holy in relation to the holy use whereto it is assigned."" Even the cloth bags used to carry the communion bread into the church were special, ""since the very bringing of it into the church to that use is a taking out of the world, a promotion of it to more reverence and a next step to consecration itself."" This attitude promoted the value of beauty in ecclesiastical ornament and decoration. As the anonymous R.T. wrote in 1638, a church should properly contain ""all kinds of ornaments that might add glory and grace . . . as curious paintings, hangings, gilding, sumptuous vestments, rich gifts of money, chalices, plate."" Within its original context, therefore, the Metropolitan Museum’s richly adorned Bible would have seemed, as Lake put it, to ""glow with the beauty of holiness."" The sense of beauty in reverence extended also to ceremonial and ritual aspects of the liturgy, the rubrics for which were contained within the Book of Common Prayer. Strict adherence to the order of the liturgy was regarded as the surest means of true communion with God and indeed constituted for Laud the only legitimate form of prayer. Whether or not the Metropolitan Bible actually belonged to Laud, it nonetheless embodies the Laudian style, both in the text itself—the Book of Common Prayer, which, containing the whole liturgy, stood at the center of Laudian worship—and in the extravagant richness of its decoration, which infuses it with ""the beauty of holiness.""A sincere Protestant, Laud wished to reinstate such practices and objects into the Church of England, which he regarded as historically and theologically accurate and which predated the corruption of the Church of Rome. As the highest prelate in the land, he sought to impose practices such as bowing to the altar (which replaced the communal ""Lord’s table""), the use of incense in the performance of liturgical prayers, and the use of rich vestments in the exercise of the liturgy. Such actions, as well as his resistance to the Puritan emphasis on bibliocentric piety and preaching, alienated both hardline and moderate Puritans. The introduction of what were widely considered Catholic or popish customs provoked significant opposition. The rebellion in Scotland in July 1637—a reaction to the institution of a new form of liturgy modeled on the English Book of Common Prayer—was what forced Charles I to recall Parliament, which in turn set off a series of events leading to the Civil Wars and Laud’s own eventual execution at the hands of Parliament in 1645.[Katy Reed-Basham and Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery

Typically, these bags had drawstring necks, like this one, and flat bases on which the owner’s coat of arms or heraldic devices could be represented, usefully avoiding any debates of ownership amongst competing players, distracted by their game!

"While Lyons was the undisputed center of the silk-weaving industry during the eighteenth century, Genoa provided much of the high-quality velvet for both furnishings and fashion. A specialty was polychrome-velvet weaving, as in this fabric, which possibly was intended to be used for an elegant wide-skirted mantua, or gown. Although the pattern repeat of stylized and seminaturalistic flowers is relatively small, it appears more complex, as it is rendered with seven different colors, a feat of technical virtuosity. The individual motifs are further modeled by juxtaposing cut and uncut (""ciselé"") pile, which reflect light differently. This mutable effect is more dramatic when the fabric is in movement, as one's perception of the colors changes dramatically depending on whether the fabric is vertical or horizontal, flat or draped.",velvet
"On 31 October 1947 Duveen Brothers sold what the firm called ""The Marie Antoinette Set"" for 180,000 dollars to Samuel H. Kress (1863-1955). [1] It consisted of three embroidered wall hangings and various pieces of matched seat furniture that originally belonged to two different eighteenth-century suites, with the addition of several later pieces. [2] The wall hangings-chain-stitched embroideries in silk on a white silk-satin ground-show musical instruments, birds' nests, baskets of flowers, and sun hats linked together with swags of flowers. The present armchair and an identical example, as well as a pair of side chairs of the same design, have eighteenth-century show covers that were made to match these embroideries. In order to give the group of seat furniture a unified appearance, the remaining pieces were upholstered with portions cut from additional embroidered hangings that were sacrificed for this purpose.It is not entirely clear how such an illustrious provenance became attached to this assembled lot. When the settee, which dates to the nineteenth century, was published in 1927, nothing was said about its origin except, erroneously, that the eighteenth-century menuisier Georges Jacob had signed it. [3 In 1934, however, the author of a book on French furniture stated that the set had been made by Jacob for Marie Antoinette (1755-1793), and described it as ""one of the most beautiful examples of the talent of this master."" [4] Furthermore, he declared that the embroidery was the work of the queen and her ladies and that Marie Antoinette gave the entire set to Louis-Jean-Marie de Bourbon, duc de Penthièvre (1725-1793). [5]Stamped by Georges Jacob, who supplied much furniture to the court of Louis XVI (1754-1793), this armchair and its pair have straight, rectangular backs, which characterize them as fauteuils à la reine. When cutting the walnut frames, Jacob must have carefully taken into consideration the planned decoration, leaving enough wood to allow the unidentified but obviously very skilled carver to execute the designs. Particularly striking are the deeply undercut garlands of myrtle branches spiraling around a straight rod on the seat and back rails. Trails of berried myrtle branches are carved around the tapering shafts of the cylindrical legs, which are crowned by collars of laurel leaves and berries. Laurel leaves are also repeated on the front of the curving arm supports that terminate in acanthus-leaf volutes. A molding of pearls and twisted-rope motifs carved along the top of the seat rail gives a rhythmical effect not unlike that created by brass upholstery nails-here absent because the chairs are covered à châssis. The original slip seat and webbing have been preserved. The back panel, edge roll, arm pads, and comfortable down and feather seat cushion are all covered in the original late-eighteenth-century embroidered silk-satin. [6] The back displays floral branches framed by scrolling floral borders. The seat cushion shows a basket of flowers within similar borders. Certain motifs, such as the band of pearls along the fore edge of the seat as well as along the borders of the cushion and of the back, clearly relate to the carving of the wooden frame. The high quality of the once very colorful chain-stitched embroidery clearly identifies it as professional work rather than as the fruit of the queen's pastime. The elegant floral compositions are close to designs by the famed silk manufacturer Philippe de Lasalle (1723-1804/5).From a series of marks, inscriptions, and inventory numbers on the frames of both armchairs a considerable amount of information can be gleaned. [7] First of all, the incised roman numerals VII and VIII indicate that they were numbers seven and eight of a suite that included both arm- and side chairs, and possibly one or more settees. It was not unusual for a chairmaker to identify the various elements, especially such removable parts as slip seats and arm pads, as belonging to a certain chair, to avoid mixing them up.The French inscription ""de P[enthiè]vre Paris Chambre à Balus[tre]"" (and a variation of this) is enlightening as well, showing that the chairs were in the possession of the wealthy duc de Penthièvre, grand admiral of France and a cousin of Louis XVI. The set furnished his Paris residence, the Hôtel de Toulouse, an early-seventeenth-century building on the rue de la Vrillière, near the place des Victoires. By 1719 the architect Robert de Cotte (1656-1735) had renovated the mansion for the duc de Penthièvre's father, the comte de Toulouse.[8] The hôtel had, according to a late-eighteenth-century description, a chambre des balustres, or room with balustrade on the ground floor. [9] Used only on special occasions, this room was a chambre de parade, or ceremonial bedchamber. A curving balustrade, or estrade, seen in a plan by Jacques-François Blondel (1705-1774), closed off a bed alcove separating the state bed from the rest of the room . [10] To have such a balustrade was a privilege, allowed only in the state apartments of dukes, princes, and grands seigneurs. [11] The formal nature of the Museum's armchairs as so-called fauteuils meublants, placed along the wall and considered to be part of the interior decoration, reflects the official function of the room. Given the various other French inscriptions on the frames, it is possible that the chairs were also used in a different part of the house. It has been suggested that the entire set was placed in the first-floor apartment of the duke's widowed daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse-Louise, princesse de Lamballe (1749-1792), a friend of Marie Antoinette's. [12]After the duc de Penthièvre's death his only surviving daughter, Louise-Marie-Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre (1753-1821), inherited his possessions. Married to the liberal Louis-Philippe-Joseph, duc d'Orléans (1747-1793), who renounced his title and became known as Philippe-Égalité, she was widowed when he was guillotined during the Reign of Terror in 1793. She was exiled from France, and her property including the Hôtel de Penthièvre (Toulouse) was confiscated in 1797. The chairs may then have come into the possession of the banker Gabriel-Julien Ouvrard (1770-1846), whose name is written on stickers affixed to the slip seats. Having amassed a huge fortune in war speculations, Ouvrard became purveyor to the French navy in 1798. He apparently acquired several of the confiscated estates of the Orléans family that were, however, returned to them in 1814. The ""B125"" marks on the chairs probably refer to one of these properties, perhaps the eighteenth-century Château de Bizy, in Normandy, where the duc de Penthièvre died and his daughter lived after her return from exile. An inventory of the Château de Bizy described the Salon de Famille as furnished with hangings of white silk-satin embroidered with floral designs, and it listed a large set of seat furniture in the same room that was upholstered to match. This inventory was drawn up shortly after 1830, when the castle was in the possession of the son of Philippe-Égalité, Louis-Philippe (1773-1850), duc d'Orléans, who became king of France in 1830.The crowned, interlaced monogram ""LPO"" on the chairs clearly refers to his ownership, and he may have been responsible for uniting the two sets. It has been said that Louis-Philippe left the assembled seat furniture to his youngest daughter, Marie-Clémentine (1817-1907), who lived in Austria after her marriage to Prince Augustus of Saxe-Coburg. [13] Some years after her death, in September 1913, Duveen Brothers, the well-known antiques dealership with branches in London, Paris, and New York, acquired this set of furniture.

Kress Foundation to the Museum. They included two armchairs (acc. nos. 58.75.25,26) and two matching side chairs (58.75.33,34) all stamped by Georges Jacob. There were also two similar armchairs (58.75.30,31) and one small settee, or marquise (58.75.27), also by Jacob but part of another set. In addition, there were a settee (58.75.24), two armchairs (58.75.29,32), and a second marquise (58.75.28) executed at a later date to match the design of accession numbers 58.75.27,30,31. The wall hangings have the accession numbers 58.75.35-37. See Dauterman, Parker, and Standen 1964, pp. 61-75, nos. 7-9.3. Feulner 1927, p. 675, fig. 600.

Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs.

"In the early modern period, gloves were essential accessories. As today, they had practical functions: they were used for protection or warmth, and, in some cases, perfumed gloves were used for medical purposes. Yet they were also potent extensions of social actions; they were symbols of status and obligation, thrown down in challenge or treasured as tokens of affection. In this way, gloves were a conspicuous pleasure—in paintings, they are frequently held rather than worn. This pair features preening birds of paradise, carnations, roses, and tiny borages—possibly inspired by those in La Clef des Champs (1586) and A schole-house, for the needle (1632)—and set within arabesques. The tabbed, gauntlet-style was popular for displaying elaborate, expensive professional embroidery, as the tabs are slightly gusseted to fit over the wearer’s intricate lace cuffs. The wide cuff also complemented the long, tapering fingers that extend beyond the fingertips, lengthening the hand and emphasizing exemption from manual work. And, of course, the metallic embellishments would have brilliantly glimmered in the light. -Sarah Bochicchio, 2020",embroidery
"This needlepoint hanging depicts a scene from the Tabula Cebetis (The Table of Cebes), a treatise long wrongly believed to have been written by Socrates' disciple Cebes that enjoyed great popularity as a Latin reader in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  The text describes a painting displayed in the Temple of Saturn in Thebes that showed the journey through life and the pathway to true happiness. This hanging depicts the penultimate episode in the journey: the protagonist is beckoned from his path by a woman representing False Learning. Elegant figures in courtly dress are distracted from true wisdom and happiness by dedicating too much energy to the pursuit of knowledge through debate, philosophy, geometry, astrology and alchemy, geography, astronomy, arithmetic, and music.This hanging is one of a set of three (the others are in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris and the Metropolitan Museum). Their design was adapted from a woodcut illustrating The Table of Cebes made by David Kandel of Strasbourg in 1547. Notwithstanding the difference in scale (the woodcut is just over 12 by 15 inches), the designer of the embroidery borrowed the principal figures from the woodcut's central scene, inventively adding a warm palette of greens, reds, and yellows. The whole is enclosed by an imaginative border of cavorting grotesques and includes the coat of arms of the De Fenis de Prade family surrounded by the collar of the Order of Saint Michael (upper left) and a second unidentified armorial enclosed by a widow's cordeliere (upper right). With its monumental scale, this needlework is a rare surviving example of a fashion for embroideries that emulated the scale and appearance of tapestries, their more expensive woven counterparts.",embroidery
"This sampler features both colored silk embroidery and white cutwork, in addition to a bobbin lace edging (probably a later addition). Unfinished acorn and oak leaf, flower pot, and geometric motifs are stitched in a light brown thread on the top half of the sampler, while cutwork and drawnwork geometric patterns are present on the work’s bottom half and top left corner. Cutwork, from which needle lace developed, is a technique in which portions of the ground fabric are cut away and reinforced with embroidery stitches and filled in with needle lace. While many surviving English samplers include lace, cutwork, and drawnwork, very few examples of seventeenth-century lace have been attributed to English manufacture.",embroidery

"While the Portuguese were undoubtedly the first importers and consumers of the Indian embroideries made for the western European market, at least a few examples of these textiles did appear in England by the late sixteenth century. The 1601 inventory of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury (1527-1608), included two quilts that were almost certainly products of this trade: “a quilt of yellow India stuff embroidered with birds and beasts” and “a quilt of India stuff embroidered with beastes.""¹ Indian quilts of the type produced for the Portuguese market appeared with increasing frequency in London sales into the 1620s, when their value began to decline, perhaps because of diminishing novelty.²The taste for Indian-style embroidery remained, however, and it is interesting to note that the English maker of this textile used not only the Indian palette of golden yellow on white but also an imported Indian cotton as the foundation. The cover has rare seventeenth-century marks on the plain-weave cotton fabric: the initials G.C.E. (for the English East India Company's original name, The Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies) as well as three other stamps whose significance has not yet been deciphered.³ On this bedcover, the embroidered designs draw heavily on such exotic motifs as pineapple-like vegetation and serrated leaves, but contemporary European sensibilities are also evident in the strapwork connecting the floral elements. Additionally, the three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the use of stitches with long floats that create a shinier surface to contrast with the matte appearance of the cotton ground diverge from the Indian prototypes, whose flatter chain stitches are less glossy. English bedcovers were usually part of coordinated sets that could include bolsters, pillows, and matching valances⁴In addition to the more common monochrome yellow-on white embroideries, Indian polychrome embroideries also arrived in England during the early seventeenth century. They, too, are described in sale records; for example, a 1614 sale included “a carpet or quilt embroidered upon calico with sundry silks.""⁵  The word “carpet” is probably used in its contemporaneous sense, that is, to signify decorative covers for a variety of furniture types, including beds. MMA 1970.173, an English polychrome silk and metal-thread bedcover, is more obviously dependent on the stylistic composition of Persian and Turkish carpets than this textile. By the eighteenth century, both embroidered and painted cotton textiles of this type, with a central medallion and smaller medallions in the corners of the central field, were being made in India for domestic consumption and for export.⁶  These imported polychrome covers had a lasting influence on the production of English embroidered bed furnishings of the eighteenth century.

"Gloves are replete with associations to love, honor, and loyalty, and these accessories played an important symbolic role in the portraiture of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As a surrogate for their owner, gloves could be indicative of both romantic love or political allegiance, as when a woman's glove was bestowed upon her chosen contestant to be worn in a tournament.The gauntlets on this pair of gloves contain small birds and flaming hearts, surely symbols of romantic devotion. The symbol of the flaming heart in a cartouche also appears in a Dutch collection of embroidery designs for fashionable accessories, dating to the 1620s, in the Museum's collection.",embroidery

"The highly skilled maker who executed these gloves chose an intricate design—floral yet geometric—that alludes to the more simple versions found in early seventeenth century pattern books. As scholars have pointed out, pattern books for needlework and lacemaking, which were marketed towards women of the middling classes, presented an opportunity for upward mobility at a time when wealth was partially measured in fine possessions. The elite classes might hire artists and professionals to design and carry out, and thus distinguish their own embroidered goods. This pair of gloves features French knots, couching and raised work on purple satin in colored silk, silver and gilded silver thread, further ornamented with spangles and bobbin lace. The rich coloring and metallic details would have made a dramatic impression as they caught the light; the color palette is repeated in a later pair in the museum’s collection (2003.461a, b). -Sarah Bochicchio, 2020",embroidery
"This pictorial panel is unusual in that it is worked almost entirely in crewel wool thread, with only details and highlights in silk and metallic threads. Wool was commonly used for tent stitch or needlework on canvas from the sixteenth century, but this fiber is unusual in pictorial works such as this. Wool is more commonly found on bed furnishings of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries on a cotton twill foundation fabric.The presence of initials and a date probably indicate that this was an amateur production in both design and execution. The composition, which is extraordinarily crowded and naive, even within the genre of seventeenth-century pictures, is a small compendium of religious imagery, each story rendered in a kind of shorthand with only the key scene in the narrative nestled within the pictorial landscape conventions of this type. Hagar and Ishmael, banished from the home of Abraham, exit the scene in the lower left corner, while the princess of Egypt finds the baby Moses to the right. The river that delivered Moses flows from a rocky grotto, home to a mermaid, several types of fantastic fish, and a duck. Above the mermaid’s head at the right, Rebecca offers a drink to Eliezer from an antique urn on which the date 1667 is embroidered. The identity of the king under the central canopy is not certain, but he most likely represents Solomon sitting in judgment, as a woman appears to be pleading for a child in the arms of a cavalier with a sword. This interpretation is strengthened by the presence of a colorful moth or butterfly below the king. If we accept this as a symbol of the restoration of the Stuart monarchy, then the biblical Solomon, with whom King Charles I (father of the contemporary king) had been identified, would have been an appropriate choice. The rest of the panel is populated with flora and fauna, rendered with a typical disregard for relative scale, and a stately home with two small faces behind the mica windows. This particular conflation of religious and secular imagery is interesting for its visual emphasis on the central figure of the king, with other references scattered in a seemingly random fashion around the composition.[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery
"Woven and embroidered textiles commissioned by noble families were among the most expensive expressions of wealth and power during the Renaissance. The production of luxurious silks was tightly regulated in order to ensure quality, and the movements of weavers were sometimes restricted to prevent the loss of technical and artistic advantages to rival city-states such as Venice, Milan, and Genoa. This stylized floral velvet is woven with a variation on a motif found in the Medici family coat of arms: the seven balls called palle (here, in the center of the largest flower). The placement of the red velvet circles on a background of golden thread draws attention to this feature. The original use of these fragments is not known; they might have been part of a liturgical vestment or a secular fragment.",velvet
"One of a group of textiles whose production is attributed to the area of Satgaon in Bengal¹, coverlets such as this were made primarily for the Portuguese market, hence the Portuguese term (colcha) by which they are known. In the early seventeenth century they also fetched high prices at auctions in England and seem to have influenced the production of embroidery there (see MMA 34.104.1 and MMA 1970.173). Characterized by the use of yellow tussah silk embroidery on a white cotton ground, they typically depict a combination of classical, biblical, and Hindu themes, although a few draw from other sources (see e.g. Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, no. T20e4). This colcha is embellished with a selection of vignettes found on several others, including an almost identical example in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon.² Successive bands around the border depict a hunt, the Labors of Hercules, and the story of Arion, while the center panel features the Judgment of Solomon surrounded by stories from the book of Judith: the siege of Bethulia (bottom right), Judith before Holofernes (top right), Judith beheads Holofernes (top left), and the severed head of Holofernes displayed from the walls of Bethulia (bottom left). Vignettes from classical mythology include Actaeon transformed into a stag by Diana (above the Solomon scene), Hercules shooting the Lernean Hydra (detail), and the story of Phaeton, who drove the chariot of the sun too close to Earth, scorching the planet and causing the animals to die (in the triangular panel below Hercules). While the themes of these coverlets can be generally related to contemporary European tapestries and textiles, which also mix biblical and classical tales, the depiction of the protagonists in seventeenth-century Portuguese garb and the addition of Hindu imagery (such as the story of the Vishnu avatar Matsya, the fishtailed figure in the second band from the center) must represent the traditions and imagination of the embroiderers who created them. The circulation of northern European prints and illustrated Bibles at the Mughal court is well documented, but the sources available to the Bengali embroiderers remain obscure and probably represent an entirely different category of material. The inventiveness of the embroidery is further underscored by comparison to those made for the local market. Two pieces that likely date to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century are embroidered in multicolored silk, and their design is composed of circular medallions enclosing lotus patterns, interlocking star shapes, and bands of human figures and animals.³ Here, then, the switch to an almost monochrome yellow and white palette, the composition of concentric panels and bands, and the addition of foreign iconography were innovations for this particular type of export, which was produced only until the mid-seventeenth century.

"This type of glove, made of substantial leather with the hand and wrist gauntlet in one piece, may have been worn for practical protection by a person of means, despite the presence of silk and metallic thread embroidery, which to the modern eye would render the gloves impractical. Unlike other gloves of the time, which have separately constructed and highly decorated gauntlets that appear far too fragile to wear, this pair would have been relatively functional.These gloves were said to have belonged to James I, primarily because of the presence of the Scottish thistle in the embroidery, but there is no conclusive evidence of this connection. This attribution was first asserted by W. B. Redfern in 1904 and repeated by Frances Morris in 1929. As an insignia of royalty after James’s accession to the English throne, the thistle motif was usually combined with the Tudor rose to represent the union of England and Scotland under one ruler, as on an early seventeenth-century embroidered cushion cover with the royal arms surmounted by a large rose and two small stylized thistles, now held in the Victoria and Albert Museum.Beginning in the late sixteenth century, gloves play an increasingly visible role in portraiture, and their functions were practical as well as symbolic. This pair may be similar to the type of leather glove with metallic thread fringe described in the wardrobes of both sons of James I, as described in surviving inventories and bills for both princes’ wardrobes. Accounts from about 1608 for Henry, Prince of Wales, included ""four pair of staggs leather gloves, perfumed and fringed with gold and silver fringe, at 16s."" And his younger brother, Charles, when he was king, ordered similar gloves in even larger quantities during the 1630s: ""2 dozen pairs of thick stags lether gloues with gold and silver fringes."" Charles I is also depicted wearing a similar pair of gloves of gray-brown leather with embroidered gauntlets and metallic thread fringe in Daniel Mytens’s 1629 portrait of the king (MMA, 06.1289).[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery

"This portrait is worked with large stitches that mimic engraved or etched cross-hatchings, which, along with the framing device, link the portrait to the print medium from which it is derived. This graphic effect is particularly apparent in the brick stitch used as the ground in the border around the oval frame. It is unusual that the embroiderer has adopted the printmakers’ and painters’ convention of signing his work at the bottom of the image: ""R. Hayes Fecit."" This claim to professional status makes it likely that R. Hayes was indeed a professional embroiderer, and this is consistent with the evenness of stitching. It is most evident in the rendering of Charles’s flowing hair, where the embroiderer has articulated the graceful ringlets by twisting the silk floss at the tips of the gathered curl to create a play of light that closely approaches the nature of human hair.The embroidery is derived from a popular image of Charles I, which was made after his execution and exists in at least two prints: an engraving by Edward Bower, published by Robert Preeke in 1649, and an etching produced by Wenceslaus Hollar in the same year (MMA, 17.50.85). Although Yvonne Hackenbroch suggests the former as the direct print source for this embroidery, it is in fact closer to the Hollar version, in the exact transcription of the pose, in the king’s size and position relative to the oval surround, and in such details as the gloved hand and the cloak embroidered with the emblem of the Order of the Garter. John Peacock has posited that the Hollar portrait drew upon the painted portrait of Charles I Wearing the Garter Star of about 1632 by Anthony van Dyck and an ""idiosyncratic"" etching of Charles I by George Lid, published as a frontispiece of A Continuation of Lucan of 1630. From the former, he derived the general disposition of pose and details of costume, including the emblazoned Garter Star, and from the latter, the idea of showing the king wearing a broad-brimmed hat. That Charles wears the hat in several posthumous prints and in the embroidered portrait is a probable reference to his attire in court, when, as Hackenbroch pointed out, ""Charles declined to take his hat off during the trials lest this gesture be interpreted as a sign of respect towards his Judges."" In the embroidered portrait, this reference, combined with an aureole of light emanating from behind him, confers upon the image of the king both the specificity of an historical memory and an iconic aura appropriate to its commemorative function.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery

Although not as common as other biblical scenes rendered in needlework, the numerous depictions of the story of Elijah in paintings and engravings show how familiar these stories would have been to their seventeenth-century audience. Yvonne Hackenbroch suggested a likely source for the front of the embroidered cover in Gerard de Jode’s late sixteenth-century Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamentis, although some of the costumes were updated from this source to reflect contemporary fashion.Two factors lead to the conclusion that this decorated binding is the work of an amateur: the level of proficiency of the embroiderer and the presence of initials, presumably those of the maker. The techniques and materials employed are fewer and simpler than are commonly seen on Bible covers of a professional caliber; the two scenes from the life of Elijah are worked in tent stitch on canvas, which would have been made separately and then applied to the satin background of the book binding. The scenes are then framed in a cartouche of silk-wrapped purl thread, which is applied in a couching technique that would be relatively simple to work. A knot stitch is used on the satin background to make the floral border and the maker’s initials M.B., as well as the spine, which is covered in six registers of flora and fauna. Although tedious to work in this quantity, the stitch is not terribly difficult. The fact that this Bible and Book of Psalms were decorated by an amateur embroiderer shows that the skills so important to a young woman’s education were put to use in the making of decorative objects necessary to a properly appointed household.Like cabinets decorated with raised-worked panels, the finished cover would probably have been delivered, along with the book itself, to a binder who specialized in the application of decorative covers. The same craftsman may have applied the decorative silver metal trim to the edges, as well as the gold metal clasps. The publication date of a book cannot be used as conclusive evidence for the date of any type of cover. However, it is probable that books intended to receive decorative textile covers were intentionally constructed with smooth spines, in order to facilitate the application of the cover and to avoid interrupting the design, unlike the spines with protruding cords, which are commonly found on leather bound books of the period. Nevertheless, the embroidery design on the spine imitates the appearance of leather bindings with the horizontal cords and panels in between.[Katy Reed-Basham and Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery

"This splendid crimson velvet with pink voided areas and others brocaded with silver-wrapped yellow thread reflects the international style common in Turkey, Iran, Syria, and Egypt in the late fifteenth century.

"This panel was probably intended as a cushion cover. It illustrates scenes from the life of the biblical patriarch Abraham, as recounted in the Book of Genesis. The central scene shows Abraham being informed by a host of angels that his wife Sarah will bear him a son, despite her advanced age. Other scenes include Abraham banishing his servant Hagar and her son by Abraham, Ishmael (lower left corner), and Abraham's attempted sacrifice of Sarah's son Isaac, the act he was ordered by God to perform as a test of his faith (upper right corner).Biblical narratives were extremely popular subjects for seventeenth-century pictorial embroideries, and a number of other examples depicting the life of Abraham exist. The imagery of the Museum's example is derived from engravings after Maarten de Vos which first appeared in Gerard de Jode's 1579 illustrated bible Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamenti, published in Antwerp. These engravings were also the inspiration for other biblical embroideries, such as the story of David and Bathsheba, and David and Abigail (see 64.101.1325).",embroidery
"The settees and chairs illustrated here (see 1974.356.114–.121) were made for the Franckenstein Pavilion in the gardens of Seehof Castle near Bamberg, one of the three summer residences in Southern Germany used by Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, prince bishop of Würzberg and Bamberg. A true garden enthusiast, it was under von Seinsheim that the gardens of Seehof were embellished, which must have resembled the still extant Rococo gardens completed by von Seinsheim at Veitshöchheim. His love for gardens and garden imagery also carried over into the interior decoration and furnishings of his castles, as the Seehof furniture demonstrates. A unique example of German Rococo furniture executed in a more flamboyant style than its French prototypes, the ensemble was designed specifically for the Garden Room in the Franckenstein Pavilion. Used as an audience room, it was referred to as the ""Green Trellis Chamber"" in the 1774 Seehof inventory and painted entirely with trompe l'oeil trellis and foliage. The garden room's furniture was made to match: the backs of the chairs and settees are richly carved in the form of garden trellis-work with colored flowers and foliage.",velvet

"Constructed from two different fabrics, this chasuble was probably made and used in Portugal in a Jesuit context. The body of the garment is a Portuguese white silk of the late seventeenth—early eighteenth century brocaded with polychrome silk and chenille yarns. The bright white satin ground of the center panels at front and back are embroidered with silk and silver threads; the materials of this center panel, including the satin ground fabric, are likely from Asia.¹ Narrow metallic woven bands, or galloons, outline the panels and neckline.²A variety of images—including fanciful fountains, unicorns amid cypress trees, spotted leopards, peacocks with tails in full display, and several figures including Hercules and the haloed Christ Child—have been scattered by the weaver throughout the largely secular brocade of the side panels.³ In contrast, the subject matter of the embroidered center panels is entirely Christian. On the front panel are the embroidered initials IHS, the Latin anagram for Jesus Christ used by the Jesuits, while the back panel bears a superimposed A and M for ""Ave Maria"" (or Hail Mary), the archangel Gabriel’s salutation to the Virgin as reported in Luke 1:28. Above the two letters is a crown, and the entire image is surrounded by lilies. An embroidered inscription, qui pascitu inter lilia, a phrase from the Song of Songs (6:3) that translates as ""He who feedeth among the lilies,"" surrounds a silver Paschal Lamb (representing the Lamb of God). Other Christian symbols in the panels include the Pelican in Her Piety, a flowering rose, and a silver pomegranate. The many references to the Virgin in the imagery suggest that this chasuble was used in a convent or in a Jesuit church dedicated to Marian devotion.⁴This elaborate embroidery, with its variety of silk and metallic threads, shares traits and materials from both Portugal and Asia. The multicolor bands that represent the pelican, for example, are typical of Philippine embroidery (detail), yet the bright yellow dye is weld, a European dyestuff.⁵ The flatness of the needlework and its limited palette, as well as the detailed rendering of the individual feathers at the tips of the birds’ wings, are features that may be more Asian than European. A Peruvian example, based on an Asian model, also depicts bird feathers in this way.⁶  It may be that the embroidery took place in Portugal, with artisans also following the Asian model, using a composite of Asian and Portuguese materials. [Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1. The brocade, a five-harness silk on a white satin ground with weft float patterning, includes a number of different colors and types of yarns. Some are unspun silk, others are plied two-color (black and white), and still others are chenille yarns with a pile. The two center panels are a white satin seven-harness ground fabric with warp and weft yarns bearing no twist, which likely was imported from China. The embroidery for the silk is satin stitch, with couching stitches to hold the metallic yarns that outline the designs. The embroidery is sparse, revealing the white background throughout. 2. The tape is composed of weft-faced plain weave with silk warp and silk wrapped with metal-sheet weft. 3. This imagery is related to that in a more narrative panel with a large fountain as its central motif (Metropolitan Museum, acc. no. 35.30). Adele Weibel has identified this type of fabric as either Portuguese or from Extremadura in Spain and believes that a group of related textiles with fountains and chenille threads were produced by the same (unknown) master weaver; see Weibel, Two Thousand Years of Textiles, pp. 151—52, nos. 272 and 276.

"The stylized floral design of this textile is delineated by fine lines of green silk velvet; the rest of the surface is covered with gold metal-wrapped threads, lying flat in the background and forming loops in the plant forms. The large flowering plant in the center and the vine that surrounds it can be identified as Sempervivum tectorum (now commonly known as ""hens and chicks""), a species of hardy succulent that has the ability to thrive in extreme mountainous conditions. Recent research has revealed that this plant motif was associated with the Sforza family of Milan starting in the mid-fifteenth century. Variations on this pattern were also produced as monochrome pile-on-pile silk velvets and the Museum has red and green examples.",velvet
"This sampler, which features various geometric motifs, and an alphabet, is typical of Marken Island samplers, which are characterized by bands of colorful patterns. Girls stitched these bands to practice patterns for ""vernaaide linten""- ribbons that were attached to a cap and which were an important part of the costume tradition on Marken Island. These ribbons consisted of black embroidery on white linen. The women of Marken are said to have kept their samplers in or near their kitchens for handy reference, so much of the needlework appears darkened from residue from cooking fires. Samplers from this area, including this one, often include striped horses. Other motifs include a ship, dog in a house or other enclosure, and striped rooster. The initials ""LP,"" which are stitched several times, are probably the initials of the sampler’s maker.",embroidery

"At some point fairly early in its history, the many small pieces of fabric included in this booklet were seamed together and loosely bound, to create a kind of glossary of colored and monochrome openwork patterns. Scraps of silk, glove leather and writing paper with Portuguese text were employed to stabilize the pages. The recycling of materials and the compact nature of the booklet all suggest that this was a purely practical reference work for a professional seamstress, and was not meant for display.

"This object is from the collection of Natalia de Shabelsky (1841-1905), a Russian noblewoman compelled to preserve what she perceived as the vanishing folk art traditions of her native country. Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments. Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.",embroidery
"This orphrey band is an extraordinary example of complex and highly refined embroidery. The depiction of the faces of the roundel figures is lifelike and animated and there is whimsy in the winged creatures who appear to be blowing trumpets but actually are leaves emanating from the central plant motif. The enormous detail in curvilinear forms includes the swag of the draperies, sinuous curling vines and leaves and the curling tails of the winged figures. This panel was probably one of two panels on a cope. This piece has been cut, which accounts for the single orientation of the roundels and the slightly shorter length than would be needed to accommodate a cope. There is some indication that it was also used as a wall hanging, which would be evidence of its having been altered from its original use.",embroidery

The warp of the fragment's ground woven component is made of course, long wool fibers from the back of Turcana sheep. Highly twisted during spinning and dying, these fibers give desirable weight and stiffness to the apron.

"In mentioning cards, I ought to observe, that . . . [the French] learn to play not barely for amusement, but also with a view to advantage; and, indeed, you seldom meet with a native of France, whether male or female, who is not a complete gamester, well versed in all the subtleties and finesses of the art.— Tobias Smollett, Travels through France and ItalyAs gaming was the principal indoor diversion of eighteenth-century France, a variety of tables was created, often for specific games like three-handed ombre or tri, piquet, or brelan. A description of one example in Lazare Duvaux’s account book suggests that this elegant folding table was used for quadrille. On August 9, 1753, the dealer sold a solid mahogany quadrille table ""I"" (folding on the diagonal), embellished with gilt bronze, and lined with cloth, to Madame de Pompadour for 85 livres.[1]When closed, the Museum’s table has a triangular shape and forms a synthesis of sinuous lines, echoed by the double curve of the cabriole legs. One of these S-shaped legs can be pulled backward to support the hinged top when unfolded. A shallow walnut drawer for storage of game essentials is recessed on top of this sliding leg. The rounded corners of the open top could be used for discarded cards and counters or for the placement of candlesticks to offer the players light on their game. Although not stamped, this table has been attributed to Bernard II van Risenburgh, based on the high quality of its tulipwood marquetry inlaid with floral and foliated sprays of end-cut kingwood.Epigraph.

"Ecclesiastical garments were meant to contribute to the sense of mystery and awe associated with worship; this beautifully crafted dalmatic and maniple exemplify that practice. The depiction of the saints is artfully rendered, the skin tones expressed in applied silk with facial features and other details, such as hair and the definition of fingers depicted in embroidery. The monk's costume is recreated in particularly fine detail, down to the knotted cord chinstrap on his hat. The saints have been identified as St. Bonaventure, in Franciscan habit, wearing a cardinal's hat and holding a book and crosier, and St. John the Baptist in a brown camel's hair tunic and red mantle, holding Lamb of God and a banner. This dalmatic and maniple are part of a set that includes a cope (2009.300.3410), a two chasubles (2009.300.2949 and 2009.300.2952a–c) and a second dalmatic (2009.300.3411a, b).",embroidery

"This chasuble is from a set of six vestments—also including a stole, maniple, burse, chalice veil, and chalice cover—whose quality, extent, and provenance make the group an important addition to the Museum's fine collection of ecclesiastical costume. The chasuble's embroidered decoration-a nearly symmetrical pattern of full-blown, seminaturalistic flowers, small blossoms, curving leaves, and scrolls—is an excellent example of the style of late Baroque ornament used to embellish Italian vestments from the end of the seventeenth century to the middle years of the eighteenth. The robust flowers, worked in long and short stitches, French knots, and metallic loops, are carefully modeled in four to five shades of silk. The metallic thread is primarily used in laid and couched work, cursively following the contours of the motifs and secured in twill or chevron patterns with yellow silk. Although it is often impossible to identify the specific place of manufacture of such embroideries, documentation accompanying this gift proposes western Sicily. Attestations given in 1915 in Partanna and Mazara del Vallo state that according to tradition this set of vestments was a gift to Nicolo Spedaliere (also recorded as Spitaleri), head priest of the mother church of Partanna, from his bishop. Furthermore, the superior of the Collegia di Maria, which was founded in 1681 in Mazara del Vallo, avers that since that time schools and women's religious orders have existed throughout the diocese in which embroidery like this example as well as other types were practiced.",embroidery
"The canvas ground of this spot sampler is a crowded, asymmetrical flurry of ornamental designs; these include fauna, such as birds, snails, a boar, and butterflies; a variety of fantastic flora in the form of flowering and fruiting branches and stylized blossoms known as slips; and geometric interlacing patterns similar to those of newly fashionable ""knot"" parterres, designs for which were first published in England by Thomas Hyll in his Proffitable Art of Gardening (1568). The sampler is divided roughly into two parts, with the natural world presented at the top and geometric motifs below.Spot samplers may have come closest to fulfilling the etymological destiny of the sampler, or exemplar, as ""an example to be imitated; a model, pattern; an archetype."" They are composed of collections of patterns and stitches to which the maker might refer when she was in need of inspiration or guidance for a particular technique. They generally do not include a date or a name in the body of the work that would allow a connection to be made with an embroiderer at a certain point in her education.A. J. B. Wace cited the existence of samplers as early as the beginning of the sixteenth century, writing that one was purchased for Elizabeth of York, who died in 1503, and that Elizabeth, Countess of Oxford, who died in 1537, left her two sisters twelve samplers in her will, although it is not clear that these were the work of her own hand. The earliest extant English sampler is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum; it was inscribed and dated by Jane Bostock in 1598. A sampler with a very similar composition to the present example composed of tent-stitch slips and animals above a group of geometric designs worked in silk and metal threads, is also in the Victoria and Albert Museum (inv. no. T.234-1928). Spot samplers were originally dated to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century, but more recently they have been reassigned to the mid-seventeenth century on the basis of a group of dated spot samplers that Carol Humphrey has brought to light. Spot samplers are relatively rare survivals compared to seventeenth century band samplers, which may result from their continuing usefulness as pattern references, a function that would have worn them out. The fact that these are rarely dated or signed may indicate that some are the work of professional teachers or embroiderers, in which case they would not have been treasured and saved by the descendants of the makers in the same way as ""schoolgirl"" accomplishments. Nevertheless, early in their existence they were certainly valued by the women who actually referred to them. The manner in which the maker of this sampler used materials and the fact that several individual motifs in this piece were left half-finished suggest that this is the first draft of a final work. Once the maker had mastered the technique and produced enough of the design to judge the final effect, there was no need to waste precious materials, particularly metal threads, and time in completing the motif.Geometric patterns similar to those found on this sampler were used on small purses and other decorative accessories; a cushion in the Colonial Williamsburg collection (inv. no. 1967-62), for example, is decorated with a similar diamond-shaped motif. It has been suggested that the tent-stitch motifs, or slips, on spot samplers were intended to be cut out and applied to another ground fabric for the production of valances, bed hangings, or cushion covers. It seems more likely that these were intended to be saved as design ideas rather than used in another end product. Surviving unused slips suggest that when these were worked in any quantity for use in appliqué, they were organized methodically in rows of identical motifs, rather than squeezed into the available space at different angles of orientation.[Emily Zilber, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery

"Embroidered in China with a dragon roundel at its center and four distinctive figures dressed in European garments in the surrounding field, this coverlet reflects the two disparate worlds of East and West and the contradictions that arose from artistic exchange between them. The men wear breeches and doublets, whose style and cut generally conform to late sixteenth- and early seventeenth century European dress.¹ Yet these Western garments, depicted with detailed embroidery, bear certain characteristic Chinese motifs: one man has a dragon design on his doublet, while another’s costume shows a typically Asian auspicious motif of intersecting diamonds within a diagonal lattice. In addition, the men’s features—including wispy mustaches and beards—have an Asian character. While the embroiderer may have intended to represent Portuguese gentlemen, there is a certain mixing of imagery and types here that is seen in other decorative arts of the period that depict foreigners, such as the painted Japanese Namban screens showing the ""barbarians"" arriving in Japan.²The basic design of the coverlet, which at some point was lined in a vibrant clamp resist-dyed silk from India (MMA 1975.208a-c), consists of a central roundel in a field surrounded by one or more borders; although this layout is frequently seen in works made for export, it also appears in domestic Chinese kang (daybed) covers.³ Its imagery—including dragons flanking a flaming jewel, the birds and flowers of the border, and the Chinese-style lions in each corner—is common in Chinese textiles. Some of the details, however, are unusual, or are combined in unexpected ways, suggesting the involvement of a European trader or client unfamiliar with the selection and placement of motifs in Chinese iconography. The jewel between the dragons, for example, is uniformly surrounded by flames, resembling a Western sun more than the characteristic Asian flaming jewel. And the lotus pond at one edge of the border, which would normally be the backdrop for pairs of waterfowl, such as ducks or egrets,⁴ instead features large pheasants, more often depicted in a dry, rocky setting.

A multifruiting tree is described in the Book of Revelations; a tree that grows in the celestial City of God bearing twelve types of fruit that ripen during every month of the year. This association with the Tree of Life in Revelations is reinforced by the curling grape vine wrapped around the trunk of the tree, which is symbolic of the Passion of Christ and the promise of eternal life.The addition of numerous animals and the presence of both the sun and the moon also refer to the abundance of the Garden of Eden in the Book of Genesis.",embroidery
"Floral velvets like this one are often referred to as jardinière velvets, using the French word for garden in reference to their bold, symmetrical floral patterns, or Genoa velvets, referring to the city where they were first produced. It is difficult to date this type of velvet precisely, as it was fashionable for formal interiors over a period of many years. The same type of design-large flowers and scrolling leaves symmetrically arranged to cover the entire width of a textile-also appears in monochrome damasks of the period.Velvet is distinguished from other flat textiles by its pile weave. This texture was created by an extra warp, in addition to the warp necessary for the background of the fabric. The pile warps were passed over small rods to create the loops of the pile. A polychrome velvet required as many extra sets of warps as it had colors in the pile, in this case four colors of velvet pile on a white satin background. Jardinière velvets usually had a combination of cut and uncut loops, giving further texture to the design. In this example, the combination of cut and uncut velvet on a smooth satin surface gives it an especially rich character, as all of the surfaces reflect the light differently.",velvet
"While the Portuguese were undoubtedly the first importers and consumers of the Indian embroideries made for the western European market, at least a few examples of these textiles did appear in England by the late sixteenth century. The 1601 inventory of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury (1527—1608), included two quilts that were almost certainly products of this trade: ""a quilt of yellow India stuff embroidered with birds and beasts"" and ""a quilt of India stuff embroidered with beastes.""¹ Indian quilts of the type produced for the Portuguese market appeared with increasing frequency in London sales into the 1620s, when their value began to decline, perhaps because of diminishing novelty.²The taste for Indian-style embroidery remained, however, and it is interesting to note that the English maker of another bedcover in the Museum's collection (MMA 34.104.1) used not only the Indian palette of golden yellow on white but also an imported Indian cotton as the foundation. The cover has rare seventeenth-century marks on the plain-weave cotton fabric: the initials G.C.E. (for the English East India Company's original name, The Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies) as well as three other stamps whose significance has not yet been deciphered.³ On that bedcover, the embroidered designs draw heavily on such exotic motifs as pineapple-like vegetation and serrated leaves, but contemporary European sensibilities are also evident in the strapwork connecting the floral elements. Additionally, the three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the use of stitches with long floats that create a shinier surface to contrast with the matte appearance of the cotton ground diverge from the Indian prototypes, whose flatter chain stitches are less glossy. English bedcovers were usually part of coordinated sets that could include bolsters, pillows, and matching valances.⁴In addition to the more common monochrome yellow-on white embroideries, Indian polychrome embroideries also arrived in England during the early seventeenth century. They, too, are described in sale records; for example, a 1614 sale included ""a carpet or quilt embroidered upon calico with sundry silks.""⁵ The word ""carpet"" is probably used in its contemporaneous sense, that is, to signify decorative covers for a variety of furniture types, including beds. This textile, an English polychrome silk and metal-thread bedcover, is more obviously dependent on the stylistic composition of Persian and Turkish carpets than MMA 34.104.1.  By the eighteenth century, both embroidered and painted cotton textiles of this type, with a central medallion and smaller medallions in the corners of the central field, were being made in India for domestic consumption and for export (see e.g. Winterthur Museum no. 1963.0048 and Victoria and Albert Museum no.

"Imported Middle Eastern textiles were highly valued luxury goods during this period, and this velvet pattern was originally the product of the Persian workshops of Tabriz.

"This object is from the collection of Natalia de Shabelsky (1841-1905), a Russian noblewoman compelled to preserve what she perceived as the vanishing folk art traditions of her native country. Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments. Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.Russian bed curtains and towels were not only used for decorative purposes, but also provided an important role in ceremony. Bed curtains often adorned sleighs for weddings or carnival processions. Towels were draped over mirrors, trees, and temples, hung on walls, or used as offerings to the church in addition to their traditional uses. The variety of patterns and filling motifs in this border is outstanding. The design highlights the peacock, a sign of good fortune in many cultures.",embroidery

"In 1785 Louis XVI purchased the Château de Saint Cloud in Marie Antoinette's name from the duc d'Orléans. The château, situated on a hillside overlooking the Seine not far from Paris, became the queen's favorite summer residence. Built in the sixteenth century and rebuilt during the seventeenth, the palace was in need of renovation. The architect Richard Mique (1728–1794) enlarged and altered it, and appropriate furnishings were ordered for the queen's apartment.Many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené (1748–1803), a member of an important dynasty of Parisian chair makers who received a royal appointment in 1784. Sené provided a set of seat furniture for the queen's dressing room, called her cabinet particulier ox cabinet de toilette that is described in the 1789 inventory of Saint Cloud. The daybed (41.205.1), the bergère (a comfortable chair upholstered between the arms and the seat, 41.205.2), and the fire screen (41.205.3a, b) from the set are now in the Museum's collections. They were the gift of Ann Payne Blumenthal, the second wife of George Blumenthal. The painted and gilt frame of the low daybed is embellished with floral motifs. Six short tapering and fluted legs surmounted by Ionic capitals support the piece. The front stiles of the head- and footboard, which are of equal height, are carved with female half-figures wearing Egyptian headdresses. The bergère, which has a medallion with Marie Antoinette's initials on its top rail, is decorated in a similar manner. A decade before Napoleon's North African campaign was to inspire the fashion known as égyptomanie, the queen appears to have had a taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art. Seated classical female figures, rather than Egyptian caryatids, decorate the feet of the fire screen, and a woman who once held a cornucopia reclines on its top. The carver is not known, but Louis-François Chatard (ca. 1749–1819) was responsible for painting and gilding the frames.According to the 1789 inventory the set was originally upholstered in a white-twilled cotton with rows of individual flowers embroidered by the queen herself. When the three pieces came to the Museum in 1941 only the fire screen's show cover had survived. Although the cotton ground is much discolored, Marie Antoinette's interlaced initials, composed of blossoms embroidered in satin stitch, are in remarkably good condition.",embroidery
"Spot samplers feature motifs that are scattered in a seemingly random fashion over the surface of the foundation fabric, usually linen. These samplers are rarely signed or dated, and often include motifs that are only partially worked, leading to the conclusion that this type of sampler was made as a personal stitch reference for its maker, and not for display, as band samplers were signed by student embroiderers. The sampler features flowers, obelisks on pedestals, and an ""S"" motif, in addition to geometric designs that are of the type that would have been used to decorate small purses, cushions, and other accessories.",embroidery
"One saint wears a pallium over a chasuble, a style of dress that suggests a dating between the eleventh and the twelfth centuries. He is otherwise not vested as an ecclesiastic; the embroidery may therefore have originated outside Europe, possibly at a Coptic community in Egypt. On the other hand, the technique and the architecture, which have something in common with Carolingian art, may suggest a European origin.",embroidery
"Velvet with the pattern delineated solely by the contrast between two heights of the dense silk velvet pile was particularly popular in the sixteenth century. This pattern of lobed palmettes, sometimes incorporating crowns, was made into robes or sashes worn by the senators of the Venetian Republic. It was also used to make ecclesiastical vestments. The crimson shade is associated with the Venetian senators, but the Museum also has an example woven in deep blue silk.",velvet

"This elaborate beadwork basket is one of a group of similar surviving examples that have been compared to silver baskets of similar form that were traditionally used to hold a child’s clothes during the christening ceremony. Although such beadwork baskets clearly did not lend themselves to this kind of practical use, their imagery is also usually celebratory and commemorative of marriage or betrothal. Such is the case with this piece, which celebrates the union in 1662 of King Charles II and Catherine of Braganza. They stand in the center of the satin panel, surrounded by a profusion of fruits and flowers that is generally suggestive of fecundity, although such elements as the butterflies, a radiant sun, and an oak sapling may have been chosen for their specifically Royalist associations. In this context, the peacock at the center beneath the royal couple may be an emblem of the Restoration, as the peacock’s traditionally incorruptible body was associated with rebirth and resurrection. The four female figures who stand around the royal couple are the Four Continents, identifiable by the creatures that accompany them. Europe with a stag stands at top left, Asia with a leopard at top right. The lower register is less clear because of the interchangeability of the figures’ attributes, but nonetheless the griffin probably represents Africa and the cockatrice America (see also MMA, 39.13.2a). The placement of the royal couple at the center of the Four Continents was to situate their union within the wider compass of a divinely appointed natural order.A number of very similar beadwork baskets survive from the third quarter of the seventeenth century and share the same essential structure: a rectangular frame made from heavy gauge wire, spherical feet, and everted sides extending outward from the base, with regular intervals of wire of the same gauge forming square openings. The handles are bent in a trefoil shape and extend from the center of each of the four sides. The wire is wrapped in variegated colored patterns of beads.It has been suggested that the introduction of beadwork into English embroidery was related to a growing trade with the Far East, Africa, and the Americas. Glass beads, or ""bugles,"" were produced on a large scale in Venice and Amsterdam in the seventeenth century and shipped in quantity to ports near London, where they were destined to be traded for fine materials that were imported to Europe. Joan Edwards speculated that the use of these beads in embroidery must have developed suddenly after the 1630s when this trade first began. She posited that haberdashers, merchants, or bead traders, who often also sold wire, realized the market potential of the use of such beads in women’s embroidery. Many raised-work pictures of the period also incorporate glass beads, demonstrating an appetite for the unusual and exuberant.It is probable that baskets of this kind were made by professionals or perhaps sold as kits. Certainly, it is likely that the intricate and lifelike fruits were professionally produced. Even the king and queen are produced on a slip of canvas and were probably prefabricated. This is substantiated by a strikingly similar basket, from the Untermyer collection, now at Colonial Williamsburg, which has the same form of frame and whose applied fruits and flowers with an identically posed king and queen are worked in the same beaded pattern and colors.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery
"Formed as sprays of floral ornament, this embroidered cross from a bishop's outer stole, or omophorion, reflects the eastward spread of the Baroque style via Venice.

"During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, illustrations of biblical stories served as didactic examples of moral behavior. The life of Joseph might represent love of the family while individual episodes could be interpreted differently. The rejection of Potiphar’s wife (on the back), for instance, may signify chastity, an important female virtue.",embroidery
"By the late seventeenth century, the appeal of Far Eastern goods and motifs had reached most levels of English society. Those who could not afford a cabinet mounted with imported Asian lacquer panels or a suite of tapestries like those produced by John Vanderbank (see MMA 53.165.2) could still satisfy their taste by wearing a petticoat or other fashionable accessory decorated with exotic motifs. In 1688 John Stalker and George Parker published A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing, which includes twenty-four copperplate designs that could be used to decorate a variety of objects (see MMA 32.80.2). This book also gives detailed instructions on how to create imitation lacquer, or japanning, on various household objects. The text shows a lack of specificity regarding culture and geography that was typical of the period. For example, in their preface, the authors sing the praises of Japan and its architecture, but in the instructions the reader is advised ""that if you would exactly imitate and copie [sic] out the Japan [design for imitation lacquer]"" one should look to ""the true Indian work"" where they ""never crowd up their ground with many Figures, Houses, or Trees, but allow great space to little work.""¹There are extant English mirrors that retain their original ""Japanned"" frames, as well as American furniture decorated with motifs from works like A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing.² However, such books inspired more than just imitation lacquer on furniture. This embroidered panel and its mate are among a number of English examples from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that are stitched with similar exotic designs. A small quilt in the Metropolitan Museum and two panels in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, are all embroidered with the motifs of the woman carrying a fan with an attendant who shades her with a parasol, and tiny pavilions dwarfed by oversize foliage.³  One of the panels in Boston bears the rare signature of a professional pattern draftsman, one John Stilwell who had a shop near Covent Garden, London. Stilwell would have drawn his designs directly on fabric that was then embroidered; for inspiration he probably relied on publications such as A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing.

"Working an embroidered maps such as this sampler became part of a young girl’s education, starting in the 1770s, and continuing until about the 1840s. The map of England and Wales was so popular that printed versions were available to be stitched, which slightly reduces the potential for learning geography, while retaining the importance of practicing neat embroidery. The additional flourish of the floral garland is a charming feature. Other embroidered maps of geographical features were produced, from individual towns and counties, to the entire world in two hemispheres.",embroidery

"This casket, the largest in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection of embroidered boxes, contains a multitude of objects, from glass bottles, which were typically fitted into boxes of the period, to a large array of sewing implements and materials, including 25 paper thread winders made from folded playing cards, several ivory thread winders, a bodkin, three ivory embroidery tools, a spool of gold filé thread, a silk tassel, several loose skeins of silk thread, a silk needle case, and a piece of detached buttonhole stitch fabric. Some of the objects clearly do not match the casket’s seventeenth-century date. Thread, both dyed silk and metal varieties, was purchased by weight, and the number of objects devoted to the organization of threads speaks to the value of this material. Decorated boxes intended to store sewing implements, among other things, were known on the Continent as well as in England; several seventeenth-century Dutch cushion-shaped containers survive, and seventeenth-century genre paintings confirm their practical use as supports for sewing.The completion of a decorated casket or cabinet would have been considered the culmination of a young woman’s education in needlework skills, and a few boxes have survived that can be firmly attributed to schoolgirls. Martha Edlin’s dated embroidered objects form the most complete record we have of one person’s output in the seventeenth century (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), although professional contributions at any point in the work would certainly have been possible. The exuberance of the decoration and the rather indiscriminate combination of materials and techniques suggest that this casket is the work of an amateur. Contrast this with the cabinet illustrating scenes from the Life of Joseph (MMA, 39.13.3a-k), which was executed in a single technique (laid and couched silk) and precisely and evenly worked on all faces of the box. This casket also lacks the consistency of theme present on most cabinets; the top of the lid shows the meeting of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, whereas the side panels are apparently random combinations of motifs typical of the period: heraldic animals, a castle, and a fountain, all surrounded by oversized flora and fauna. It is possible that the embroidered panels of this casket may have been applied to the wood carcass at a date significantly later than the execution of the decoration. The carcass itself is too large for the embroidered panels; the gaps where the satin foundation fabric does not cover the wood are patched with more silk and disguised with metal bobbin lace. The color and style of the lining—green silk with a padded main compartment—differ from most other boxes of the seventeenth century as well. Another casket in the Lady Lever Art Gallery collection has a similar padded interior, but the silk lining is described as the typical salmon-pink color.Nevertheless, this casket is important for its possible association with a mirror in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection (MMA, 39.13.2a). The back of the mirror frame is marked with the initials A.P. and the date 1672, and the casket contains thread holders or winders and a metal bodkin marked with the same initials. Both of these objects were in the collection of Percival Griffiths, and early scholars assumed that they were the work of the same maker. Although the mirror frame displays a more skilled and certain command of techniques and materials, it does contain some unusual elements, such as actual shells used in the decoration of the grotto. G. Saville Seligman and Talbot Hughes mentioned ""Lady Ann Paulet, who was a very accomplished broiderer"" in association with these embroideries, possibly referring to a lady-in-waiting to Queen Mary II (1662–1694), but no other evidence exists to support this attribution. The uncertain date of the construction of the casket, along with the survival of various tools and accessories, speaks to the continued significance of embroidery in the lives of women beyond the seventeenth century.[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery

"The earliest British charity schools for poor and orphaned children were founded around the country by local gentry, to support and educate children whose families lived in the vicinity. In the eighteenth century, the number of institutions increased significantly.

"This early-18th century chasuble is adorned with 16th-century orphreys; a notable example of how these embroidered bands were treasured, preserved and reapplied to chasubles from one century to the next. The skilled workmanship depicts 4 church figures: St. Anthony of Padua, with a book as Doctor of the Church; possibly St. Leonard of Porto Maurizio, with a large cross alluding to the devotion of the Stations of the Cross, which he championed; St. Francis of Assisi, shown with stigmata, and St. Bonaventure, with a book as a Doctor of the Church, as well as a double-barred cross and the red hat of a cardinal. The figures of both Sts. Leonard and Bonaventure are cut off, which indicates that the embroidery is being re-used. It is possible that since all of the saints depicted are Franciscans, the piece may have been originally made for Franciscans.",embroidery
"""At eleven o’clock set out for the Thuilleries, to see the balloon go off; we soon quitted the coach, and it was with the greatest difficulty we got through the crowd on the Pont-royal to the little garden door. It was not long afterwards, that the Duke of Cumberland was in danger of being squeezed to death, as announced in all the public journals. The Queen of France sat in the balcony in front of the Thuilleries, appeared serious, and our party remarked, that she looked like a very handsome English woman. As soon as the aëronauts had taken their flight, I quitted the gardens.""[1] In his diary entry for December 1, 1783, Joseph Cradock (1742–1826) refers to the many spectators who watched a historic event take place that day: the first manned hydrogen balloon flight. The aeronauts Jacques-Alexandre-César Charles (1746–1823), a physicist, and his collaborator, Marie-Noël Robert (1760–1820), took off from the gardens of the Tuileries in a gondola suspended from a netted hydrogen balloon.Balloon-shaped and carved with netting, the finials of these side chairs, supplied for the queen’s boudoir at the Château des Tuileries in February 1784, celebrate Charles and Robert’s successful flight. Georges Jacob, one of the outstanding menuisiers of the ancien régime, provided the walnut frames, which he described as “of a new shape,” possibly referring to the arched top rail or the seat shaped like a horseshoe. The brothers Rousseau, who were decorative painters as well as sculptors, executed the delicate carving, each element of which is carefully detailed in their 1784 invoice. The chairs’ legs have the form of arrow-filled quivers, and the uprights of the back are shaped like fasces, or bundles of rods tied with ribbon, which symbolized power or authority in classical antiquity. The now little-known Presle, who advertised as “painter and gilder to the king,” gilded the frames. For certain details of the carving, such as the myrtle branches on the seat rails, a clear greenish tone of gilding was chosen to subtly contrast with the yellow gold used elsewhere.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010][1] Cradock 1828, vol. 2, pp. 38–39.",damask
"The scenes illustrate the biblical account of King Ahasuerus and Queen Vashti as told in the Book of Esther. Ahasuerus commanded Vashti to show her beauty to those gathered at a feast. She refused and was banished. Although this story was rarely depicted, that of Esther, Vashti's successor, was a particularly popular subject in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century embroideries. Intended for a bed, this valance was most likely part of a set showing scenes from the story of Esther. The contrasting examples of a willful and a virtuous wife lead one to conjecture that the set was a wedding gift.",embroidery
"Sumptuous velvets were among the most highly prized luxury fabrics of the Renaissance. Woven in both Spain and the Italian peninsula, they were exported throughout Europe and became as essential component of the visual ""magnificence"" with which the ruling elite demonstrated their wealth and power.

The silk velvet pile was most commonly dyed red, but blue and green examples also appeared in significant numbers.",velvet
"Like the nearby crimson example, this is a damask. Its subtle pattern was achieved by contrasting the shiny warp face with the matte weft face of the same weave, a technique that European weavers learned by studying imported Chinese silks. The motif’s midsize scale renders this design versatile enough to be used for furnishings, wall coverings, or dress fabric. This green silk damask was displayed in European Textiles and Costume Figures, on view at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences (visible at center bottom in the photograph of 1938), and at Walton High School (visible at right in the photograph of February 9, 1939).[Elizabeth Cleland, 2017]",damask

It is possible the sampler maker embroidered the letters to commemorate a sibling’s marriage. If this is the case, ""T"" would be the initial of the sibling’s first name and ""HK"" the initials of the spouse’s full name. The year 1670, stitched below ""T hearts H,"" is either the year in which the maker completed her work or the year her sibling got married.",embroidery
"A symbol of exoticism and power, the Asian elephant (identified by its small ears) shares the visual space of this finely patterned silk satin damask with a European double-headed crowned eagle beneath a stylized, oval-shaped lotus.¹ The elephant is shown with multiple tusks, three on one side and one peeking out on the other. As such, the animal seen here likely represents the Buddhist six-tusked elephant described in a fifth-century Chinese translation of a sutra as being resplendent and white and having lotuses, jade maidens, and other symbolic figures at the end of each tusk.²Elephants have a long history in China. Given as tribute to the emperor by local rulers, particularly from neighboring Southeast Asian regions where they were raised, elephants were also presented as diplomatic gifts to important foreign kings. Apart from their use as work animals and army transport, they were sometimes tamed to provide entertainment in times of leisure, beloved by the royal courts. In sixteenth-century Europe, elephants held a similar fascination for royals and commoners alike, and they appear in the works of such artists as Durer and Raphael. Shipped by boat from Ceylon to Lisbon, elephants were offered as gifts of the Portuguese kings to the courts of Spain, Austria, France, and England. In 1514, Manuel I of Portugal gave a white elephant (the famous ""Hanno"" known through Raphael's drawings) to Pope Leo X.  An  elephant given by the court of Lisbon to Philip II of Spain in 1581 was subsequently passed along to Henry IV of France.  A year later Henry, in turn, gve it to Queen Elizabeth of England, a brillia;nt ""re-gifting"" of an asset deemed too expensive to maintain.³ Here the combination of Buddhist symbols and Habsburg eagles produces a composite message of a religious and political nature that juxtaposes the two cultures of Asia and Europe.  We do not know how long this long-preserved length of fabric was originally used, but its delicate quality indicates that it may have been part of a garment or hanging.⁴Woven in China and likely exported through the port of Macau, this textile's blend of Asian and European taste and style was intended for a foreign market that may not have understood the Buddhist elements but nonetheless would have appreciated the fine weaving and exotic designs.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1. The textile is composed of a five-harness satin damask, with a blue warp and yellow weft. The blue color is presumably indigo, while the yellow dye was made from the Asian pagoda tree (Sophora japonica). Dye analysis was conducted by Nobuko Shibayama in the Department of Scientific Research, Metropolitan Museum, with High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Photo Diode Array (HPLC-PDA). 2. “The creature is colossal . . . and is whiter than the snows of the Himalayas. At the ends of his six tusks are six bathing tanks, in each of which grow fourteen lotuses. On each open blossom is a ‘jade maiden’ fairer than the damsels of Paradise, in whose hands are five spontaneously created lutes; each lute is accompanied by 500 other musical instruments, and 500 jewel-colored birds.” Guan Puxian pu sa xing fa jing (Sutra on the Practice of Visualizing the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra), in Soper, “Literary Evidence for Early Buddhist Art in China,” p. 223. 3.

The panel comprises two widths of cloth seamed together: identical patterns that are somewhat mismatched at the join. A fragment of the white selvage with a blue stripe is preserved along the seam in two areas (visible at the back). Digby, “Some Silks Woven under Portuguese Influence in the Far East,” pp. 55 ? 56 and n. 11, notes that several Asian damasks from Macau have a white twill selvage with a stripe and that the structure of this selvage is distinct from other silks thought to be from Macau; the elephant silk conforms to the technical features of that group. Since we have little information as to the exact provenance of these textiles, technical features such as these can be important for identifying the potential locale of their production.",damask

"The imagery of this panel is unusual in that it juxtaposes King Charles I and his consort, Henrietta Maria, with Adam and Eve beneath the Tree of Knowledge. To some extent, the panel can be classified with other commonly occurring images of the royal couple in contemporary embroidery. These appear to have been primarily celebratory or commemorative in nature, but the direct association made here between contemporary royalty and Adam and Eve is unique among surviving embroidered pictures, indeed among the images of royalty in every medium. It therefore has significance within the wider field of royal iconography of the Caroline era.The embroidery can be dated to a time after 1634, because the poses of Charles I and Henrietta Maria are derived from an engraving by Robert van Voerst first published in that year. The print shows Charles and Henrietta Maria exchanging olive and laurel branches, emblems of peace and military glory, and it celebrates their marriage and the political advantages that accrued from it. The print is a copy of the painting by Anthony van Dyck of 1632, which itself is a reworking of an original by Daniel Mytens of ca. 1630–32.This association between royal marriage and royal authority is carried over into the embroidery, although apart from the poses of the royal couple, it retains little of the symbolism of its prototype. In place of the exchange of olive and laurel branches between the royal couple, Henrietta Maria offers her husband a flower, while Charles holds a sword and scepter, the symbols of worldly dominion. The association of the royal marriage and Charles’s symbols of monarchy with Adam and Eve, the first married couple, carries the suggestion that Charles’s claim to royal authority rests on a chain of royal—specifically familial—descent stretching back to the Fall and even before that, to humankind’s state of innocence. Such a juxtaposition would have resonated in the 1630s and 1640s with the political debates that raged over the nature of political authority. In these debates, the varied justifications for political organization, whether Royalist, Parliamentarian, or Leveller, were invariably based on some understanding of Adamic patriarchy and the first marriage. For all political complexions, the concept of Paradise that had once existed in some place and time provided the key to the way in which ideal social relations once were and should still be.The theme of the panel appears to be an explicit reflection of the Royalist argument, which saw Adamic patriarchy as the basis of the divine right of kings. In The Glasse of Time (1620), Thomas Peyton described James I as ""A royall King deriued from the race, / O f Edens Monarch in her greatest grace, / Within whose face true Maiesty doth shine."" According to Richard Cumberland, a friend of Samuel Pepys, ""Humankind, and by consequence, all Societies and Families sprang from the matrimonial Union of one Man with one Woman. And, consequently, all Civil Government is originally laid out in a natural Parental Authority"" (De Legibus Naturae, 1672). Such arguments and their counter-arguments, which maintained that the right to govern derived from the consent of the people, were furiously debated during the crisis of Parliament and the Civil War years of the 1640s. John Maxwell, chaplain to Charles I, argued in Sacro-Sancta Regum Majestas (1644) that monarchy was fixed by God in the time before the Fall. ""Can we be so stupid as to acknowledge the dominion over all creatures below is given to man immediately by God, and to deny that the most noble and excellent Government by which man hath Power and Empire over men is not from God . . . but by Compact and Contract, the Composition and Constitution of men?"" Sir Robert Filmer, in his Patriarcha: or, The Natural Right of Kings (probably written about 1630, but not published until 1680), justified monarchy on hereditary grounds—that Adam and the patriarchs after him had royal authority over their children by right of fatherhood, and that this authority had been given to them by God. ""The first Father had not only simply power, but power monarchical, as he was a Father immediately from God. For by the appointment of God, as soon as Adam was created he was monarch of the world, though he had no subjects."" For Filmer, Adam’s was ""[a]s large and ample as the Absolutest Dominion of any Monarch which hath been since the Creation.""Such views reached the popular domain via sermons and pamphlets. John Evelyn recorded in a diary entry of May 1678 having heard a sermon that argued for the monarchical over all other systems of government, ""& that from Adam (to whom God had given the Empire of all things & Persons) that it seemed to be not onely of divine, but most natural institution."" And on January 30, 1694, the anniversary of the death of Charles I, Evelyn heard a young man preach on the ""Excellency of Kingly Government above all other, deriving it from Adam, The Patriarchs, God himselfe."" The panel therefore shows an embroiderer directly engaged in these debates, asserting sympathy for the Royalist cause. As such, it shows the expressive freedom of the embroidery medium, which because of its relatively private nature allowed its makers to react personally to events and to create images encompassing themes that lay outside and beyond the iconographical norms of public art, both popular prints and the more exclusive iconography of the court.[Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery
"From the early 17th century into the early 18th century, long, narrow samplers such as this one were typical.

"The Annunciation was a favored subject for epimanikia, since it lent itself to division across the pair of cuffs (see also 41.100.235). The motif of the angel Gabriel entering on a raft of clouds is borrowed from the art of Western Europe, likely via prints. The inscription in the lower margins recalls the ""toil and pains"" of the embroider and concludes with the Greek numerals ΑΨΜ for the year 1740.",embroidery

Beautifully constructed, their fine detailing includes applied metallic cord at the hem and piping at neck and waist. The bodice would have been accompanied by a skirt, which is now lost.",embroidery
"Part of a larger set, this remarkable corner settee and its pair, also in the Museum, were commissioned by one of the most powerful figures in eighteenth-century Franconia, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim (1708–1779). Prince-bishop of Würzburg and, after 1757, also of Bamberg, Seinsheim divided his time between two official residences in those cities and his three summer castles, Veitschöchheim, Werneck, and Seehof.[1] Preferring the country to the city, Seinsheim spent about three months a year outside Bamberg, at Seehof, where he enjoyed walking and hunting. He was fond of gardens and did much to embellish the late-seventeenth-century castle and especially its park, where he ordered that a maze, a theater, and a cascade with grotto and trelliswork arcades be constructed.In 1761 he also resumed work on one of the ancillary buildings at Seehof, the Franckenstein Schlösschen. This garden pavilion at the east end of the orangery and greenhouses had been conceived as a place where the prince could retreat from the strict etiquette at his court. Built by the architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel (1703–1769) for one of Seinsheim's predecessors, Johann Philipp Anton von Franckenstein, prince-bishop from 1746 to 1753, the Schlösschen had been left unfinished at the time of Franckenstein's death. Contemporary records indicate that Seinsheim decided to have its two main rooms, the Saal and the Audience Chamber (also called the Arbor Room, or berceau), embellished with frescoes and stuccowork. All four walls of the Audience Chamber were to be decorated as an illusionary arbor with trelliswork and floral festoons. Franz Anton Ermeltraut, court painter at Würzburg, was commissioned to execute a small trompe l'oeil ceiling fresco. It is not known when this was finished because the work was delayed by occasional disputes between the patron and the painter and the latter's frequent illnesses.[2] No description of the room's interior was made when the Franckenstein Pavilion was demolished in the nineteenth century, but a drawing thought to be Ermeltraut's design for the Arbor Room has been preserved, illustrating its intended decoration.[3] Also, an inventory of 1774 at Schloss Seehof mentions a ""Grünes Perceau-zimmer,"" or Green Trelliswork Room, in the garden pavilion, showing that the room had been completed by then as planned.Among the furnishings listed were the two settees, together with a pair of matching armchairs and four side chairs that are also in the Museum's collection.[5] In addition, there were four wall brackets hanging in niches, two of which have been preserved as well.[6] These furnishings were described as ""von bildhauer Arbeith grün Lassirt,"" or carved and glazed green.Both the settees and the matching chairs have serpentine gilded frames consisting of large scrolls of various shapes and openwork aprons decorated with polychrome flowers and foliage. They are supported on slightly curved legs carved with a pattern of reeds, and rest on bun feet that are partly covered by foliage. Most unusual is the off-white studded latticework intertwined with gilded and painted foliage on the inner backs of the seats; this must have been in total harmony with the original setting of the furniture. The outer backs of the settees and armchairs were left unfinished, as they were intended to stand against the wall; the side chairs, however, have latticework carving on both sides and were meant to be seen in the round. Corresponding to the inventory description of 1774, traces of a green glaze, originally applied over the gilding, are still present on the furniture.[7] Subsequent inventories offer additional details about the pieces, mentioning their green silk-velvet seat cushions and their placement.[8] Being rather top-heavy and unsteady, the settees stood in two corners of the room and the armchairs are described as being fastened in the other two. Grooves in the outer backs of the settees seem to imply that they too were once secured to the walls of the room.It is, unfortunately, not known who was the maker of this unique garden-room furniture so expressive of the exuberant Rococo taste. Its sculptural silhouette and elaborate carving, the choice of linden wood, and the unusual construction and simple joinery all make it seem likely that a sculptor or master carver rather than a cabinetmaker was responsible for the set.[9] It has been suggested that Margravine Sophie Caroline von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1737–1817), of neighboring Bayreuth, presented the suite to Seinsheim.[10] This would explain the absence of bills in Seehof's archival records. The margravine is known to have visited Seinsheim regularly, and pieces of furniture were occasionally exchanged between them. Also in favor of a Bayreuth provenance is the florid style of the pieces: Rococo furniture of Bayreuth was characterized by unrestricted use of naturalistic motifs, such as flowers, foliage, reeds, and birds. There was also a preference in Bayreuth for naturalism in interiors. Several rooms in the more recent of Bayreuth's two castles, the Neues Schloss, were decorated before 1760 in imitation of latticework pavilions, the first examples of their kind in Germany.[11] A complete set of furniture would have been an unusually large gift, however. Since the Museum's suite was in such perfect harmony with its original setting, and given Seinsheim's attention to the smallest details of Seehof's embellishments, it seems more likely that the prince-bishop ordered it himself. With the exception of a corner settee in the Würzburg Residenz, no other pieces known today bear even the slightest resemblance to the Seehof set.[12] For this reason, and in the absence of contemporary documents, it is impossible to attribute the furniture to a specific artist.The settees, chairs, and wall brackets presumably remained in the Franckenstein Pavilion until it was pulled down, between 1867 and 1870, and were then transferred to the castle itself. Seehof, which was in the possession of the bishopric and then part of the Bavarian royal domain until 1842, had become the private property of Freiherr Friedrich von Zandt and his descendants. Photographs taken at the turn of the century and later show the furniture in the Zandt family dining room.[13] They indicate that large carved flowers, now missing, originally adorned the cresting of the frames. The castle survived World War II intact, but the interior furnishings were sold off after the death in 1951 of the last male heir of the Zandt family.[14] In 1956 the Munich antiques dealer Fischer-Böhler sold this exceptional seat furniture to the New York collector Emma A. Sheafer. At that time the chairs and settees were upholstered in eighteenth-century painted Chinese silk, and only the trelliswork carving on the outer backs of the side chairs was left uncovered. Mrs. Sheafer never knew the full splendor of the furniture that filled the dining room of her New York City apartment. It was with their painted silk show covers that the furniture came to the Museum as part of her bequest in 1973. Once the fabric had been taken off, a conservation campaign was undertaken. This included the reconstruction of the foliage around the inner edge of the frames, which had been cut away to accommodate the upholstery; the removal of later paint layers on the trelliswork; and the manufacture of seat cushions covered in velvet to match the originals.[15][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide 2006]Footnotes:[1] Much of the information in this entry is taken from Kisluk-Grosheide 1990.

They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, pp. 171–72.[8] See the inventories of 1802, room 57B, and 1817–18, p. 37, no. 2A, transcripts of which are kept in the archives at Schloss Seehof.[9] Linden wood was more often used for sculpture than for furniture during this period. Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, p. 169.[10] This was suggested by the Munich dealer Fischer-Böhler.[11] Kisluk-Grosheide 1990, pp. 156–57, fig. 23.[12] Heinrich Kreisel attributed the Würzburg settee to Johann Köhler, an otherwise unknown sculptor, who was paid for ""sculptural work [and/or] carving executed in the newly furnished chamber in the princely residence""; Kreisel 1930, pp. 29–30.

"Band samplers are composed of horizontal rows (""bands"") of embroidered patterns stitched along the woven linen foundation fabric. The shape of this band sampler is unusual, as it is square rather than rectangular, long to ensure that many bands can be stitched. Many of the patterns stitched onto band samplers can be traced to sixteenth-century pattern books, and often include depictions of fruit, flowers, and geometric patterns. This undated and unsigned sampler consists of three bands, the last of which includes ""boxers,"" male figures who flank a floral motif and hold a ""trophy,"" in this case a bird.

The complex and expensive weave structure incorporates pile-on-pile weaving, as well as gold metallic loops within the velvet that add extra glitter and shading. The three-dimensional surface is achieved through the use of different lengths of pile. The figures have been identified as a youthful St. John the Evangelist, holding the cup of poison that did not harm him; St. Andrew, with the book and X-shaped cross with which he is associated; a bearded St. Paul, holding a book and a sword; St. Thomas, holding a book and a carpenter's angle; and, possibly, St. Philip, holding a book and a staff with a red cross on one end.",embroidery

"Representing spring and summer, fire and air, these hangings (MMA 46.43.1-.4) were part of a larger set that must also have included the two missing seasons and elements. This series included portraits of Louis XIV, his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, marquise de Montespan (1641 – 1707 ), and six of their children, all shown as deities. The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers. The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds. Various birds, insects, and wind instruments are rendered around this medallion, while a sunburst is shown above and Juno with peacock below. The closeness of the depiction of Louis XIV to an image of the king painted on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles by Charles Le Brun in 1683 – 84 makes it likely that the designs for the main figures in the set of hangings were supplied by his workshop; however, they may be the work of the painter François Bonnemer (1638 – 1689 ), who is known to have made cartoons after compositions by Le Brun. In 1685 Bonnemer provided designs for the embroidered seat covers of the benches and stools in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alentours, or decorative borders, full of delightful details, are believed to be by Jean Lemoyen le Lorrain, an artist little known today who worked in the circle of Le Brun.The other embroideries are thought to depict three of Montespan’s children with the king: Louise-Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes (1673 – 1743 ), with flowers symbolizing Flora, or spring (MMA 46.43.1); Françoise-Marie, Mademoiselle de Blois (1677 – 1749 ), with wheat ears, as Ceres, or summer (MMA 46.43.2); and Louis-Auguste, duc de Maine (1670 – 1736 ), in armor, as Mars, or fire (MMA 46.43.3).The compositions of the seasons include floral wreaths with the zodiac symbols for the appropriate months, while salamanders, torches, smoking braziers, and censers pertain to the element fire. The background of these rare surviving embroideries is worked in metal thread, now tarnished, which must have given them a sumptuous and shimmering appearance when they were first made. The hangings were documented in 1718 as in the collection of Louis-Alexandre, comte de Toulouse (1678 – 1737 ), the youngest child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, at the Château de Rambouillet. During the nineteenth century they belonged to King Louis-Philippe and were hung at the Palais Royal, Paris.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, adapted from The Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts/Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide and Jeffrey Munger; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010]",embroidery

"The practice of embroidery was central to the textile production of the the Arts and Crafts movement; the fact that creator and maker were more often one in the same made this an appropriate medium for the expression of William Morris’ ideals. His daughter Mary, known as May, proved to be a skilled designer of embroidery and a skilled needleworker, and ran the Morris & Co. embroidery department from 1885 to 1896. While designs for this embroidered bedcover and the related valance have not been located, the attribution to May Morris is based in its similarity to several of her known works from the 1890s. The embroidery stitches employed- darning and running stitches- are technically very simple, but the skill with which they are executed and the harmonious use of color suggest the work of a professional in the workshop of Morris & Co.",embroidery
"This luxurious, unmatched glove features a complex design embroidered in silver, gilded silver, and colored silks. The wide, tabbed gauntlets—edged with metallic lace and sequins—depict a hatted man, accompanied by a small dog, kneeling and aiming his gun at a deer. Teeming with natural elements, the other tabs present a serpent shimmying up a stalk, crenelated buildings, cattails, and sea-monsters undulating from below. These natural and supernatural symbols were popular embellishments for housewares, costume, and accessories, as can be seen in a portrait of Ellen Maurice (2017.249), where she holds a glove richly embroidered with gold serpents. This arrangement of symbols may suggest protection from something uncertain. The serpent was understood as a sign of wisdom or prudence—and sea monsters could emblemize danger or the unknown. It is, however, difficult to determine the precise meaning of the scene; the embroidery could represent a personal device or a shared memory with a thoughtful gift-giver. -Sarah Bochicchio, 2020",embroidery
"Sumptuous velvets, such as this example, were among the most highly prized luxury fabrics of the Renaissance. Utilizing variations on a relatively small number of decorative motifs, most notably the pomegranate, palmette, artichoke, and garland, these silken-pile textiles developed from earlier fifteenth-century subtle voided patterns, formed by the appearance of the ground fabric where there was no pile on the surface, into visually and technically more complex designs. Here, the symmetrical pattern of elaborate artichoke forms within lobed compartments surrounded by ogivally arranged intertwined leaves and flowers is woven with metal thread, and some details are executed with metal loops (bouclé) for additional texture. The jewel-tone silk velvet primarily forms the background, which, in areas, has a subtle ""sculpted"" leaf pattern achieved by juxtaposing two different heights of the velvet pile.Woven in Italy—particularly Florence, Venice, and Genoa—and in Spain, velvets were coveted throughout Europe and also in Turkey, where production demonstrated reciprocal influences, especially with Venetian weavings. This particular example exhibits Eastern influence in the crenate collar or clip motif that secures the garlands. Contemporary paintings, inventories, and extant examples clearly indicate the international appeal of velvets and their varied uses: from ecclesiastical vestments to caftans and European-style garments for the very wealthy, to opulent furnishings, cloths of honor, and diplomatic gifts.",velvet

"The settees and chairs illustrated here (see 1974.356.114–.121) were made for the Franckenstein Pavilion in the gardens of Seehof Castle near Bamberg, one of the three summer residences in Southern Germany used by Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, prince bishop of Würzberg and Bamberg. A true garden enthusiast, it was under von Seinsheim that the gardens of Seehof were embellished, which must have resembled the still extant Rococo gardens completed by von Seinsheim at Veitshöchheim. His love for gardens and garden imagery also carried over into the interior decoration and furnishings of his castles, as the Seehof furniture demonstrates. A unique example of German Rococo furniture executed in a more flamboyant style than its French prototypes, the ensemble was designed specifically for the Garden Room in the Franckenstein Pavilion. Used as an audience room, it was referred to as the ""Green Trellis Chamber"" in the 1774 Seehof inventory and painted entirely with trompe l'oeil trellis and foliage. The garden room's furniture was made to match: the backs of the chairs and settees are richly carved in the form of garden trellis-work with colored flowers and foliage.",velvet
"A fine example of English amateur embroidery of the late 1600s, this work bag bears the initials of the young needleworker who made it, who also added the date 1669, and her age, ten. The bag, which would have been used to store embroidery implements and supplies, is decorated on both front and back with red wool thread, primarily in a double running stitch, on a linen foundation.Embroidery was an essential component of female education in England in the seventeenth century; students generally completed at least one sampler displaying a variety of techniques and designs. By the mid-seventeenth century the repeating border designs worked on samplers had become anachronistic in the contemporary design vocabulary, having been derived from sixteenth-century pattern books produced on the Continent and adapted by English publishers. To find an old-fashioned border design on a practical object like this work bag is unusual. Yet the detached motifs in the carefully organized yet lively design - human figures; native plants and flowers, including strawberries, acorns and honeysuckle; heraldic animals such as lions, leopards, and stags; and more prosaic creatures such as birds and caterpillars - are typical of those found on English embroidered textiles throughout this era.",embroidery
"This tablecloth closely follows a tapestry set, known as the Loves of Gombaut and Macée, to represent the carefree, sexually enlivened lives of the shepherds Gombaut and Macée. Its border illustrates incidents taken from the first six tapestries of the set, embroidered in tent stitch using wool and silk in brilliant red, pink, blue, and dark blue-green colors. The tablecloth is also based on a set of eight woodcuts by John Le Clerc, made about 1587, which are thought to have been copied from the tapestry series. The widespread popularity of the story is apparent from the number of its depictions that have survived.The scenes shown extol the ideal pleasures of Arcadian life. Macée washes her feet in a stream and later raids a bird's nest with Gombaut in a scene taken from the first tapestry. Then they play tiquet, a game similar to croquet, and a man smacks a girl. A bagpipe player performs, the two shepherds dance, and they feast on biscuits, water, and strawberries in scenes taken from the third and fourth tapestries. Finally, Gombaut is betrothed to Macée and marries her in scenes from the fifth and sixth tapestries. Several scenes found in the tapestries are omitted in the embroidery, including the shepherds as children chasing butterflies and the onslaught of wolves that causes Gombaut's unfortunate death and concludes the story. Gombaut's later life is rarely shown in illustrations of the story; the sad approach of death is not in keeping with the idyllic pastoral theme. The harsh realities of peasant life were rarely acknowledged before the nineteenth century. The explanatory French verses, in the late fifteenth-century style, found on the tapestries and also on the woodcut prints are also absent from this tablecloth.",embroidery
"This long and narrow sampler is divided up into five square sections, two small and three large, on top of which is an alphabet. Four of the squares consist of floral motifs along the borders and facing the middle, while the fifth features banded geometric patterns. The letters SM and the year 1651 are stitched onto the linen, most likely the initials of the maker and the year in which she completed her work. Flanking these initials are a ship’s wheel and an unidentified animal.",embroidery
"This deep red satin chasuble was embroidered in China. Its slender, A-line shape was common in chasubles of eighteenth-century Spain, where it may have been used.¹ The focal point of the embroidered design is the roundel with a double-headed eagle at the center of the vestment’s front and back. Although the double-headed eagle surmounted by a crown was a symbol of the Habsburg monarchy, here it is purely decorative and tinged with an auspicious Chinese flavor.² Instead of grasping arrows in their talons, as they would in the Habsburg motif, the birds dangle flowering and leafy stems from their beaks. In Chinese textiles auspicious birds frequently hold symbolic flora: a rank badge in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection features a crane that grips a branch bearing both a peach and a peach blossom.³ The front and back of the chasuble are each divided into three vertical sections, separated by narrow embroidered floral trim that also borders the neck and edges.⁴ The central section consists of a series of vertically aligned roundels, floral rosettes, and geometrically decorated vessels resting on stands amid a simple ogival pattern of flowering vines. On each of the two side sections, a graceful design of delicately curving leafy stems emerges from a multicolored cornucopia, a long-standing European motif. Cornucopias are included in at least two other eighteenth-century chasubles embroidered in China, one now in the Metropolitan and the other in the Museo Nacional del Virreinato, Tepotzotlan, Mexico, and formerly in the Catedral de Mexico—a reminder that there were markets besides Europe for chasubles embroidered in China.⁵ The scrolling pattern of the side panels is punctuated with large flowers, some of which include elements from Chinese decorative arts and others that are unusual from a Chinese perspective—even quite fantastic. The large flowers close to the cornucopias on the front of the garment and flanking the eagle roundel on the back are rather unrefined in technique, featuring dots on their radiating petals and a bold red, white, yellow, and blue coloration that lacks the more subtle shades of light red seen in the smaller flowers nearby, a customary coloration in Chinese embroidery. As dotted petals are fairly common in Indian floral textiles of the eighteenth century but unusual in Chinese examples, these bold flowers and other similarly distinctive blooms may reflect the Chinese embroiderer’s attempt to mimic the Indian floral patterns that were so popular in international trade.

"This object is from the collection of Natalia de Shabelsky (1841-1905), a Russian noblewoman compelled to preserve what she perceived as the vanishing folk art traditions of her native country. Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments.

The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers.

"In 1785 Louis XVI purchased the Château de Saint Cloud (fig. 49) in Marie Antoinette's name from the duc d'Orléans. The château, situated on a hillside overlooking the Seine not far from Paris, became the queen's favorite summer residence. Built in the sixteenth century and rebuilt during the seventeenth, the palacewas in need of renovation. The architect Richard Mique (1728-1794) enlarged and altered it, and appropriate furnishings were ordered for the queen's apartment.Many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sene (1748-1803), a member of an important dynasty of Parisian chair makers who received a royal appointment in 1784. Sene provided a set of seat furniture for the queen's dressing room, called her cabinet particulier ox cabinet de toilette that is described in the 1789 inventory of Saint Cloud. The daybed, the bergère (a comfortable chair upholstered between the arms and the seat), and the fire screen from the set are now in the Museum's collections (figs. 50?57). They were the gift of Ann Payne Blumenthal, the second wife of George Blumenthal. The painted and gilt frame of the low daybed (fig. 50) is embellished with floral motifs. Six short tapering and fluted legs surmounted by Ionic capitals support the piece. The front stiles of the head- and footboard, which are of equal height, are carved with female half-figures wearing Egyptian headdresses (fig. 51). The berg?re (fig. 52), which has a medallion with Marie Antoinette's initials on its top rail (fig. 53), is decorated in a similar manner. A decade before Napoleon's North African campaign was to inspire the fashion known as égyptomanie, the queen appears to have had a taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art. Seated classical female figures, rather than Egyptian caryatids, decorate the feet of the fire screen (figs. 54, 55), and a woman who once held a cornucopia reclines on its top. The carver is not known, but Louis-François Chatard (ca. 1749-1819) was responsible for painting and gilding the frames.According to the 1789 inventory the set was originally upholstered in a white-twilledcotton with rows of individual flowers embroidered by the queen herself. When the three pieces came to the Museum in 1941 only the fire screen's show cover (fig. 56)had survived. Although the cotton ground is much discolored, Marie Antoinette'sinterlaced initials, composed of blossoms embroidered in satin stitch, are in remarkably good condition (see fig. 57).",embroidery

"This pair of embroidered curtains with chinoiserie designs would have decorated the sides of a European state bed of the late seventeenth to early eighteenth century. Originally, these curtains may have been part of a larger suite of furnishings for the decoration of an entire bedroom–a canape (settee) now in the private rooms of Madame de Maintenon at Fontainebleau has very similar embroidered designs.¹ The complete set of bed hangings probably included matching upper valances for the tester, lower valances for the frame supporting the mattresses, and a coordinating bedcover and headcloth, like the set of French bedroom furnishings now in the Metropolitan Museum (see MMA 53.2.1a-d, .2a-d). Oversize fanciful flora, a design element familiar from the so-called bizarre silks, are joined in these curtains by human figures dressed in vaguely Chinese garments, imaginary Asian winged dragons, and pairs of long-tailed birds. Early chinoiseriestyle furnishings, made in sturdy tent and cross stitches on canvas, were used over a wide geographic area in northern Europe during the first half of the eighteenth century, and a good number have survived.² The Metropolitan’s side curtains, with their yellow background, are most likely French, as extant examples of the yellow or pale backgrounds are associated with production or use in France. To date, no documentation regarding the commission or production for these various suites of furnishings has been discovered, though we know that another such group was probably ordered from Paris in 1721 for Favorite Palace in Ludwigsburg, Germany, the summer residence of Sybilla Augusta, margravine of Baden-Baden (1675–1733).³ Most of these embroideries, however, were worked on a dark background, either blue or black, and are therefore more closely connected with the aesthetic of English tapestries from the likes of John Vanderbank, with their reference to the dark backgrounds of Asian lacquer screens (see MMA 53.165.2). No design drawings or sources have been identified for these embroideries, which, like the Vanderbank tapestries, are decorative pastiches probably taking inspiration from the same variety of sources employed by contemporary tapestry designers, including imported fabrics and their European counterparts, the bizarre silks.⁴ A feature of Chinese art that confounded and intrigued European observers is very much present in these embroideries. Writers from the late seventeenth and well into the eighteenth century remarked on the asymmetry that was prevalent in Chinese design and architecture, as opposed to the preference for symmetry and pleasing proportion in Western taste.⁵ These early chinoiserie embroideries embody the attempt to capture the beautiful disorder"" that Europeans found so irresistible.

The composition of this sumptuous ""pomegranate"" velvet may have been influenced by textiles from the nearby Ottoman empire; it is characteristic of Turkish textiles of the period as well.

The figure of the boxer is derived from the motif of a lover offering a flower to his beloved, which is found in a number of sixteenth-century pattern books.Included on the sampler is the name Esther French and the year 1684, presumably the name of the maker and the year in which she completed her work. She may have been Esther French (sometimes written as ""Hester"") of Warminster, Wiltshire, England, who was born on November 25, 1670. This would make her thirteen or fourteen years old when she completed her sampler.

"Patterns of scrolling vines, or rinceaux, with flowers, birds, and insects - like the design on this coif, or cap – were extremely popular in England in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. By the 1580s portraits of Queen Elizabeth I and several of her courtiers show the sitters wearing embroidered sleeves decorated with an early version of this pattern in monochrome thread (usually black) on white linen.¹  Examples like this coif, made of linen embroidered with polychrome silk and metal threads, were first produced about 1600. This popular scrolling pattern appeared on both men’s and women’s headgear, women’s jackets, and furnishing textiles. The design, which may derive from similar motifs found in Islamic Spain, remained fashionable in England at least until the 1620s.² Features like the small diaper patterns used to fill the interiors of individual leaves and flower petals in blackwork embroidery and the striped or shaded leaves and petals like those seen here continued to be employed in English crewel embroidery of the later seventeenth century. These features are also found in some of the earlier surviving Indian chintz patterns produced for export to Europe. English embroidery patterns and Continental verdure tapestries were sources that contributed to the creation of the lush floral designs seen in late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Indian chintz.³ A miniature version of a scrolling floral pattern appears in one of the earliest surviving Indian chintzes, found on the walls of the circa 1677 dollhouse of Petronella Dunois (1650–1695), now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (no. BK-14656)⁴  A sarasa for the Japanese market (see MMA 2010.55), another type of Indian cotton, also displays this type of pattern, and a much larger-scale variation that includes exotic animals appears on an Indian embroidered bedcover (see MMA 68.61).A number of ornament prints, such as the German artist Bernhard Zan’s design of 1581 (see MMA 20.8.1), could have served as models for European embroideries. Like the rinceaux design itself, ornament prints often had extended periods of use and were circulated and copied long after their original invention. While there is to date no concrete evidence that designs or textiles of this exact type were sent to Indian craftsmen to copy, the practice of sending patterns to India is well documented, and it seems likely that versions of such successful patterns as the European rinceaux with flowers influenced Indian textile production for the international market.

"This elaborate quarto-size bookbinding is the work of a professional embroiderer and contains a rich variety of materials applied with a series of complex and imaginative techniques. The composition of the cover and matching back is dominated by a central royal blazon of the Stuart monarchy quartered with the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The arms are surmounted by the royal crown and supported by a lion and unicorn engaging the shield with the Order of the Garter with its motto: ""Honi Soit Qvi Mal Y Pense"" in silver filé. The royal arms are surrounded by a voluted cartouche accentuated by fronds of tightly packed silver purl, couched down closely onto the green satin ground and headed by a scroll with the inscription ""Gloria Deo."" Flanking this central cartouche are two unidentified badges bearing a crossed silver key and what appears to be a staff, each within a wreath of satin-stitch laurel leaves and silver bells. Beneath and above these is a finely worked voluted interlace of couched silver cording, from which all the foliage, flowers, and heavily fruit-laden festoons hang in thick profusion.The front cover’s degraded condition helps to identify the array of techniques. A surviving coil of couched silver purls on the lower right volute beneath the royal arms suggests that the entire interlace was once filled with such couched silver purls. This is confirmed by the remnants of stitch holes that once held them to the satin surface. In addition, some missing leaves on the festoon reveal how several detached buttonhole leaves were raised by small tufts of wool felt, still present in the spaces of the festoon’s missing leaves. The various fruits are made vivid by a mixture of pink, blue, red, and yellow silk threads blended expertly in long-and-short-stitch silk thread over padding that follows closely the shape of the gourds, apples or peaches, and pomegranates. The grapes are rendered in a variety of stitches, including couched silver purl in the form of grape clusters loosely stitched over with yellow and pink silk floss. The effect is a silvery pink-yellow variegation that mimics the frosty skin of actual grapes. Ink marks of the original design are still visible in places.The royal coat of arms had been associated with the English Bible since the break with Rome in 1534, when Henry VIII proclaimed himself the ""Supreme Head on Earth"" of the Church of England. Thereafter, the royal coat of arms became emblematic not just of the king’s temporal authority, but his spiritual authority as well. The Tudor, and later the Stuart arms, would be emblazoned over the printed Bible and other investitures of ceremony of the English church, examples of which can be found in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The cover encloses three books bound together: the Geneva version of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer, printed in 1612 and 1616, respectively, by the London printer Robert Barker, as well as a Book of Psalms, printed by the Company of Stationers in London in 1624, a date that provides a terminus post quem for the binding. As David McKitterick notes, it was not uncommon for such works to be bound together in the seventeenth century, even texts of varied dates such as these. The richness of the cover suggests a ceremonial use. The prominent imprese on the cover, possibly relating to insignias of office, may also imply a more official usage. Yvonne Hackenbroch reported a ""tradition"" (though without supporting documentation) that this volume had been a gift from King James I to Sir Edward Denny, later 1st Earl of Norwich. Although in 1870 Isaac d’Israeli recorded an 18th-century report of a gift of gloves from King James I to Denny, this provenance cannot be confirmed from the imprese, which show no likeness to Edward Denny’s coat of arms and have yet to be identified. It may also be reasonably supposed that James would confer as gifts copies of his own Authorized Version of the Bible, in print since 1611, rather than the older Geneva version, as here. A surviving Master’s Crown of the Broderer’s Company, dated to the second half of the sixteenth century and illustrated in George Wingfield-Digby’s Elizabethan Embroidery (1964), is very similar in design and technique to this Bible cover. As such, the comparison brings the latter into association with an unquestionable piece of professional work of the very highest quality and shows the persistence of style and technique into the seventeenth century.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery
"Part of a larger set, this remarkable corner settee and its pair, also in the Museum, were commissioned by one of the most powerful figures in eighteenth-century Franconia, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim (1708–1779). Prince-bishop of Würzburg and, after 1757, also of Bamberg, Seinsheim divided his time between two official residences in those cities and his three summer castles, Veitschöchheim, Werneck, and Seehof.[1] Preferring the country to the city, Seinsheim spent about three months a year outside Bamberg, at Seehof, where he enjoyed walking and hunting. He was fond of gardens and did much to embellish the late-seventeenth-century castle and especially its park, where he ordered that a maze, a theater, and a cascade with grotto and trelliswork arcades be constructed.In 1761 he also resumed work on one of the ancillary buildings at Seehof, the Franckenstein Schlösschen. This garden pavilion at the east end of the orangery and greenhouses had been conceived as a place where the prince could retreat from the strict etiquette at his court. Built by the architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel (1703–1769) for one of Seinsheim's predecessors, Johann Philipp Anton von Franckenstein, prince-bishop from 1746 to 1753, the Schlösschen had been left unfinished at the time of Franckenstein's death. Contemporary records indicate that Seinsheim decided to have its two main rooms, the Saal and the Audience Chamber (also called the Arbor Room, or berceau), embellished with frescoes and stuccowork. All four walls of the Audience Chamber were to be decorated as an illusionary arbor with trelliswork and floral festoons. Franz Anton Ermeltraut, court painter at Würzburg, was commissioned to execute a small trompe l'oeil ceiling fresco. It is not known when this was finished because the work was delayed by occasional disputes between the patron and the painter and the latter's frequent illnesses.[2] No description of the room's interior was made when the Franckenstein Pavilion was demolished in the nineteenth century, but a drawing thought to be Ermeltraut's design for the Arbor Room has been preserved, illustrating its intended decoration.[3] Also, an inventory of 1774 at Schloss Seehof mentions a ""Grünes Perceau-zimmer,"" or Green Trelliswork Room, in the garden pavilion, showing that the room had been completed by then as planned.Among the furnishings listed were the two settees, together with a pair of matching armchairs and four side chairs that are also in the Museum's collection.[5] In addition, there were four wall brackets hanging in niches, two of which have been preserved as well.[6] These furnishings were described as ""von bildhauer Arbeith grün Lassirt,"" or carved and glazed green.Both the settees and the matching chairs have serpentine gilded frames consisting of large scrolls of various shapes and openwork aprons decorated with polychrome flowers and foliage. They are supported on slightly curved legs carved with a pattern of reeds, and rest on bun feet that are partly covered by foliage. Most unusual is the off-white studded latticework intertwined with gilded and painted foliage on the inner backs of the seats; this must have been in total harmony with the original setting of the furniture. The outer backs of the settees and armchairs were left unfinished, as they were intended to stand against the wall; the side chairs, however, have latticework carving on both sides and were meant to be seen in the round. Corresponding to the inventory description of 1774, traces of a green glaze, originally applied over the gilding, are still present on the furniture.[7] Subsequent inventories offer additional details about the pieces, mentioning their green silk-velvet seat cushions and their placement.[8] Being rather top-heavy and unsteady, the settees stood in two corners of the room and the armchairs are described as being fastened in the other two. Grooves in the outer backs of the settees seem to imply that they too were once secured to the walls of the room.It is, unfortunately, not known who was the maker of this unique garden-room furniture so expressive of the exuberant Rococo taste. Its sculptural silhouette and elaborate carving, the choice of linden wood, and the unusual construction and simple joinery all make it seem likely that a sculptor or master carver rather than a cabinetmaker was responsible for the set.[9] It has been suggested that Margravine Sophie Caroline von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1737–1817), of neighboring Bayreuth, presented the suite to Seinsheim.[10] This would explain the absence of bills in Seehof's archival records. The margravine is known to have visited Seinsheim regularly, and pieces of furniture were occasionally exchanged between them. Also in favor of a Bayreuth provenance is the florid style of the pieces: Rococo furniture of Bayreuth was characterized by unrestricted use of naturalistic motifs, such as flowers, foliage, reeds, and birds. There was also a preference in Bayreuth for naturalism in interiors. Several rooms in the more recent of Bayreuth's two castles, the Neues Schloss, were decorated before 1760 in imitation of latticework pavilions, the first examples of their kind in Germany.[11] A complete set of furniture would have been an unusually large gift, however. Since the Museum's suite was in such perfect harmony with its original setting, and given Seinsheim's attention to the smallest details of Seehof's embellishments, it seems more likely that the prince-bishop ordered it himself. With the exception of a corner settee in the Würzburg Residenz, no other pieces known today bear even the slightest resemblance to the Seehof set.[12] For this reason, and in the absence of contemporary documents, it is impossible to attribute the furniture to a specific artist.The settees, chairs, and wall brackets presumably remained in the Franckenstein Pavilion until it was pulled down, between 1867 and 1870, and were then transferred to the castle itself. Seehof, which was in the possession of the bishopric and then part of the Bavarian royal domain until 1842, had become the private property of Freiherr Friedrich von Zandt and his descendants. Photographs taken at the turn of the century and later show the furniture in the Zandt family dining room.[13] They indicate that large carved flowers, now missing, originally adorned the cresting of the frames. The castle survived World War II intact, but the interior furnishings were sold off after the death in 1951 of the last male heir of the Zandt family.[14] In 1956 the Munich antiques dealer Fischer-Böhler sold this exceptional seat furniture to the New York collector Emma A. Sheafer. At that time the chairs and settees were upholstered in eighteenth-century painted Chinese silk, and only the trelliswork carving on the outer backs of the side chairs was left uncovered. Mrs. Sheafer never knew the full splendor of the furniture that filled the dining room of her New York City apartment. It was with their painted silk show covers that the furniture came to the Museum as part of her bequest in 1973. Once the fabric had been taken off, a conservation campaign was undertaken. This included the reconstruction of the foliage around the inner edge of the frames, which had been cut away to accommodate the upholstery; the removal of later paint layers on the trelliswork; and the manufacture of seat cushions covered in velvet to match the originals.[15][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide 2006]Footnotes:[1] Much of the information in this entry is taken from Kisluk-Grosheide 1990.

B24, no. 756, fol. 139.[5] The accession numbers of the pair to the present settee, of the armchairs, and of the four side chairs are, respectively, 1974.356.121; 1974.356.118, .119; and 1974.356.114–.117.[6] Accession numbers 1974.356.123, .124. They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, pp. 171–72.[8] See the inventories of 1802, room 57B, and 1817–18, p. 37, no. 2A, transcripts of which are kept in the archives at Schloss Seehof.[9] Linden wood was more often used for sculpture than for furniture during this period. Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, p. 169.[10] This was suggested by the Munich dealer Fischer-Böhler.[11] Kisluk-Grosheide 1990, pp. 156–57, fig. 23.[12] Heinrich Kreisel attributed the Würzburg settee to Johann Köhler, an otherwise unknown sculptor, who was paid for ""sculptural work [and/or] carving executed in the newly furnished chamber in the princely residence""; Kreisel 1930, pp. 29–30.

"Whitework samplers typically consist of a variety of stitches and lace-making techniques, all stitched in white thread. It is thought that samplers containing whitework, cutwork, drawnwork, and lace designs were stitched only after multi-colored band samplers were finished, as whitework techniques are more difficult. However, this theory is based on a the very small number of documented seventeenth-century embroiderers who made multiple samplers. This sampler includes bands of acorns and stylized flowers, in addition to four bands of cutwork and drawnwork featuring star and geometric patterns. While many surviving English samplers include lace, cutwork, and drawnwork, few examples of seventeenth-century lace have been attributed to English manufacture.",embroidery

Enclosing a mirror, the lid of this cabinet opens to reveal a tray with writing implements.

The archangel Gabriel, at the left, greets her with the Gospel announcement of the forthcoming birth of Jesus: ""Ave Maria gratia plena dominus tecum"" (""Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee,"" Luke 1:28).This embroidery, originally part of an orphrey (a decorative band on a priestly vestment) or an altar frontal, is virtually intact.  The selvages at left and right are preserved, and the top and bottom have been trimmed only slightly.  In its present form, with the scene almost complete and its shimmering silks still remarkably vibrant, it can be appreciated in much the same way as a Netherlandish panel painting—a medium with which it shares many compositional and iconographic aspects.  The embroidery typifies the celebrated Netherlandish or ""nué"" technique, in which gold is used not only to provide glitter but also to add to the rich three-dimensional quality of the pictorial surface—an effect to which the textile medium naturally lends itself.Please note that this object is seen on a rotating basis, due to conservation requirements.",embroidery
"The earliest British charity schools for poor and orphaned children were founded around the country by local gentry, to support and educate children whose families lived in the vicinity. In the eighteenth century, the number of institutions increased significantly. Arguably the most famous of these is the Foundling Hospital in London established by Thomas Coram in 1741; the charity still exists today as the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children. Most of these small samplers were monochrome; made to be included in a book of stitching exercises.

"Improvements in English domestic glass production in the second half of the century coincided with the fashion for raised-work embroidery and resulted in the production of some of the most spectacular examples of embroidered household furnishings of the seventeenth century.The three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the creative use of materials on this example are very impressive. The tail feathers of the peacock are created from fragments of actual bird feathers, there are tiny shells and bits of coral in the grotto surrounding the fish pond, and the costumes of the courting couple include details such as real lace trimmings and seed pearls.The decoration of this mirror refers to a marital union, symbolized by the couple flanking the mirror glass, the two manor houses above them, and the figure of Harmony, in the guise of a young woman playing a lute, at the top of the mirror. The heraldic lion and leopard suggest that the owner was a loyal Royalist, as these animals appear on the royal coat of arms as well.",embroidery
"In terms of both design and technique these wall panels exemplify the highest quality furnishing textiles of the late eighteenth century. Part of a major decorative commission executed by Jean Démosthène Dugourc, they were intended to decorate the Billiard Room of the Casita del Labrador in Aranjuez, the rural pleasure palace built for King Charles IV of Spain between 1791 and 1803. The panels were woven by Camille Pernon, premier producer of luxury silks in Lyon. The central embroidered landscapes, based on paintings of the countryside surrounding Arunjuez, were probably applied after the panels were delivered to Spain.Dugourc, who was raised at Versailles, was named dessinateur du Garde-Meuble de la Couronne in 1784. From 1786 he also worked for the decoration of a number of rooms at the Casita del Labrador. These panels are a strong statement of his eclectic use of motifs, in this case taken from Raphael's decorations for the Vatican Loggia, which were in turn inspired by Roman wall paintings. These two unused panels in pristine condition convey the daring color of Dugourc's scheme in a way that the faded panels preserved in situ at Aranjuez cannot.",embroidery

"Silk-embroidered linen covers were common furnishings in Iberian households. The proportions of this example indicate that it was used over a table rather than on a bed. The floral designs—elegant Renaissance-style scrolling vines with carnations, irises, and other flowers as well as hummingbirds seeking nectar—are constructed with brilliant yellow silk embroidered on a natural linen ground (outlines in brown tannin ink, drawn for the embroiderers to follow, are still visible in some areas). The golden yellow color, a favorite in Iberia for textiles, was derived from weld, a local dyeplant that thrived in the region and was relied on for its brilliance and durability.¹ Although the contrast between the yellow silk and the ecru ground echoes that of certain Indian embroideries made in Bengal and imported into Portugal and Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (see MMA1975.4, MMA 23.203.1), the ease of the design and the variety in stitch type (including satin, chain, and stem as well as various kinds of knots and filling stitches) help identify this as a European cover. The configuration of the cover’s decorative elements constitutes a basic format that may have originated in Islamic Spain. In particular, the large central field with a series of outer borders, including a broad center border flanked, or ""protected,"" by narrower guard borders on either side, was an established style for carpets throughout the Islamic world and one that influenced other regional textile designs, notably Spanish embroidery (the demarcation of the four outer corners in this example may, however, be more Iberian than Islamic in character). This design approach, in turn, was transmitted around the world via Spanish and Portuguese colonial administration and trade, from tapestries made by Andean weavers in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Peru (see MMA 56.163) to Asian and Indian embroideries intended for the European market (see MMA 1975.208d). Given the shared heritage of Portugal and Spain, especially during the sixteenth century, when both countries were united under a single ruler, it can be difficult to differentiate the embroidery production of one from the other.² Both regions had longstanding traditions of fine textiles, from folk works to commissions made by professional guilds for the Church and royal court. This example lies somewhere in between: although the cover was intended for actual household use, its intricate style and high quality suggest that it was made for a person of means and status.

In addition to geometric designs that are of the type that would have been used to decorate small purses, cushions, and other accessories, the sampler includes ""slips,"" motifs that would have been worked in tent stitch and then cut out and appliqued onto larger pieces of work that would have been too large and unwieldy to embroider on their own.

"Working an embroidered maps such as this sampler became part of a young girl’s education, starting in the 1770s, and continuing until about the 1840s. The map of England and Wales was so popular that printed versions were available to be stitched, which slightly reduces the potential for learning geography, while retaining the importance of practicing neat embroidery. This example that had the name and the maker written on the frame, is quite late. But the polychrome embroidery on a fine wool foundation has survived in relatively good condition compared to some examples that were made on more fragile silk satin foundations. The addition of colored borders in the counties aids in distinguishing one place from another. Other embroidered maps of geographical features were produced, from individual towns and counties, to the entire world in two hemispheres.",embroidery
"During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Gujarat, in western India, supplied embroideries of the highest quality to the Mughal court; these textiles became valued commodities in Europe as soon as sea trade with that region was established. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to enter this market, but most surviving Gujarati embroideries relate to trade with England, which increased in the early seventeenth century.¹ Over the course of the seventeenth century, as the Gujarati embroiderers adjusted their output for the English market, they adopted the common motif of pink flowers detailed in yellow that bloom from dark green vines with light green or yellow veins. In the background are spotted leopards, striped deer, squirrels, birds, and other chain-stitched beasts filled with bands of color or details in contrasting hues. These elements are understood to have been culled from a variety of sources including English embroideries, examples of which must have been sent to India as models (see e.g. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, nos. 53.2202 and 53.172). But as English embroidery was itself responding to the influx of Asian textiles, incorporating and adapting many foreign motifs, the result was a mix of European, Indian, and Chinese imagery that then fed back to its original sources in a totally transformed state. This piece, consisting of several panels that have been joined and then quilted to form a bed-size coverlet, includes the motifs found on seventeenth-century coverlets but must have been made in the early eighteenth century, when an overall pattern of rinceaux enclosing flowers became more common.² However, Gujarati production is remarkable for its variety; at the same time, embroiderers were also producing patterns related to French bizarre silks and palampore designs (see e.g. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, no. 57.168).

"Textiles were rarely used as floor coverings in the late sixteenth century, except by the wealthiest individuals, but ""carpets"" of pile weaves, tapestry weaves, or embroidery were often used to decorate tables. This fragment of a large table carpet displays strapwork motifs typical of other English sixteenth-century decorative arts such as wood carving and plaster decoration, and the ripe fruits, flowers, and vegetables are varieties that often appear on embroidered objects of the period. These include Tudor roses, pomegranates, pears, squash, honeysuckle, and grapes.The somewhat awkward drawing of the armorials suggests that this was not the product of a professional workshop. The table carpet may have been an amateur or semi-professional production, perhaps made by servants and extended family members for use in their own home. However, this project was no small undertaking; when complete, the carpet might have measured as much as twelve to fifteen feet in length.",embroidery
The beautiful embroidery on this stole employs particularly delicate and refined shading. The ribbon tufts add texture to the surface and detail to the motifs. The flowers are mostly fanciful and are typical of the earlier part of the 18th century.,embroidery
"This object is from the collection of Natalia de Shabelsky (1841-1905), a Russian noblewoman compelled to preserve what she perceived as the vanishing folk art traditions of her native country. Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments. Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.This towel end is unique in that it represents an aspect of everyday life rather than mythology. Russian bed curtains and towels were not only used for decorative purposes, but also provided an important role in ceremony. Bed curtains often adorned sleighs for weddings or carnival processions. Towels were draped over mirrors, trees, and temples, hung on walls, or used as offerings to the church in addition to their traditional uses.",embroidery
"The focal point for textile furnishings in the traditional house in the Cyclades was the bed in an alcove or on a raised mezzanine. The main bed was curtained off, and it was the curtains plus cushions and bolsters that comprised the bulk of domestic fabrics. This panel is embellished with columns and rows of double-leaf and complex triangular forms once considered typical of embroidery attributed to Patmos but now thought to represent Cycladic manufacture.",embroidery
"This veil formed a boxlike cover for the chalice during portions of the liturgy. Its central image shows the young Christ blessing from within a chalice, flanked by Arabic script labeling him Jesus, the Messiah. The Greek inscription surrounding the medallion speaks of Christ’s sacrifice, while the Georgian inscriptions at the ends of the cross-arms plead for the donor, the nobleman Solomon Shavrashidze.",embroidery
"The opulence and expense of the materials and labor that went into the making of this chasuble, stole and maniple provide evidence for the importance of vestments to the religious practices of the time. Although its general condition is poor, this early-18th century example still evokes a sense of awe with its workmanship and overall beauty. The painted area within the shield at the lower back of the chasuble of a figure in flames may depict a soul or saint in purgatory or ""purgatorius ignis"" (purifying fire).",embroidery
"This volume is a compendium of the writings of King Charles I pertaining to the last years of his reign. It is divided into two parts—""matters Civil"" and ""matters Sacred""—and includes additional material gathered from his supporters about events surrounding his death. It constitutes an expanded edition of an earlier compilation, the Eikon Basilike [Image of the King]: The Poutraicture of His Sacred Maiestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings, a 1649 printing of which is bound into the second part of the volume. The Eikon Basilike purported to be a collection of the writings of Charles I that presented the major events of his life and reign from his own point of view in language that was simple, direct, and, for a monarch, unprecedentedly personal. This narrative was interspersed with the king’s favorite prayers and psalms in a style that directly echoed the Penitential Psalms of King David and thereby offered both a justification of his rule and a kind of spiritual autobiography.The Eikon Basilike was first published by Richard Royston, who was the leading Royalist publisher in London throughout the Civil War period and who was imprisoned in 1645 for issuing ""scandalous books and papers"" against the Parliament and thereafter in constant danger of further harassment at the hands of the Council of State. By his own account, Royston received orders directly from the king in October 1648 to prepare his printing press; on December 23 he was given the manuscript through an Edward Simmons, as from the king, and had it printed. Charles’s authorship has been contested from its first appearance to the present day, although it is now widely agreed (as the Royalist apologists had insisted) that the core of the book was Charles’s but that the materials were shaped into their final form by his chaplain, the Presbyterian divine John Gauden, later bishop of Exeter.From the beginning, the Eikon Basilike was a hugely popular best-seller and became the chief focus of national grief and guilt after the king’s death. The book was sold on the streets of London on January 30, 1649, the day of Charles’s execution, and went through thirty-five English editions that year. It became, in effect, a form of common property, hotly debated among Parliamentarian detractors and their Royalist opponents and prompting numerous rebuttals and counter-rebuttals, including John Milton’s furious rejoinder, Eikonoklastes, which appeared on October 6, 1649. As Elizabeth Wheeler emphasized, the Eikon Basilike had no single fixed appearance and from the first was subject to numerous additions of text and images. The work also appeared in a range of cheap to expensive editions and in different formats, from regular folio size to tiny miniature versions.The present copy of Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae is one product of this process, although Frances Madan noted that all the additional materials within were vouched for by persons who were near the king and involved in the publication process of the original Eikon Basilike. It includes a miscellany of the king’s speeches to Parliament, his ""Messages for Peace,"" and, in the second part, a selection of his prayers, the text of the Eikon Basilike, his ""papers about Church Government,"" a list of the judges who officiated at Charles’s trial in a section headed ""Severall things relating to His Majesties Death, a list of London’s mayor and city aldermen, and various speeches and epitaphs by others made after the king’s death. According to Madan, this edition was published in London by Roger Norton with the false Hague imprint of Samuel Browne, suggesting that there was an inherent danger for Royston and his London printer, Roger Norton, in publishing such materials during these years.The embroidered cover of this volume has on the front the figure of a woman holding a cornucopia, probably representing Plenty; on the back is a woman holding a palm branch, presumably Peace. Plenty and Peace were likely qualities that the owner attached to monarchical rule. Embroidered references or borrowings from the Eikon Basilike include in the Victoria and Albert Museum collection an embroidered panel after the William Marshall engraving used as the frontispiece for the 1649 version of the Eikon Basilike (inv. no. T.117-1936). The frontispiece of this volume is an engraved portrait of Charles I by Wenceslaus Hollar (MMA, 17.50.85) that is derived from the double portrait of Charles and Henrietta Maria by Anthony van Dyck.[Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",embroidery
"As its full-size domed canopy is suspended from the ceiling rather than supported on posts, this tester bed, which bears the stamp of the menuisier Georges Jacob, is a type called lit à la duchesse en impériale. Its original but now fragile hangings, woven in 1782–83 at the Beauvais tapestry manufactory after designs by Jean-Baptiste Huet (1745–1811), have been replaced by modern silk damask, except for the lining of the interior dome. French eighteenth-century beds tended to be lofty, as it was customary to pile them with three or more mattresses filled with straw, wool, horsehair, or feathers. Tobias Smollett (1721–1771) noted in 1766, “French beds are so high, that sometimes one is obliged to mount them by the help of steps.”[1]The custom of receiving visitors while reposing in a large and elegantly fitted out bed was practiced in France during the eighteenth century mostly by aristocratic women. The Museum’s imposing piece of furniture with its exquisitely carved floral decoration, the work of an unknown carver, must have formed a splendid backdrop for such official calls or congratulatory visits. In 1791 the bed is documented as standing in the large bedchamber of Guyonne-Marguerite de Durfort de Lorge, duchesse de Choiseul-Praslin (1737–1806), at her Parisian home, the Hôtel de Belle Isle. Following the turmoil of the Revolution and the political changes of the early nineteenth century, the bed was sold in Paris in 1830. It became part of the famous collections at Hamilton Palace, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the residence of Alexander Hamilton Douglas, tenth Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852), where it was placed in one of the state rooms. The duke’s grandson sold the contents of the palace, including the bed, at a highly anticipated auction that took place in 1882. Through the intermediation of several dealers, the bed was acquired in 1897 by the financier and railroad executive George J. Gould (1864–1923). His wife, the former actress Edith M. Kingdon (1864–1921), used it in her bedroom of their New York town house.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010]Footnotes:[1] Tobias George Smollett. Travels through France and Italy. London, 1766.

"The settees and chairs illustrated here (see 1974.356.114–.121) were made for the Franckenstein Pavilion in the gardens of Seehof Castle near Bamberg, one of the three summer residences in Southern Germany used by Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, prince bishop of Würzberg and Bamberg. A true garden enthusiast, it was under von Seinsheim that the gardens of Seehof were embellished, which must have resembled the still extant Rococo gardens completed by von Seinsheim at Veitshöchheim. His love for gardens and garden imagery also carried over into the interior decoration and furnishings of his castles, as the Seehof furniture demonstrates. A unique example of German Rococo furniture executed in a more flamboyant style than its French prototypes, the ensemble was designed specifically for the Garden Room in the Franckenstein Pavilion. Used as an audience room, it was referred to as the ""Green Trellis Chamber"" in the 1774 Seehof inventory and painted entirely with trompe l'oeil trellis and foliage. The garden room's furniture was made to match: the backs of the chairs and settees are richly carved in the form of garden trellis-work with colored flowers and foliage.",velvet

"This Old Testament scene was probably drawn by a local artist for the young lady of rank who worked it with unusual skill and delicacy. As was frequent, he composed the picture from a variety of sources.

"Though Jesuit priests were received at the Chinese court with great appreciation of their learning and courtesy, a misunderstanding occurred between the Pope and Emperor K’ang-his toward the end of the latter’s life.

"The practice of embroidery was central to the textile production of the the Arts and Crafts movement; the fact that creator and maker were more often one in the same made this an appropriate medium for the expression of William Morris’ ideals. His daughter Mary, known as May, proved to be a skilled designer of embroidery and a skilled needleworker, and ran the Morris & Co. embroidery department from 1885 to 1896. While designs for this embroidered bedcover and the related valance have not been located, the attribution to May Morris is based in its similarity to several of her known works from the 1890s. The embroidery stitches employed- darning and running stitches- are technically very simple, but the skill with which they are executed and the harmonious use of color suggest the work of a professional in the workshop of Morris & Co.",embroidery
"Portraits from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries are replete with minutely detailed representations of garments and accessories decorated with emblematic motifs. The gauntlets of these gloves are embroidered with motifs which also appear on other objects made in the late Elizabethan era—a disembodied eye raining pale blue and silver tears, a colorful pansy flower, and a bright green parrot with pearls on its wings. The weeping eye is related to a contemporary emblem book, Henry Peacham's Minerva Britanna, or A Garden of Heroical Devises of 1612, though this motif was known as a symbol of unrequited love well before the publication of Peacham's book.The pansy, watered by the tears of the weeping eye, was a popular flower in the Elizabethan era. It was known to be a favorite of the queen herself and the pansy continued to appear in embroidery well into the seventeenth century.Despite the present fragile and somewhat degraded condition of these gloves, they retain enough of their sumptuous embroidery to convey the luxury of the highest quality needlework of the late Tudor and early Stuart era.",embroidery
"Rare unfinished pieces of embroidery like this one can reveal much about the process of planning and executing needlework. In this case, the squares and rectangles were intended to be cut out and applied to a wooden box frame to make a small cabinet. The design was drawn on the silk foundation with ink. It is likely that some details were meant to be left unembroidered, as suggested by the painted pale pink cheeks of the woman in the blue dress and her reflection in the mirror she holds. She is a personification of one of the Five Senses (in this case, sight), and she looks at her companion, the personification of smell, who holds a flower.
