"A martial commander, richly clad in armor, stands amidst a bustling military encampment, perhaps preparing for departure, with shields, lances, chests and other rich objects piled in front of him. Despite the seeming cohesion of this composition, the design was apparently assembled from a group of existing figure patterns, recognizable from other successful narrative tapestry series designed by artists in the circle of Bernard van Orley and by Pieter Coecke van Aelst. In this instance, the narrative might be that of Iphigenia, the ill-fated daughter of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra, who was sacrificed by her father to appease the goddess Artemis and petition her to enable sailing weather for the Greek fleet waiting to embark from Aulis and invade Troy. It is possible that this tapestry was part of a different edition of the same Story of Iphigenia series, also woven in the workshop of admired, Brussels-based weaver Willem de Kempeneer, inventoried in the collection of François 1er, King of France, in the 1550s (his edition included precious metal-wrapped threads). The tapestry was previously identified in the literature as a Scene from the Old Testament on the grounds of its notable similarity to the Story of David and Bathsheba in the Musée National de la Renaissance, Ecouen.",'animal_fibre'

Here Fame reads at a lectern, surrounded by writers whose works immortalized the deeds of the ancients. Triumphant over Death, she tramples the Fates and holds an orb crowned with a cross, locating the subject in a distinctly Christian context.

"This wickedly comic tapestry belongs to a gloriously unconventional series that tells the Story of Don Quixote within a system of so-called ‘grotesque’ ornament. Exemplifying the finest of London’s tapestry weaving, made at the apex of the city’s foray into this industry in the third quarter of the seventeenth century, this piece is a truly original combination of narrative and pattern-making – elegant, imaginative, witty, with touches of burlesque. That it retains for the most part its spectacularly bright and colorful palette makes it still more desirable.Only three other surviving sets of this series are known (none of which are in public collections). Recent research has revealed that the series from which this comes is the only one that can be identified in contemporary archival documents. This was a royal purchase, bought by Charles II’s consort, Queen Catherine of Braganza, as a gift for the Portuguese nobleman, João de Mascarenhas, first Marquis of Fronteira, whose arms have now been identified on the tapestry. In acknowledgement of his loyalty during the Portuguese Restoration War against Spain, Mascarenhas had been granted the title of Marquis of Fronteira by Catherine of Braganza’s brothers, King Alfonso VI of Portugal and the Regent, Pedro, seven years earlier. Catherine’s gift to the Marquis was likely motivated by her appreciation of the part he had played in establishing the ultimate security of the House of Braganza on the Portuguese throne. This might well be the only intact piece to survive from its first ‘edition’.In terms of both provenance and its remarkable condition, this is, therefore, by far the most important tapestry known from the Story of Don Quixote in Grotesques series and it is unique amongst London-woven tapestries: for both the circumstances of its production and its subsequent journey to southern Europe.",'animal_fibre'
"The story of Jacob as depicted in this set of six tapestries (1983.73.1–.6) begins with the scene of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob (Gen. 25:29–34). Esau, the hunter, sits with his bow and quiver at his feet. He clasps hands with Jacob, his brother, who is clad in the starred robe that will identify him throughout the story. By this handshake Esau and Jacob seal their agreement, and the former accepts a bowl of food in exchange for his birthright as firstborn. The secondary scenes represent different moments in time and serve to advance the story. In the center distance Esau is shown hunting with two dogs. To the right, Rebecca, mother of Esau and Jacob, is seen cooking outside the tent, probably preparing food for Jacob to present o his father, Isaac (Gen. 27). The narrative continues to unfold in the other tapestries, which depict Rachel giving her servant Bilhah to Jacob (Gen. 30:1–4), Rachel and Bilhah with her son Dan, and Jacob making a covenant with his father-in-law",'animal_fibre'
"Whitework samplers typically consist of a variety of stitches and lace-making techniques, all stitched in white thread. Based on the small number of documented seventeenth-century embroiderers who made multiple samplers, it is thought that samplers containing whitework, cutwork, drawnwork, and lace designs were stitched only after multi-colored band samplers were finished, as whitework techniques are more difficult. While many surviving English samplers include lace, cutwork, and drawnwork, few examples of seventeenth-century lace have been attributed to English manufacture.This sampler is worked in whitework and reticella, which requires a stitcher to remove warp and weft threads from a piece of fabric before stabilizing the fabric with buttonhole stitches and creating designs based on the grid of the linen. The top of the sampler, worked in satin, eye, and line stitches, features the initials ""MD"" (presumably the initials of the maker) and an alphabet, along with geometric and stylized floral patterns of varying length. The remainder of the sampler consists of cutwork filled with reticella lace in geometric patterns.",'animal_fibre'

"While there is a long tradition of exceptional professional embroidery in England, domestic needlework attained a high point in the seventeenth century, when it was a requisite skill of accomplished young women. In addition to clothing and accessories, mirror frames, writing boxes, table covers, and pictures were decorated with embroidery. Prints served as sources for figures, flowers, and animals, which were drawn onto the fabric and given to the embroideresses. Frequently depicted themes include Old Testament stories, political subjects, allegories, and scenes of daily life. Musical Garden Party presents activities at a country house. In a formal garden, ladies perform for an appreciative male audience. By using fine-gauge canvas and silk threads, the embroideress was able to capture many fashion details such as feathered hats, lace trimming, and the floral pattern of a gown.

"Images of gardens were popular in the tapestry medium from the medieval era, where the so-called mille-fleurs (thousand flowers) (see also 2013.506) provided a decorative, and sometimes symbolic, setting for scenes of romance and play. Park and garden tapestries continued to enjoy popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly for the decoration of more intimate chambers, where they provided a pleasant contrast with the grander subject matter of tapestries used in more formal settings. The theme enjoyed new popularity with the advent of the Rococo style during the eighteenth century, and a number of highly decorative landscape and garden series were produced in French and Netherlandish workshops during the second third of the eighteenth century. Among the most notable was the series of romantic pastorals that Boucher designed for the Beauvais workshops between 1734 and 1736 (64.165.1–.8). Known as the Fetes Italiennes, and loosely inspired by the idyllic park scenes of Antoine Watteau, this series depicted handsome gentlefolk and peasants in idealized exterior settings.

"The embroidered portions of this cloth were probably once part of a large marriage bedcover made in China for export. Later, the precious bedcover was cut up, and portions were pieced together with a delicate quilted European floral silk to create the panel as it appears today.¹ Its relatively small size indicates that it may have served as a christening or bearing cloth for a child being carried to the baptismal font for christening.²  At the very center of the textile are three bands from the original coverlet, one with a roundel containing a scene of a man and a woman flanking a tree, perhaps inspired by traditional depictions of Adam and Eve. The blossoming tree grows from a large container decorated with a continuous pattern of hexagons, a Chinese design suggesting longevity, and on the tree is a bleeding heart pierced with arrows, a secular symbol referring to love and devotion in Renaissance Europe.³ The dress of the couple is generally consistent with that of late sixteenth to early seventeenth century Europe: the woman’s unstructured clothing is typical of the early seventeenth century, while the man’s hat conforms to late sixteenth-century examples.⁴ Their garments are overembroidered with repeating Chinese patterns, as if made to resemble Chinese silk damasks. The two other adjoining bands at the center of the panel were formerly one. If placed one directly above the other, they form a scene with a pair of ducks in a lotus pond. Although the lotus pond is an enduring theme in Chinese textiles, here the pattern shows a heightened emphasis on flower centers, common in Chinese export textiles, and another type of duck has been substituted for the pair of egrets or mandarin ducks more frequently found in a traditional Chinese image. Another part of the original coverlet was retained as the embroidered border of the present panel; while its sides were heavily pieced together, the ninety-degree corners were untouched in the piecing process, indicating that it served as a border in the original coverlet as well. The delicate, light peach-colored European textile chosen to surround the exotic portions of the cloth has a floral pattern typical of the last decades of the seventeenth century.⁵ The panel is fully lined in a white monochrome woven silk with a small floral pattern on a continuous fretwork background likely woven in China. Cloth of this type, termed rinzu, was exported from China to Japan in large quantities during the seventeenth century to be used as the foundation fabric of luxurious dyed and embroidered Japanese kimonos, until the Japanese started producing it themselves in the mid-Edo period, starting in the 1680s.⁶[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1.

"Both front and back covers of this richly decorated Bible have images of King David, made in vibrant long-and-short stitch within highly ornate raised cartouches embroidered in metal thread. The front cover shows King David in profile playing his lyre, illuminated by divine rays emanating from above. Yvonne Hackenbroch noted that this standing King David derived from a figure of David on the title page of a Bible published in Cambridge in 1629. Hackenbroch also found the source for the pose of the King David on the back cover, where he is posed facing outward and holding a scepter and lyre: the title page of the third volume of Gerard de Jode’s Thesaurus Novi Testamenti (Antwerp, 1585). The spine of this Bible has five registers, each with a tent-stitch flower typical of this period. The flowers from top to bottom are: tulip, cornflower, rose, pansy, and carnation/pink. The needle-worked binding contains three liturgical texts: the New Testament (in Greek), the Book of Common Prayer, and the Book of Psalms (with musical accompaniment).The image of King David, the supposed author of the Psalms, shown here illuminated by divine rays, was an appropriate and conventional image often used to adorn books of Psalms and other liturgical works; numerous examples survive, both professional and amateur. The British Library has several, including one nearly identical in style to the Metropolitan Museum’s copy. It, too, has been made with the sumptuous materials and high-quality craftsmanship of the professional embroiderer. It has the same raised cartouches with masks on both front and back covers but with different images from the life of David within each surround.The Museum’s Bible is said to have belonged to William Laud (1573–1645), who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633 and was one of Charles I’s chief ministers. This determination is based on an old (though not contemporary) inscription written in ink on the blue silk on the inside front cover: ""This book formerly belonged to Archbishop Laud."" If this is the case, then the book and its richly worked cover assume a powerful symbolic status. Laud was a pivotal and highly divisive figure in early seventeenth-century English religious and political life, primarily because of his attempts to reform the liturgy and to impose on the English church a richly ceremonial form of worship. This stemmed from a particular view of the divine presence within the physical structure of the church itself. The church was, as the Laudian Robert Skinner proclaimed in 1634 in a sermon before the king, the place where ""our Lord God most holy doth inhabit."" It was ""his proper mansion or dwelling place."" Such a notion of divine presence thus infused all objects used in worship with a spiritual aura. For the Laudian Alexander Read in 1636, all such objects were to be held as ""holy in relation to the holy use whereto it is assigned."" Even the cloth bags used to carry the communion bread into the church were special, ""since the very bringing of it into the church to that use is a taking out of the world, a promotion of it to more reverence and a next step to consecration itself."" This attitude promoted the value of beauty in ecclesiastical ornament and decoration. As the anonymous R.T. wrote in 1638, a church should properly contain ""all kinds of ornaments that might add glory and grace . . . as curious paintings, hangings, gilding, sumptuous vestments, rich gifts of money, chalices, plate."" Within its original context, therefore, the Metropolitan Museum’s richly adorned Bible would have seemed, as Lake put it, to ""glow with the beauty of holiness."" The sense of beauty in reverence extended also to ceremonial and ritual aspects of the liturgy, the rubrics for which were contained within the Book of Common Prayer. Strict adherence to the order of the liturgy was regarded as the surest means of true communion with God and indeed constituted for Laud the only legitimate form of prayer. Whether or not the Metropolitan Bible actually belonged to Laud, it nonetheless embodies the Laudian style, both in the text itself—the Book of Common Prayer, which, containing the whole liturgy, stood at the center of Laudian worship—and in the extravagant richness of its decoration, which infuses it with ""the beauty of holiness.""A sincere Protestant, Laud wished to reinstate such practices and objects into the Church of England, which he regarded as historically and theologically accurate and which predated the corruption of the Church of Rome. As the highest prelate in the land, he sought to impose practices such as bowing to the altar (which replaced the communal ""Lord’s table""), the use of incense in the performance of liturgical prayers, and the use of rich vestments in the exercise of the liturgy. Such actions, as well as his resistance to the Puritan emphasis on bibliocentric piety and preaching, alienated both hardline and moderate Puritans. The introduction of what were widely considered Catholic or popish customs provoked significant opposition. The rebellion in Scotland in July 1637—a reaction to the institution of a new form of liturgy modeled on the English Book of Common Prayer—was what forced Charles I to recall Parliament, which in turn set off a series of events leading to the Civil Wars and Laud’s own eventual execution at the hands of Parliament in 1645.[Katy Reed-Basham and Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'

"Fire screens have been used since the Middle Ages to shield those standing or seated near a fireplace from the excessive heat of the open flames and from flying sparks. Toward the end of the seventeenth century, screens of rectangular shape with a large central panel of colorful fabric or other boldly contrasting material were developed to conceal the dark opening beneath the mantel that otherwise would interrupt the ornamental dado and paneled decoration of the room.[1] The materials used for the frame of these screens ranged from wrought iron or copper to carved wood or even silver, and the panel was often decorated with scenes from the forge of Vulcan, the Roman god of fire.[2] Especially vulnerable to changing fashions and fire damage, exuberantly carved screens such as the present example have only rarely survived. The purpose of the Museum's screen is suggested by its decoration. At the top, two snake-dragons that seem to breathe fire from their gaping jaws flank the idealized head of a woman in a shell-and-acanthus cartouche. By turning their heads away from the goddesslike image they protect her complexion from damaging heat, a conceit that conjures the ideal of feminine beauty at the time.Long thought to be of French origin,[3] this screen in fact represents virtuoso Franconian Rococo carving at its sculptural best.[4] The expressive design and skillful carving suggest that it was one of several screens ordered for the lavishly furnished palace, or Residenz, in Würzburg, the cultural capital of Franconia, by Friedrich Karl von Schönborn (1674–1746). As prince-bishop of Bamberg and Würzburg, this noble prelate ruled as the spiritual head of the regional Catholic Church and as an independent prince of the Holy Roman Empire, who—in theory—held the emperor as his feudal lord. The office of prince-bishop, a political unicum of the Holy Roman Empire and some neighboring areas, was said to be based on the biblical model of Melchizedek, who is described as high priest and king in the book of Genesis.[5] Since the prince-bishops had to defend the various interests of both church and state, they needed to amass considerable political power and wield it skillfully to allay the tensions that inevitably occurred. Moreover, it was in the interest of the bishops to use their office to increase the influence of their family and to elevate it within the feudal system. None of them understood better the importance of using the visual arts to impress friends and enemies alike with the magnitude of their worldly power than Friedrich Karl von Schönborn. During his tenure, the palace at Würzburg became one of the most magnificent and splendidly appointed residences of the late Baroque period. Friedrich Karl's architect Balthasar Neumann (1687–1753) hired only the best artisans to decorate it, and Ferdinand Hundt was one of them.Hundt settled in Würzburg in 1735 and began work the following year in the west wing under the supervision of Neumann, who called him ""the best of all ornamental carvers.""[6] Closely related to the present example is Hundt's fire screen of 1736 in the Residenz, with a crest incorporating the coat of arms of Friedrich Karl. The exuberantly formed shell feet of that screen are also conceived as scrolls with a C-shaped volute emerging on either side.[7] Ornamental compositions with surging rocaille formations, cartouches, and dragon heads characterize Hundt's designs for the carved wood paneling of the audience chamber (ca. 1742).[8] A group of candlestands carved about 1744 by Hundt also relate to the Museum's fire screen in their details, although their outline is unusually restrained. Later, Hundt created fully developed snake-dragons and shell-and-acanthus cartouches for the palace at Bruchsal, built by Cardinal Damian Hugo von Schönborn (1676–1743), prince-bishop of Speyer and a brother of the Würzburg palace's patron.[9] The blue fabric now stretched on a removable panel set within the screen probably replaced a very elaborate decorative panel of silk or lamé embroidered with precious silvered or gilded metal threads.[10][Wolfram Koeppe 2006]Footnotes:[1] Henry Havard.

"Band samplers comprise neatly worked rows of patterns suitable for repeating motifs or figural motifs on the long narrow strip of linen canvas. This is the most common type of extant seventeenth-century sampler, and its standard format was established by about 1630. The foundation was generally cut from one complete width of plain-weave linen, so that the selvages are present at what becomes the top and bottom of the finished work, and the sides are hemmed. Polychrome band samplers are typical, although some band samplers combined rows of whitework, cutwork, and needle lace with the polychrome patterns (see MMA, 57.122.368). A band sampler such as this would have most likely been a task completed by a schoolgirl under the supervision of an embroidery instructor of some kind. In fact, a band sampler was usually the first piece worked by a budding embroiderer beginning at about age seven or eight. The complete embroidered works by Martha Edlin, the only extant group of a young girl’s educational work, now housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum, begins with a band sampler as her earliest accomplishment.This example, signed by Anna Bucket, introduces the band sampler into the realm of the decorative by adding an image of a courting couple at the top of the sampler. With its precise date and the name of the maker placed prominently, above the cupid who hovers between the couple, the maker may have been referring explicitly to her actual or hoped-for marriage. The couple is accompanied by a dog, symbol of fidelity in marriage, and surrounded by the heraldic unicorn and lion. The image is a miniature version of the numerous pictures of courting couples in which the man and woman stand on variegated green and yellow grass; in addition to the animals, the scene is embellished with fruiting trees, flowers, and insects completely out of scale to their human companions. This type of sampler may have been displayed in the home, as became common practice in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Contemporary evidence of this practice can be found in the criminal proceedings of the Old Bailey: in December of 1750 a man was convicted for stealing, among other things, ""one needle-work sampler, with a frame and glass.""

"Created as three separate panels, this embroidery was intended to be mounted within a hinged frame and be experienced as a triptych: opened to reveal the central Adoration of the Kings, with the Nativity of the Shepherds in the wing to the left, and the Circumcision in the wing to the right. The frame has not survived, and it is not known whether its outer wings, visible when the triptych was closed, were similarly decorated. In subject matter, iconography and design, the embroidery closely follows painted precedents: it speaks, in particular, to devices first invented by the influential Brussels-based painter Rogier van der Weyden, subsequently developed and reiterated by his successful follower, Hans Memling, who ran a large workshop in Bruges. However, the virtuoso embroiderer, or small team of highly talented embroiderers, who created this brought the prestige of their raw materials, working in richly dyed silks and precious metal threads. Whilst the subtle nuances of shade and tone in draperies and facial features were achieved by careful hatching of the silk threads in satin stitch, much of the ground, including the architecture, was executed in the or nué technique, needle woven over a warp of gold thread.",'animal_fibre'
"Representing spring and summer, fire and air, these hangings (MMA 46.43.1-.4) were part of a larger set that must also have included the two missing seasons and elements. This series included portraits of Louis XIV, his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, marquise de Montespan (1641 – 1707 ), and six of their children, all shown as deities. The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers. The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds. Various birds, insects, and wind instruments are rendered around this medallion, while a sunburst is shown above and Juno with peacock below. The closeness of the depiction of Louis XIV to an image of the king painted on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles by Charles Le Brun in 1683 – 84 makes it likely that the designs for the main figures in the set of hangings were supplied by his workshop; however, they may be the work of the painter François Bonnemer (1638 – 1689 ), who is known to have made cartoons after compositions by Le Brun. In 1685 Bonnemer provided designs for the embroidered seat covers of the benches and stools in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alentours, or decorative borders, full of delightful details, are believed to be by Jean Lemoyen le Lorrain, an artist little known today who worked in the circle of Le Brun.The other embroideries are thought to depict three of Montespan’s children with the king: Louise-Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes (1673 – 1743 ), with flowers symbolizing Flora, or spring (MMA 46.43.1); Françoise-Marie, Mademoiselle de Blois (1677 – 1749 ), with wheat ears, as Ceres, or summer (MMA 46.43.2); and Louis-Auguste, duc de Maine (1670 – 1736 ), in armor, as Mars, or fire (MMA 46.43.3).The compositions of the seasons include floral wreaths with the zodiac symbols for the appropriate months, while salamanders, torches, smoking braziers, and censers pertain to the element fire. The background of these rare surviving embroideries is worked in metal thread, now tarnished, which must have given them a sumptuous and shimmering appearance when they were first made. The hangings were documented in 1718 as in the collection of Louis-Alexandre, comte de Toulouse (1678 – 1737 ), the youngest child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, at the Château de Rambouillet. During the nineteenth century they belonged to King Louis-Philippe and were hung at the Palais Royal, Paris.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, adapted from The Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts/Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide and Jeffrey Munger; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010]",'animal_fibre'
"This tapestry is part of four hangings that have been reconstructed from what originally was a set of three tapestries depicting the Nine (or Ten?) Worthies.  The heroes depicted included King Arthur, Joshua, David, Hector of Troy, and Julius Caesar, along with various attendants.  One of the reconstructed hangings (32.130.2b, 47.101.1, 47.152) shows two of the three Hebrew Worthies in their settings and with nearly all of their attendant figures.  Another represents King Arthur (32.130.2a, 47.101.4), one of the three or possibly four figures that appeared in the original tapestry devoted to the Christian Worthies, together with some attendant figures.  The third and fourth pieces represent respectively Hector of Troy (47.101.2) and Julius Caesar (47.101.3), with attendant, taken from a third tapestry that depicted the three Pagan Worthies.  Other fragments (47.101.5 and 49.123), showing architectural elements, bits of landscape, and the incomplete figures of three cardinals and a bishop, all apparently unconnected to those parts of the three original hangings that survive, are preserved separately in the Metropolitan Museum.",'animal_fibre'
"These two armchairs and a sofa (1987.62.1) are from a set of furniture that also included a daybed, six side chairs, and two additional armchairs. The set was designed by the Bolognese architect Filippo Pelagio Palagi, who in 1832 was commissioned by Carlo Alberto, king of Sardinia, to redecorate his royal palaces. One of these palaces was at Racconigi, and Palagi designed this set of furniture for the principal drawing room next to the royal bedroom.The armchairs and sofa are distinguished by the sculptural treatment of the crest rails and by the quality and refinement of the veneering. The set of furniture was executed by Gabrielle Cappello, whose workshop produced many of Pelagi's designs for Racconigi. The silk upholstery fabric on the armchairs and sofa is a reproduction of the original covering; it was woven by the textile firm that originally produced the fabric in the 1830s.",'animal_fibre'
"A study of paintings from Iran indicates that in the early sixteenth century the typical waist girdle was a leather strap with metal plaques, which then gave way to a narrow textile band with gold fasteners.¹ By the seventeenth century, a long and wide sash wrapped and knotted around the waist was customary.² These sashes had a central field of narrow stripes with decorative panels of flowering plants at either end; they were tied so that these floral panels were visible. The sash was an indispensable accessory and a tool for projecting the status of the wearer. Thomas Herbert, part of an English embassy to Iran in the late 1620s, remarked on both the length of these sashes and the meaningful variation in their materials: ""Their waists are girt with fine towels [a plain fabric band worn under the sash] of silk and gold about 8 yards long; those and the sashes distinguish the quality of those that wear them; dukes and other of the noble sort have them woven with gold, merchants and qezelbash with silver; of silk and wool those of inferior rank.""³ By this measure, an Iranian sash in the Museum's collection (see MMA 33.80.18), with its gold ground extending the whole of its almost fourteen-foot length, must have been worn by a rich and important personage.⁴ A further mark of its quality is the fact that the back of the sash is well finished. Similar sashes were also worn in the Ottoman and Mughal realms on either side of the Safavid cultural sphere. By the late seventeenth century this fashion had spread to parts of eastern Europe such as Poland and Russia, where textiles imported from Iran and Turkey had become status symbols worn by courtiers. Persian sashes became a requisite part of the wardrobe for noblemen of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, at the crossroads between the Ottoman Empire, the Russian Empire, and the European Holy Roman Empire. The aristocracy’s entire style of dress was influenced by fashions from the Safavid and Ottoman courts, but the sash retained its popularity long after other features became more Westernized. By the eighteenth century the demand for silk sashes, or kontusz (and thus known as kontusz sashes) worn over an outer coat, became so great in Poland that domestic manufactories, called persiarnie, were established.⁵ One of the finest eighteenth-century producers was the establishment founded in the city of Sluck, east of Warsaw, by an Armenian named Jan Madjarski and his son Leo⁶ The Madjarskis clearly took great pride in their work and ""signed"" their sashes with woven inscriptions on the end panels (as in this example), where they were certain to be seen. These sashes were normally worn folded in half lengthwise and then wound around the waist. An innovation introduced by the Polish manufacturers was the production of a two-color, double-sided main field that enabled the wearer to extend his wardrobe by folding and tying his sash up to four different ways.⁷From the mid-seventeenth century European observers used the word shawl, derived from the Persian sha¯l, to describe the oblong textiles woven of very fine wool that were used by Iranian men as waist sashes and by Indian men as shoulder coverings. By the late eighteenth century the white ""Kashmir"" shawls with colorful pinecone or paisley motifs at each end became the de rigueur fashion accessory for European women (for an unusual and creative use of a shawl as headgear, see MMA 45.59.3). An early reference to shawls imported to England from the Kashmir region appears in 1767, in the correspondence of British author Laurence Sterne.⁸ French Empress Josephine is often credited with popularizing the trend at the turn of the nineteenth century and is said to have owned more than fifty expensive imported shawls. During the early nineteenth century Kashmiri shawl makers began to replace the plain white field of these textiles with bold colors or stripes. At the same time, Europeans started weaving shawls in an attempt to meet the increased demand for the fashionable accessories. Traditional Kashmir shawls were patterned using a twill tapestry technique, which was extremely time consuming. Driven to make shawls more quickly, European makers normally employed faster weaving techniques, but a few Russian makers retained the tapestry method.⁹ Several of the Russian workshops were run by female members of the landed gentry, who took advantage of the inexpensive serf labor available to them to produce these amazingly fine textiles (see MMA 65.91.1)¹⁰ In that example, the flowers in the pinecone shapes at each end of the shawl can be identified as European species such as poppies, roses, and cornflowers; there even appears to be a type of tuber vegetable anchoring the individual motifs. The vivid stripes of that shawl may have been inspired in part by the colorful men’s sashes being produced in Poland, Russia, and France, which themselves had been inspired by Iranian and Indian precursors.

"Presenting a statue and musician within a fanciful architectural setting, this tapestry is from a set known as the Berain Grotesques, in reference to the pervasive stylistic influence of Jean Berain (1640-1711), who may even have provided preliminary sketches.

"The textile used in this chasuble is iconic of the early Renaissance period and highly valued; it is this type of textile that is often seen in religious paintings of the time. The complex and expensive weave structure incorporates pile-on-pile weaving, as well as gold metallic loops within the velvet that add extra glitter and shading. The three-dimensional surface is achieved through the use of different lengths of pile. The figures have been identified as a youthful St. John the Evangelist, holding the cup of poison that did not harm him; St. Andrew, with the book and X-shaped cross with which he is associated; a bearded St. Paul, holding a book and a sword; St. Thomas, holding a book and a carpenter's angle; and, possibly, St. Philip, holding a book and a staff with a red cross on one end.",'animal_fibre'

"This object is from the collection of Natalia de Shabelsky (1841-1905), a Russian noblewoman compelled to preserve what she perceived as the vanishing folk art traditions of her native country. Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments. Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.This piece represents the pinnacle of this type of work wherein overcast stitching covers the entire drawnwork grid, employing numerous colors and elaborate detail fillings. The depiction of the faces on the birds is startlingly real, leaping out of the fanciful motifs. Each bird has its own character with subtle differences in facial details.

"This tapestry depicts scenes from Amadis of Gaul, a chivalric romance that enjoyed great popularity in European court circles in the late sixteenth century.  Amadis, a knight from Gaul, has fallen in love with Oriane, daughter of the King of England, but she and the ""Damsel of Denmark"" have been kidnapped by the king's enemy, Arcalaus.  Here we see Oriane's rescue.  Toward the center of the scene Amadis encounters the army of Arcalaus and defeats each of his soldiers before finally confronting and killing Arcalaus.  In the foreground, Amadis and Oriane are re-united.Woven from a design by Karel van Mander I, the tapestry is a rare example of late sixteenth-century Dutch production.  It was made in the Delft workshop of the merchant-weaver Frans Spiering (ca. 1550–1620) who had relocated from Antwerp because of the religious turmoil of the era.  The Spiering enterprise enjoyed great success between 1590 and 1620, providing high-quality tapestries to the Protestant courts of northern Europe who were no longer able to buy tapestries from Brussels, the traditional source of high-quality tapestries.  Spiering seems to have enjoyed the unusual privilege of being able to use the coveted ""BB"" symbol of Brussels' production, even though he was not working in that town.Spiering's tapestries had a high silk content, rendering them especially vulnerable to light damage.  This tapestry is remarkable for the intensity and richness of its color.",'animal_fibre'
"This valance, executed in wool tent stitch with silk highlights, follows a common compositional structure found in large-scale narrative embroideries and tapestries, that of combining multiple scenes in one continuous panel. The valance depicts scenes from courtly life, but the precise narrative has not been identified. Yvonne Hackenbroch titled this piece ""The Education of Princess Elizabeth I"" mainly because of the young child with the man in classical garb, said to be a depiction of Elizabeth I’s tutor, Roger Ascham, but there is no other iconography to support this reading. The embroidery could simply illustrate the daily activities of ladies at court, although the interaction of the various figures implies the existence of a specific sequence of events.One possible iconographical reading lies in the identification of contemporary female personifications of the Five Senses. Reading from left to right, the woman gazing into the mirror may personify Sight; the woman with a falcon gesturing toward the young girl may personify Touch; the woman in profile in front of the fountain may represent Smell as she bends toward a potted flower; and the women playing musical instruments would represent Hearing. However, there is no obvious personification of the sense of taste. Additionally, the older man ushering a young girl toward the woman with the falcon, the presence of the jester, and the woman on horseback suggest that a specific narrative is intended.The valance can be compared to other valances and panels with unidentified narratives; similar scenes with equally opaque narratives involving costumed figures and garden settings, for example, are on two valances in the Musée de la Renaissance, Château d’Écouen, documented by Maria-Anne Privat-Savigny in 2003. These hunting and court scenes are interspersed with dramatically posed figures, such as a woman begging on her knees and two decapitations. Other valances and decorative panels of tent stitch illustrate biblical or mythological tales and, more rarely, historical events.Valances of this type have generally been dated to the late sixteenth century, based in part on the attire of the figures and the woven textile patterns that correspond to those found in extant textiles from the period. The clothing closely relates to costume prints from such books as Cesare Vecellio’s Habiti Antichi e Moderni di Diversi Parti del Mondo (1590) and Pierre Bertelli’s Habits des Diverses Nations (1594); these depictions (the first fashion plates) of the dress of various classes and cultures appear to have circulated widely throughout Europe. The use of tent stitch on canvas appeared in England by the middle of the sixteenth century, although it was practiced earlier in France. Santina Levey credits this technique’s introduction to English furnishing textiles to the influence of the French court. It is difficult, therefore, to attribute definitively many of these designs to one place of manufacture, when they were clearly produced in France, Scotland, and England, based on many of the same sources.This panel was most likely one of a set of bed valances intended to decorate the edges of a tester that hung over a bed in order to cover the attachment points of the bed curtains. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the bed was one of the most important pieces of furniture in the household. The finest sets of hangings would have included embroidered inner and outer valances, curtains, a tester, and a counterpane, in addition to embroidered pillows. Embroidered valances were also used to decorate the tops of walls, typically over a wall surface covered in textiles.[Elyse Gerstenecker, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'

"The Museum's set of six armchairs and two settees from the Tapestry Room at Croome Court, Worcestershire, formerly the seat of the earls of Coventry, is among the best documented of all English Neoclassical furniture.¹ It was executed by the leading London cabinetmakers, John Mayhew and William Ince² who in 1769 billed the owner of Croome, George William, the sixth earl (1721-1809), for ""6 Large Antique Elbow Chairs, with oval Backs, Carv'd with Double husks & ribbon, knot on top, Gilt in the Best Burnish'd Gold, Stuff'd with Besthair, in Linen, Backt with Fine Crimson Tammy, proper for Covering with Tapistry in the Country, the patterns included. 2 Settees for Each Side the Chimney, richly Carv'd & Gilt, Stuff'd & Cover'd to match the chairs. 10 Setts of Castors, with Screws, & fixing to the Chairs & Sofas.""³ The floral cartoons for the furniture covers were executed from 1760 to 1767 at the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris by Maurice Jacques (1712-1784) and the decorative artist Louis Tessier (1719/20-1781).  In England this was the first instance in which seat covers were designed en suite with a set of tapestry hangings, which were intended to be used rather like wallpaper, covering the walls from chair rail to cornice. The tapestries had a series of trompe l'oeil medallions with scenes designed by François Boucher (1703-1770) representing allegories of the elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. The tapestries were finally installed in June 1771 by Mayhew and Ince: ""Three Men's time at Croome putting up the Tapestry."" This was the first of several sets of this group of tapestries, called the Tentures de Boucher, woven at the Gobelins for English houses, of which the best known are the ones made for Osterley Park, Middle-sex; Newby Hall, North Yorkshire; Weston Park, Shropshire; and Moor Park, Hertfordshire (now at Aske, North Yorkshire). Between 1902 and 1904 the ninth earl of Coventry sold the tapestries and tapestry-covered furniture and recovered the walls with green damask. Subsequently the original seat covers were acquired by a dealer in Paris, who removed and applied them to a set of modern frames in the Louis XV style. The Tapestry Room from Croome Court was given to the Metropolitan Museum by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1958, together with the modern set of frames. In the following year the original frames were discovered in a warehouse in Paris. They were purchased by the Kress Foundation and shipped to the Museum, where they were refitted with their original tapestry covers.[William Rieder, adapted from European Furniture in The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Highlights of the Collection/ Daniëlle O.

Mercury petitioned her sister, Aglauros, to help him woo Herse. Stricken with jealousy, Aglauros envisioned in great detail how the union between Mercury and her sister might appear.

"This beautifully preserved example is a valuable and instructive addition to the Metropolitan Museum's collection of eighteenth-century fabrics, as it relates to several major trends in the textile arts. The small compartmentalized areas with geometric designs in the manner of lace fillings, as well as the stylized floral bouquets, relate this textile to the so-called lace patterned silks, many of which are attributable to France. The imaginative small interstitial motifs are a hybrid of floral, geometric, and fantastic forms and recall elements found in bizarre silks, a group of disputed origin in part thought to be of Italian manufacture. Other characteristics, however, link the silk to a group of textiles tentatively established by Natalie Rothstein as Dutch. The narrow loom width of approximately sixteen inches is substantially less than that found in many other contemporary European textiles. The scale of the pattern is also reduced, but the precise drawing style and the allowance for space surrounding the motifs avoid any sense of compression or overcrowding. The color scheme of green ground with design in white and judiciously placed details in light and dark blue, pink and salmon, yellow and mustard, complements and further balances the composition. Although symmetrical patterns are not rare at this time, more unusual is the vertical emphasis which occurs when two or more lengths are placed selvage to selvage, thus completing the floral column. This strong visual accent suggests that the textile was probably intended as a furnishing fabric rather than as costume material.",'animal_fibre'

"Whitework samplers typically consist of a variety of stitches and lace-making techniques, all stitched in white thread. It is thought that samplers containing whitework, cutwork, drawnwork, and lace designs were stitched only after multi-colored band samplers were finished, as whitework techniques are more difficult. However, this theory is based on a the very small number of documented seventeenth-century embroiderers who made multiple samplers. This sampler includes bands of acorns and stylized flowers, in addition to four bands of cutwork and drawnwork featuring star and geometric patterns. While many surviving English samplers include lace, cutwork, and drawnwork, few examples of seventeenth-century lace have been attributed to English manufacture.",'animal_fibre'
"Images of gardens were popular in the tapestry medium from the medieval era, where the so-called mille-fleurs (thousand flowers) (see also 2013.506) provided a decorative, and sometimes symbolic, setting for scenes of romance and play. Park and garden tapestries continued to enjoy popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly for the decoration of more intimate chambers, where they provided a pleasant contrast with the grander subject matter of tapestries used in more formal settings. The theme enjoyed new popularity with the advent of the Rococo style during the eighteenth century, and a number of highly decorative landscape and garden series were produced in French and Netherlandish workshops during the second third of the eighteenth century. Among the most notable was the series of romantic pastorals that Boucher designed for the Beauvais workshops between 1734 and 1736 (64.165.1–.8). Known as the Fetes Italiennes, and loosely inspired by the idyllic park scenes of Antoine Watteau, this series depicted handsome gentlefolk and peasants in idealized exterior settings.",'animal_fibre'
"In mentioning cards, I ought to observe, that . . . [the French] learn to play not barely for amusement, but also with a view to advantage; and, indeed, you seldom meet with a native of France, whether male or female, who is not a complete gamester, well versed in all the subtleties and finesses of the art.— Tobias Smollett, Travels through France and ItalyAs gaming was the principal indoor diversion of eighteenth-century France, a variety of tables was created, often for specific games like three-handed ombre or tri, piquet, or brelan. A description of one example in Lazare Duvaux’s account book suggests that this elegant folding table was used for quadrille. On August 9, 1753, the dealer sold a solid mahogany quadrille table ""I"" (folding on the diagonal), embellished with gilt bronze, and lined with cloth, to Madame de Pompadour for 85 livres.[1]When closed, the Museum’s table has a triangular shape and forms a synthesis of sinuous lines, echoed by the double curve of the cabriole legs. One of these S-shaped legs can be pulled backward to support the hinged top when unfolded. A shallow walnut drawer for storage of game essentials is recessed on top of this sliding leg. The rounded corners of the open top could be used for discarded cards and counters or for the placement of candlesticks to offer the players light on their game. Although not stamped, this table has been attributed to Bernard II van Risenburgh, based on the high quality of its tulipwood marquetry inlaid with floral and foliated sprays of end-cut kingwood.Epigraph.

"The settees and chairs illustrated here (see 1974.356.114–.121) were made for the Franckenstein Pavilion in the gardens of Seehof Castle near Bamberg, one of the three summer residences in Southern Germany used by Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, prince bishop of Würzberg and Bamberg. A true garden enthusiast, it was under von Seinsheim that the gardens of Seehof were embellished, which must have resembled the still extant Rococo gardens completed by von Seinsheim at Veitshöchheim. His love for gardens and garden imagery also carried over into the interior decoration and furnishings of his castles, as the Seehof furniture demonstrates. A unique example of German Rococo furniture executed in a more flamboyant style than its French prototypes, the ensemble was designed specifically for the Garden Room in the Franckenstein Pavilion. Used as an audience room, it was referred to as the ""Green Trellis Chamber"" in the 1774 Seehof inventory and painted entirely with trompe l'oeil trellis and foliage.

"Baron Johann Ernst Bernstorff (1712–1772) served as Danish ambassador to the court of Versailles between 1744 and 1751. According to Charles-Philippe d’Albert, duc de Luynes (1695–1758), the diplomat was youthful and witty, possessed both finesse and taste, and spoke the French language better than many native speakers.[1] During his stay in France, Bernstorff formed many friendships and developed a marked taste for the French way of life. It was, therefore, with reluctance that he left Paris and returned to Denmark in 1751 to assume the post of minister of foreign affairs.For the tapestry room of his newly built residence in Copenhagen, he acquired a series of four wall hangings, Les Amours des Dieux (The Loves of the Gods), from the Beauvais Manufactory. Covers for a set of twelve armchairs and two settees (all of which are in the Museum’s collection) were woven at the same time to complement the tapestries. They display lighthearted compositions of animals, birds, and flowers based on designs by Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686–1755). The frames of the seat furniture were made by the Parisian menuisier Nicolas-Quinibert Foliot, who, like his father, Nicolas Foliot, was furniture maker to the king’s household. Eight of the twelve chairs and one of the settees are stamped with his name. Enriched with symmetrically placed Rococo ornament, floral garlands, palm branches, and a large shell motif centered on the crest rail, the undulating outline of the chairs and settees is echoed in the tapestry covers. Arranged along the walls, these pieces formed an integral aspect of the interior decoration of the room, which was furnished by Bernstorff according to the latest French fashion with console tables, mirrors, and gilt bronzes, all acquired in Paris.The tapestry room remained intact until the early twentieth century, when George I of the Hellenes (1845–1913), second son of King Christian IX of Denmark, was the owner of Bernstorff Palace. The crowned-G mark branded in the wooden frames of the chairs and settees identify the pieces as his property. He sold the tapestries and the seat furniture separately, and by 1902 the American financier and collector J. Pierpont Morgan had acquired the chairs and settees for use in his London town house. There, during a visit in 1908 and much to their surprise, Queen Alexandra of England (1844–1925) and her sister Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia (1847 –1928), both Danish princesses, recognized the pieces as having belonged to their brother George. One of them exclaimed, “Why, there are the chairs...our brother had those chairs but they disappeared and we never knew what had become of them; they must have been sold.”[2][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010]Footnotes:[1] Luynes 1735–58/1860 – 65, vol. 6, p. 452.[2] Taylor 1957, p. 24.",'animal_fibre'

"Until 1671 the manufactory known as Savonnerie occupied workshops not only at the Louvre but also at the site of a former soap factory at Chaillot—hence the name Savonnerie, from the French savon, or soap. Textiles created at both locations during the first half of the seventeenth century are generally known as Louis XIII carpets. They are small in size and display a wealth of floral ornament against a black ground. Despite their name, however, many of these exquisite rugs were actually woven early in the reign of Louis XIV, who nominally became king in 1643, a few months before his fifth birthday.This well-preserved example in the Museum’s collection may originally have been intended as a table carpet. Almost serving as a carpet within a carpet, the central field has a border edged with trompe l’oeil tassels that seem to hang down on all sides when the rug is placed on a rectangular table the size of the field. Decorating the central panel is a floral wreath enclosing a large bouquet, flanked at either narrow end by a stone pedestal on which a basket of flowers is placed. The outer border is embellished with bowls, baskets, and vases filled with fruit and flowers that alternate with floral bouquets, echoing motifs seen in contemporary paintings. The bright colors used for the profusion of naturalistic flowers give the carpet a particularly fresh and lively appearance. Among them is the striped or flamed tulip; its bulb commanded high prices, resulting in a frenzy of speculation called tulipomania during the 1630s. The blue and white bowls reflect the fashion for Chinese porcelain, a prized commodity imported to Europe by ships of the East India Companies.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010]",'animal_fibre'

"Close analysis reveals that the swath of lace covering this rare chasuble has actually been assembled from over a dozen different pieces of Venetian gros point, arranged to fit the Roman silhouette. Needle lacemaking emerged in Venice in the last decade of the fifteenth century, and its elaborate openwork patterns, defined by negative space, were unlike any textile that had come before. This technique developed out of cutwork, in which a woven linen foundation is traced with a pattern which is then cut out, and stitches are worked back into the voided areas. Eventually this evolved into punto in aria (literally “stitches in air”), wherein the base fabric was no longer necessary and the stitches were worked directly onto parchment. Gros point needle lace was perhaps the pinnacle of this technique, with three-dimensional motifs worked so densely that they almost appear to be carved from ivory. The sculptural elements are padded with linen or wool fibers, and covered with thousands of buttonhole stitches in extremely fine linen thread.Although gros point peaked in popularity between 1650 and 1670, it was incredibly time consuming to make and thus remained very valuable even after it fell out of fashion for secular dress. Given that lacemaking was common work in convents, it follows that a church could have had many pieces of lace on hand to contribute to a set of vestments. In Italy, the church continued to support the lacemaking industry, commissioning objects for ecclesiastical use long after the demand for gros point began to wane. The lace in this chasuble is predominantly made up of long, narrow borders which have been arranged in a mirrored pattern on the front and back. These vary in scale from dense patterns of smaller motifs forming an orphrey down the front and back, to larger, more wide-set motifs on either side. The narrowest strips outline the orphrey as well as the neck opening, and run around the back of the chasuble. Many individual motifs have been cut and rearranged to fill in gaps in the design, connected with bars of buttonhole stitches dotted with picots.While gros point is the predominant type of lace represented on the chasuble, two other types of needle lace are also used. Point plat, literally meaning flat point, was a needle lace worked in similar scrolling patterns to gros point, but without any three-dimensional elements. To blend it more seamlessly into this chasuble, the point plat has had raised flourishes applied to the surface, but upon closer inspection it still retains a flatter effect overall. On the front of the chasuble at the bottom left, two pieces of tape lace are also incorporated, with similar raised elements attached to imitate gros point. Tape lace was a much quicker method of lacemaking wherein lengths of woven tape were arranged into a pattern and stitched together. Also known as Battenburg lace, its popularity peaked in the nineteenth century in competition with machine-made lace, but much earlier examples exist as well.While wide bands of lace were a commonly used on albs, chasubles made entirely of handmade lace are extremely rare. There are very few extant examples in the world, but those known are a similar set of lace vestments at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London [inventory number 1411-1871], and a chasuble at the St. Gallen Textile Museum in Switzerland [inventory number 51480]. The chasuble in the collection of the Victoria and Albert is comprised of many strips of gros point borders, arranged in a mirrored pattern with a Y-shaped orphrey on the back. In contrast, the lace on the chasuble in St. Gallen appears to have been constructed of larger pieces of lace made to fit the garment, making it even more of an extreme rarity. The vestment set of which this chasuble is a part was passed down as a family heirloom by the Priuli family of Venice. It includes the chasuble, a maniple [10.186.2], a stole [10.186.3], and a chalice veil [10.186.4]. Descending from a noble Hungarian lineage, the Priuli family relocated to Venice almost a millennia ago and were admitted to the Grand Council in 1100. Their family tree includes three Doges and four Cardinals, the most well-known being Antonio Priuli, who was Doge in Venice from 1618 to 1623. In 1907, one of the family’s heirs sold these rare vestments to Jacques Krakauer, a lace dealer in New York City. It was purchased by the Museum as a complete set in 1910.[Elena Kanagy-Loux, 2017]",'animal_fibre'

"This volume is a compendium of the writings of King Charles I pertaining to the last years of his reign. It is divided into two parts—""matters Civil"" and ""matters Sacred""—and includes additional material gathered from his supporters about events surrounding his death. It constitutes an expanded edition of an earlier compilation, the Eikon Basilike [Image of the King]: The Poutraicture of His Sacred Maiestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings, a 1649 printing of which is bound into the second part of the volume. The Eikon Basilike purported to be a collection of the writings of Charles I that presented the major events of his life and reign from his own point of view in language that was simple, direct, and, for a monarch, unprecedentedly personal. This narrative was interspersed with the king’s favorite prayers and psalms in a style that directly echoed the Penitential Psalms of King David and thereby offered both a justification of his rule and a kind of spiritual autobiography.The Eikon Basilike was first published by Richard Royston, who was the leading Royalist publisher in London throughout the Civil War period and who was imprisoned in 1645 for issuing ""scandalous books and papers"" against the Parliament and thereafter in constant danger of further harassment at the hands of the Council of State. By his own account, Royston received orders directly from the king in October 1648 to prepare his printing press; on December 23 he was given the manuscript through an Edward Simmons, as from the king, and had it printed. Charles’s authorship has been contested from its first appearance to the present day, although it is now widely agreed (as the Royalist apologists had insisted) that the core of the book was Charles’s but that the materials were shaped into their final form by his chaplain, the Presbyterian divine John Gauden, later bishop of Exeter.From the beginning, the Eikon Basilike was a hugely popular best-seller and became the chief focus of national grief and guilt after the king’s death. The book was sold on the streets of London on January 30, 1649, the day of Charles’s execution, and went through thirty-five English editions that year. It became, in effect, a form of common property, hotly debated among Parliamentarian detractors and their Royalist opponents and prompting numerous rebuttals and counter-rebuttals, including John Milton’s furious rejoinder, Eikonoklastes, which appeared on October 6, 1649. As Elizabeth Wheeler emphasized, the Eikon Basilike had no single fixed appearance and from the first was subject to numerous additions of text and images. The work also appeared in a range of cheap to expensive editions and in different formats, from regular folio size to tiny miniature versions.The present copy of Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae is one product of this process, although Frances Madan noted that all the additional materials within were vouched for by persons who were near the king and involved in the publication process of the original Eikon Basilike. It includes a miscellany of the king’s speeches to Parliament, his ""Messages for Peace,"" and, in the second part, a selection of his prayers, the text of the Eikon Basilike, his ""papers about Church Government,"" a list of the judges who officiated at Charles’s trial in a section headed ""Severall things relating to His Majesties Death, a list of London’s mayor and city aldermen, and various speeches and epitaphs by others made after the king’s death. According to Madan, this edition was published in London by Roger Norton with the false Hague imprint of Samuel Browne, suggesting that there was an inherent danger for Royston and his London printer, Roger Norton, in publishing such materials during these years.The embroidered cover of this volume has on the front the figure of a woman holding a cornucopia, probably representing Plenty; on the back is a woman holding a palm branch, presumably Peace. Plenty and Peace were likely qualities that the owner attached to monarchical rule. Embroidered references or borrowings from the Eikon Basilike include in the Victoria and Albert Museum collection an embroidered panel after the William Marshall engraving used as the frontispiece for the 1649 version of the Eikon Basilike (inv. no. T.117-1936). The frontispiece of this volume is an engraved portrait of Charles I by Wenceslaus Hollar (MMA, 17.50.85) that is derived from the double portrait of Charles and Henrietta Maria by Anthony van Dyck.[Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'

"Representing spring and summer, fire and air, these hangings (MMA 46.43.1-.4) were part of a larger set that must also have included the two missing seasons and elements. This series included portraits of Louis XIV, his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, marquise de Montespan (1641 – 1707 ), and six of their children, all shown as deities. The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers. The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds. Various birds, insects, and wind instruments are rendered around this medallion, while a sunburst is shown above and Juno with peacock below. The closeness of the depiction of Louis XIV to an image of the king painted on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles by Charles Le Brun in 1683 – 84 makes it likely that the designs for the main figures in the set of hangings were supplied by his workshop; however, they may be the work of the painter François Bonnemer (1638 – 1689 ), who is known to have made cartoons after compositions by Le Brun. In 1685 Bonnemer provided designs for the embroidered seat covers of the benches and stools in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alentours, or decorative borders, full of delightful details, are believed to be by Jean Lemoyen le Lorrain, an artist little known today who worked in the circle of Le Brun.The other embroideries are thought to depict three of Montespan’s children with the king: Louise-Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes (1673 – 1743 ), with flowers symbolizing Flora, or spring (MMA 46.43.1); Françoise-Marie, Mademoiselle de Blois (1677 – 1749 ), with wheat ears, as Ceres, or summer (MMA 46.43.2); and Louis-Auguste, duc de Maine (1670 – 1736 ), in armor, as Mars, or fire (MMA 46.43.3).The compositions of the seasons include floral wreaths with the zodiac symbols for the appropriate months, while salamanders, torches, smoking braziers, and censers pertain to the element fire. The background of these rare surviving embroideries is worked in metal thread, now tarnished, which must have given them a sumptuous and shimmering appearance when they were first made. The hangings were documented in 1718 as in the collection of Louis-Alexandre, comte de Toulouse (1678 – 1737 ), the youngest child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, at the Château de Rambouillet. During the nineteenth century they belonged to King Louis-Philippe and were hung at the Palais Royal, Paris.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, adapted from The Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts/Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide and Jeffrey Munger; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010]",'animal_fibre'
"The story of Jacob as depicted in this set of six tapestries (1983.73.1–.6) begins with the scene of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob (Gen. 25:29–34). Esau, the hunter, sits with his bow and quiver at his feet. He clasps hands with Jacob, his brother, who is clad in the starred robe that will identify him throughout the story. By this handshake Esau and Jacob seal their agreement, and the former accepts a bowl of food in exchange for his birthright as firstborn. The secondary scenes represent different moments in time and serve to advance the story. In the center distance Esau is shown hunting with two dogs. To the right, Rebecca, mother of Esau and Jacob, is seen cooking outside the tent, probably preparing food for Jacob to present o his father, Isaac (Gen. 27). The narrative continues to unfold in the other tapestries, which depict Rachel giving her servant Bilhah to Jacob (Gen. 30:1–4), Rachel and Bilhah with her son Dan, and Jacob making a covenant with his father-in-law, Laban (Gen. 31:43–53), a scene combined with Laban looking for the images (Gen. 31:33–35) and his farewell to his daughters and grandchildren (Gen. 32:1). Jacob’s sacrifice after this covenant is shown in the fifth tapestry (Gen. 31:54), while the sixth illustrates Jacob both burying idols under an oak tree (Gen. 35:4) and building an altar in Bethel (Gen. 35:6–7). Although this set may be complete, it is unlikely, since certain frequently illustrated scenes, such as Isaac blessing Jacob and Jacob’s dream, are not included. Moreover, as this set is woven from designs made earlier, there may have once been additional cartoons. Indeed, three related tapestries, with some central scenes similar to our set, but with different borders, are in the Residenz Museum in Munich. These tapestries all bear the Brussels city mark and that of the weaver Jan van Tiegen. The first depicts events immediately following the selling of the birthright: Esau with the ailing Isaac discovers his father has blessed his brother (Gen. 27:30–41) and Jacob being sent to find a wife (Gen. 28:2–5). The second tapestry depicts Jacob at the well of Haran (Gen. 29:2–14); the third combines both the scenes of Jacob’s covenant with Laban and of his subsequent sacrifice. In the Museum’s set these latter two scenes appear in separate hanging and the figures bringing stones for the sacrificial altar appear twice: to the right of the scene of the covenant and to the left of the scene of the sacrifice. This indicates that the original cartoon was divided to provide patterns for hangings of narrower widths. On stylistic grounds, the tapestries can be dated to the third quarter of the sixteenth century. The double ""B"" and shield, which appear in the guard stripe of five of the tapestries, identify Brussels as the city of manufacture. However, neither the designer nor the weaver is known, although there are clues to identify the latter. Four of the tapestries do bear a weaver’s mark: a merged ""C"" and ""T"" with three stars to the right. This mark, which is also found on tapestries in Boston, Berlin, and Cologne, was formerly thought to indicate the Brussels weaver Corneille Tseraets, but it has been proven that he used a different mark. Yet another unidentified weaver’s mark appears in the upper right guard of the tapestry depicting Jacob burying idols; however, this mark has been set into the tapestry and is not integral to it. Perhaps the most pleasing aspect of these tapestries, which have retained their bright colors and are in good condition, are the wide, well-designed borders that frame five of the hangings. Fruits, flowers, and architectural elements are combined with animals and birds, native and exotic, to produce entertaining and lively surrounds. A veritable menagerie encircles the scene of Esau selling his birthright. In the left border an eagle, a hooded falcon, a hawk, and an elephant are depicted; at center bottom, a stag and a doe. The right border houses a stork, an owl, a mammal that may be a beaver, while at center top one bird attacks another. The naturalistic details are not restricted to the border motifs. The settings of the central scenes contain a variety of flora, and in many cases specific trees and plants can be identified. Although there are several exceptional sixteenth-century Brussels tapestries in the Museum’s collection, this bequest represents the first substantial set of hangings from this period and place of manufacture.",'animal_fibre'

"This tapestry is not a fragment, but is instead a small, devotional work. The representation is based on a painted prototype by Guido Reni, of which the most important iteration is in Rome’s Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica (Palazzo Corsini), perpetuated in many derivative paintings.  The tapestry is attributed to weavers working in Rome at the San Michele manufactory, which had been founded in 1710 by Pope Clement XI to complement the wool and dyeing workshops at the orphanage of San Michele a Ripa. It is part of a large group of technically proficient tapestries, many made as diplomatic gifts, modelled after paintings in the Vatican collection; with the exception of a handful of more sophisticated tapestry series (like Gerusalemme Liberata, four pieces of which are also in The Met’s collection), these woven copies comprised the main activity of the San Michele weavers, alongside repair and restoration of older northern European tapestries in the papal collection.",'animal_fibre'
"The settees and chairs illustrated here (see 1974.356.114–.121) were made for the Franckenstein Pavilion in the gardens of Seehof Castle near Bamberg, one of the three summer residences in Southern Germany used by Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, prince bishop of Würzberg and Bamberg. A true garden enthusiast, it was under von Seinsheim that the gardens of Seehof were embellished, which must have resembled the still extant Rococo gardens completed by von Seinsheim at Veitshöchheim. His love for gardens and garden imagery also carried over into the interior decoration and furnishings of his castles, as the Seehof furniture demonstrates. A unique example of German Rococo furniture executed in a more flamboyant style than its French prototypes, the ensemble was designed specifically for the Garden Room in the Franckenstein Pavilion. Used as an audience room, it was referred to as the ""Green Trellis Chamber"" in the 1774 Seehof inventory and painted entirely with trompe l'oeil trellis and foliage. The garden room's furniture was made to match: the backs of the chairs and settees are richly carved in the form of garden trellis-work with colored flowers and foliage.",'animal_fibre'
"Images of gardens were popular in the tapestry medium from the medieval era, where the so-called mille-fleurs (thousand flowers) (see also MMA 2013.506) provided a decorative, and sometimes symbolic, setting for scenes of romance and play. Park and garden tapestries continued to enjoy popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly for the decoration of more intimate chambers, where they provided a pleasant contrast with the grander subject matter of tapestries used in more formal settings. The theme enjoyed new popularity with the advent of the Rococo style during the eighteenth century, and a number of highly decorative landscape and garden series were produced in French and Netherlandish workshops during the second third of the eighteenth century. Among the most notable was the series of romantic pastorals that Boucher designed for the Beauvais workshops between 1734 and 1736 (MMA 64.165.1–.8). Known as the Fetes Italiennes, and loosely inspired by the idyllic park scenes of Antoine Watteau, this series depicted handsome gentlefolk and peasants in idealized exterior settings.",'animal_fibre'
"Tapestry-woven upholstery for two settees and twelve armchairs was commissioned at the same time as the wall hangings depicting the Four Continents (1978.404.1–.4).¹ The Four Continents was one of two suites・each including four wall tapestries and coordinating seating furniture・that were ordered from Beauvais in 1786; the subject of the other suite was to be a series illustrating the arts, sciences, agriculture, and commerce. An earlier suite of tapestry furniture covers depicting the continents was produced at the Royal Manufactory of Gobelins in 1748, and the arrangement of the motifs in Le Barbier’s covers is similar: personifications of the continents are set against a landscape on the seat backs, and native animals populate the seat covers.²This subject in tapestry aligns with the contemporary popularity of the Four Continents in eighteenth-century European art: everything from porcelain table decorations and tablewares to dinner napkins and ceiling frescoes incorporated personifications of the continents (see MMA 64.101.1347, 1348). The settee showing America and Europe emphasizes the close relationship between France and the new United States, which France promoted so forcefully in the tapestry depicting America. The figure of France occupies the center of the sofa back, and America is seated off to the left. In this composition, France is ‘introducing the new nation to Europe across Neptune’s domain, the Atlantic; France’s discarded armor lies at her feet, as the war has been won, and Victory crowns her.’³ The armchairs repeat the female personifications of each continent, attended by male figures and some of the fauna typically associated with each. There are three variations on each of the four continents, and, although they are all slightly different, the iconographic program is consistent. It appears that this upholstery was not affixed to furniture frames until sometime after 1852, decades after its production.⁴ Usually, a client commissioned or purchased high-quality tapestry upholstery before furniture frames were made to accommodate the weavings. This type of upholstery was quite popular in the late eighteenth century, and the Beauvais manufactory made many such sets.⁵ However, the combination of matching wall hangings and seating furniture was more unusual, and clearly more expensive. A suite of furnishings would have been reserved for a formal room, such as a salon or drawing room.

"Ecclesiastical garments were meant to contribute to the sense of mystery and awe associated with worship; this beautifully crafted chasuble exemplifies that practice. The depiction of the figures is artfully rendered, the skin tones expressed in applied silk with facial features and other details, such as hair and the definition of fingers depicted in embroidery. This chasuble is part of a set that includes a cope (2009.300.2949), a second chasuble (2009.300.2952a–c) and two dalmatics (2009.300.3411a, b and 2009.300.3412a, b).",'animal_fibre'
"Joseph-Marie Jacquard (1752–1834) invented the Jacquard mechanism, a patterning device than, when attached to a loom, made it practical to weave more detailed designs than were previously possible. This woven silk portrait of the inventor is based on a painting by Claude Bonnefond (1796–1860) that was commissioned by the city of Lyon in 1831. The Lyon manufacturer Didier, Petit et Cie ordered the silk version from weaver Michel-Marie Carquillat, who became a specialist in this kind of work. The Museum owns another woven picture after a painting by Bonnefond, showing the duc d'Aumale (son of the French king Louis-Philippe) visiting Carquillat's atelier.The silk picture convincingly portrays elements such as a translucent curtain over glass window panes. Only after the Jacquard loom came into use could a work of this extreme level of detail be produced–a contemporary journal reported that one Lyonnais printer actually mistook a woven portrait.",'animal_fibre'
"This panel was one of a set of three valances probably used to decorate the tester of a bed. Small elements—fruits, flowers, and leaves—were worked in tent stitch on canvas and then applied to the dark velvet foundation on which was worked the river in the Garden of Eden, the figures of Adam and Eve, and God the Father, in polychrome silk and metal threads. The garden is monumental, almost overwhelming the figures. The three trees that anchor the composition would have brought to mind the biblical description of trees in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. The scene of Adam and Eve being expelled from Eden on the far right may also derive from a reading of contemporary vernacular English Bibles, rather than any pictorial convention. Adam and Eve wear garments that suggest articles of late Elizabethan dress and the Geneva Bible of 1560 referred to their first clothes as ""breeches."" In this and other embroidered renderings of the story of the expulsion from Eden, Adam and Eve are treated more gently by God and the expelling angel than they are in contemporary print sources.",'animal_fibre'
"This panel was probably intended as a cushion cover. It illustrates scenes from the life of the biblical patriarch Abraham, as recounted in the Book of Genesis. The central scene shows Abraham being informed by a host of angels that his wife Sarah will bear him a son, despite her advanced age. Other scenes include Abraham banishing his servant Hagar and her son by Abraham, Ishmael (lower left corner), and Abraham's attempted sacrifice of Sarah's son Isaac, the act he was ordered by God to perform as a test of his faith (upper right corner).Biblical narratives were extremely popular subjects for seventeenth-century pictorial embroideries, and a number of other examples depicting the life of Abraham exist. The imagery of the Museum's example is derived from engravings after Maarten de Vos which first appeared in Gerard de Jode's 1579 illustrated bible Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamenti, published in Antwerp. These engravings were also the inspiration for other biblical embroideries, such as the story of David and Bathsheba, and David and Abigail (see 64.101.1325).",'animal_fibre'

"As its full-size domed canopy is suspended from the ceiling rather than supported on posts, this tester bed, which bears the stamp of the menuisier Georges Jacob, is a type called lit à la duchesse en impériale. Its original but now fragile hangings, woven in 1782–83 at the Beauvais tapestry manufactory after designs by Jean-Baptiste Huet (1745–1811), have been replaced by modern silk damask, except for the lining of the interior dome. French eighteenth-century beds tended to be lofty, as it was customary to pile them with three or more mattresses filled with straw, wool, horsehair, or feathers. Tobias Smollett (1721–1771) noted in 1766, “French beds are so high, that sometimes one is obliged to mount them by the help of steps.”[1]The custom of receiving visitors while reposing in a large and elegantly fitted out bed was practiced in France during the eighteenth century mostly by aristocratic women. The Museum’s imposing piece of furniture with its exquisitely carved floral decoration, the work of an unknown carver, must have formed a splendid backdrop for such official calls or congratulatory visits. In 1791 the bed is documented as standing in the large bedchamber of Guyonne-Marguerite de Durfort de Lorge, duchesse de Choiseul-Praslin (1737–1806), at her Parisian home, the Hôtel de Belle Isle. Following the turmoil of the Revolution and the political changes of the early nineteenth century, the bed was sold in Paris in 1830. It became part of the famous collections at Hamilton Palace, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the residence of Alexander Hamilton Douglas, tenth Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852), where it was placed in one of the state rooms. The duke’s grandson sold the contents of the palace, including the bed, at a highly anticipated auction that took place in 1882. Through the intermediation of several dealers, the bed was acquired in 1897 by the financier and railroad executive George J. Gould (1864–1923). His wife, the former actress Edith M. Kingdon (1864–1921), used it in her bedroom of their New York town house.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010]Footnotes:[1] Tobias George Smollett. Travels through France and Italy. London, 1766.

"“Some carry in their hands feather fans, others nothing; but all wear very costly gloves,” noted an Italian visitor to London in summer 1618. Indeed, by the early seventeenth century, small goods could be purchased from shops or peddlers, making objects such as readymade gloves, purses, ribbons, caps, and trimmings available to consumers. “This fashion of gloves is so universal,” the visitor continued, “that even the porters wear them very ostentatiously.”These tapestry-woven, light colored gloves, which showcase an arrangement of popular flowers—carnations, roses, harebells, pansies, and strawberry plants—were likely purchased from a shop, rather than designed for an individual. Although readymade, the gloves were still a luxury; this pair comprises pink, green, citron, and blue silks joined with salmon-colored silk ribbon, lined in taffeta, and edged with metallic bobbin lace and paillettes. They may originally have been perfumed, as well.  -Sarah Bochicchio, 2020",'animal_fibre'

"Until recently, products of the Dutch silk-weaving industry have been difficult to identify. The duc de Richelieu (Louis-Francois- Armand de Vignerod du Plessis, 1696 ・ 1788) collected hundreds of European textile samples between 1720 and 1736 in an attempt to document local and regional production; included in this collection are several woven silks from the Netherlands labeled “Indiennes.” This nomenclature and certain characteristics of the group have been confirmed by recent archival research in Amsterdam.¹  These fabrics have a width of about 30 1⁄2 inches (78 centimeters) and feature distinctively playful patterns with exotic elements, mostly interpretations of Chinese motifs.²  Dutch silk indiennes were certainly intended for fashionable womens dress, as is evident from a particularly spectacular example of Dutch silk weaving at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (no. 43.1871a-c). The Dutch were exporting silk textiles to England, France, and Portugal (and probably indirectly to North America through the British trade) by at least the early eighteenth century. In 1707 an Amsterdam silk manufacturer was called upon to testify to the origin of several Dutch silks after such goods were stopped by English customs on their way into London because they were thought to be from India.³ Both England and France banned the import of Asian silks around the turn of the eighteenth century as protectionist measures in favor of their own silk-weaving industries.⁴Whether the Dutch silk indiennes of the 1720s to 1750s were still confused with Asian silks is not certain; to the modern eye, they are clearly examples of European chinoiserie.  This particular pattern shows a compact walled garden with tiny pagodas flanked by oversize Chinese-style vases holding large flowers. In his 1769 memoirs Jacques-Charles Dutillieu (1718 ・ 1782), a French silk designer and manufacturer, dismissed the quality of Dutch silk designs, saying they were either bad copies of French patterns or designs taken from textiles from the “Indes Orientales” appropriated with a rather unrefined taste.⁵ While his comments are clearly untrue of this charming design, they confirm the competitive nature of the silk industries within western Europe. Although the use of fashionable textiles for ecclesiastical vestments certainly predates the eighteenth century, based on surviving vestments this practice appears to have accelerated after 1700. Eighteenth-century vestments made of dress silks are often attributed to France; the use here of the older Italian woven silk as the hood of this cope is an unusual variation on the practice.

"Constructed from two different fabrics, this chasuble was probably made and used in Portugal in a Jesuit context. The body of the garment is a Portuguese white silk of the late seventeenth—early eighteenth century brocaded with polychrome silk and chenille yarns. The bright white satin ground of the center panels at front and back are embroidered with silk and silver threads; the materials of this center panel, including the satin ground fabric, are likely from Asia.¹ Narrow metallic woven bands, or galloons, outline the panels and neckline.²A variety of images—including fanciful fountains, unicorns amid cypress trees, spotted leopards, peacocks with tails in full display, and several figures including Hercules and the haloed Christ Child—have been scattered by the weaver throughout the largely secular brocade of the side panels.³ In contrast, the subject matter of the embroidered center panels is entirely Christian. On the front panel are the embroidered initials IHS, the Latin anagram for Jesus Christ used by the Jesuits, while the back panel bears a superimposed A and M for ""Ave Maria"" (or Hail Mary), the archangel Gabriel’s salutation to the Virgin as reported in Luke 1:28. Above the two letters is a crown, and the entire image is surrounded by lilies. An embroidered inscription, qui pascitu inter lilia, a phrase from the Song of Songs (6:3) that translates as ""He who feedeth among the lilies,"" surrounds a silver Paschal Lamb (representing the Lamb of God). Other Christian symbols in the panels include the Pelican in Her Piety, a flowering rose, and a silver pomegranate. The many references to the Virgin in the imagery suggest that this chasuble was used in a convent or in a Jesuit church dedicated to Marian devotion.⁴This elaborate embroidery, with its variety of silk and metallic threads, shares traits and materials from both Portugal and Asia. The multicolor bands that represent the pelican, for example, are typical of Philippine embroidery (detail), yet the bright yellow dye is weld, a European dyestuff.⁵ The flatness of the needlework and its limited palette, as well as the detailed rendering of the individual feathers at the tips of the birds’ wings, are features that may be more Asian than European. A Peruvian example, based on an Asian model, also depicts bird feathers in this way.⁶  It may be that the embroidery took place in Portugal, with artisans also following the Asian model, using a composite of Asian and Portuguese materials.

The brocade, a five-harness silk on a white satin ground with weft float patterning, includes a number of different colors and types of yarns. Some are unspun silk, others are plied two-color (black and white), and still others are chenille yarns with a pile. The two center panels are a white satin seven-harness ground fabric with warp and weft yarns bearing no twist, which likely was imported from China. The embroidery for the silk is satin stitch, with couching stitches to hold the metallic yarns that outline the designs. The embroidery is sparse, revealing the white background throughout. 2.

This imagery is related to that in a more narrative panel with a large fountain as its central motif (Metropolitan Museum, acc. no. 35.30).

"This embroidered panel and MMA 64.101.1347 were probably the two ends of a decorative table carpet. The practice of covering tables with precious textiles began in Europe in the thirteenth century, when some imported pile carpets from the Middle East were considered too fine to be walked upon.European personifications of the Four Continents were frequently employed to confer honor and authority on a specific ruler. In this instance, the crowned couple representing ""Europe"" resembles King Charles II of England (r. 1660–85) and his Portuguese wife, Catherine of Braganza (1638–1705), suggesting a prominent position for England in a global context. The motifs of the Seasons and the Planets refer to the passage of time.",'animal_fibre'
"This splendid piece of silk damask features a pattern of ovoid forms framed by a garland of leaves, with the repeat separated into fields including a large diamond ring emerging from a crown from which hang three pears. This pattern, or ones quite similar, range in date from 1516 to well into the seventeenth century; its popularity raises the interesting question of the heraldry's identification. It is often thought to have been designed for the Medici—the diamond ring being one of their symbols—or another family whose name played on the word pera, or pear, such as the Peruzzi or the Peri. However, its widespread use suggests the motif of the ring must have made it appropriate for many families, maybe within the context of a wedding.",'animal_fibre'
"The years between 1815 and 1848 in Germany and Austria were characterized by a conservative political and cultural climate. The period and its style of interior decoration are both called Biedermeier, after a  fictional character invented by the poet Ludwig Eichrodt (1827–1892) in the 1850s. Although the term invokes qualities typical of the German bourgeoisie (unpretentiousness, thrift, domesticity), the origin of the Biedermeier furniture style was totally aristocratic. The simple, elegant forms with their clean lines and light-colored wood veneer derived from the ornamentally restrained furniture that had been made for the royal and princely households of Germany, Austria, and France beginning in the late eighteenth century.[1] For this market, even Parisian ébénistes, such as Canabas, Saunier, Jacob, and Molitor,[2] produced simple mahogany pieces that were set apart only by their excellent materials and outstanding craftsmanship.[3] Berlin, Munich, and Viennese cabinetmakers followed suit, creating similar, refined furniture.[4]Contemporary watercolors document that Biedermeier interiors were characterized by the use of strong colors for paint, wallpaper, and fabrics.[5] Consequently, the upholstery specialist of the Metropolitan Museum's Objects Conservation Department was delighted but not surprised to discover some silk threads of a strong aquamarine color beneath the former show covers on the present chair and its pair, which is also in the Museum's collection.[6] An appropriate fabric was acquired and dyed to match these remnants of the earliest upholstery. Seldom are curators and conservators given such a splendid opportunity to recreate the original appearance of a piece of furniture and to do it with the correct material, in this case, precious silk. The spring upholstery on the drop-on seats is original, as are large parts of the surface finish.[7] The quest for truly comfortable seating furniture characterized the Biedermeier period: in 1822 Georg Junigl obtained a patent in Vienna ""for his improvement on contemporary methods of furniture upholstery which, by means of a special preparation of hemp and with the assistance of iron springs, he renders so elastic that it is not inferior to horsehair upholstery.""[8]The Museum's side chairs, originally part of a set of six, can be attributed to the firm of Josef Ulrich Danhauser (1780–1829), the leading furniture manufacturer in Vienna.[9] He had many royal patrons, including Archduke Karl von Sachsen Teschen (1771–1847) and Duke Albert von Sachsen Teschen (1738–1822). The Danhauser factory produced some items in large quantities, and these pieces established the  firm's reputation throughout Central Europe and Northern Italy.[10][Wolfram Koeppe 2006]Footnotes:[1] Josef Folnesics.

"This tapestry panel is part of a set of twelve armchairs and two settees ordered in Paris in 1753 by Baron Johann Ernst Bernstorff, Danish ambassador to the court of Versailles between 1744 and 1751. After returning to Denmark, Bernstorff commissioned this seat furniture for the tapestry room of his new residence in Copenhagen that was hung with four wall tapestries of the Amours des Dieux series woven at the Beauvais Manufactory. The tapestry covers are woven with animal and bird subjects after designs by the painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686–1755). For a fuller description of the entire set, see, e.g., MMA 35.145.1.",'animal_fibre'
"This fragment is all that remains of a spectacular example of the weaver's art. A red satin fabric, visible only in the outline of the design, was used as a foundation for a sumptuous pattern composed of glittering metal threads. Gold and silver metal strips were wound around colored silk threads to create the flexible threads that were then woven into pile loops. This is not technically classed as a velvet because the loops are made from metal thread wefts, not from supplementary silk warps, as in a true velvet.The design is the same as that seen on the back of the birth tray commissioned for Lorenzo de' Medici (see 1995.7): the three feather/plumes encircled by a diamond ring above a scrolling ribbon containing the word SEMPER, meaning ""always."" The feathers on the textile were originally silvery-white, red, and green, but the silver metal thread has tarnished, leaving the feather on the left side looking dull gray.Though we cannot be sure of the original dimensions of the textile, it was probably woven as a long border, with a repeating pattern of the Medici device, which may have alternated with other symbolic emblems relating to the family. A valuable textile such as this, specifically woven for the Medici family, would most likely have been reserved for use during important family events, such as marriages, or used on an important piece of furniture, such as the best bed in the household or a canopy covering a ceremonial chair. The device of the three feathers encircled by the ring above the motto SEMPER was used to decorate a variety of objects; other examples include a maiolica bowl, horse trappings, and ceremonial headgear.",'animal_fibre'
"Small decorative purses and bags such as this one rarely appear in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century portraits, but they have survived in relatively large numbers.

"This work is an example of a Marken Island sampler. Samplers from this area are characterized by bands of colorful patterns. Girls stitched these bands to practice patterns for ""vernaaide linten,"" ribbons that were attached to a cap and which were an important part of the costume tradition on Marken Island. These ribbons consisted of black embroidery on white linen. The women of Marken are said to have kept their samplers in or near their kitchens for handy reference, so much of the needlework appears darkened from residue from cooking fires. Samplers from this area, including this one, often include striped horses. This work’s other motifs include a peacock, dog in a house or other enclosure, human figures, and striped roosters.",'animal_fibre'
"Picking up the narrative from the tapestry of Aglauros’s Vision of the Bridal Chamber of Herse displayed near-by, this is the final episode in the story of the god Mercury’s love for the mortal princess of Athens, Herse. Emboldened by her jealous vision of Mercury and Herse’s union, Herse’s sister Aglauros barred his entry to her sister’s apartments. In his anger and frustration, Mercury transformed Aglauros into stone; in the tapestry, we see her disappearing into the door-frame. Mercury can seen again at the right, flying away and leaving the longed-for union with Herse unfulfilled. Such was the appeal of Lodi’s designs for this tapestry series that his cartoon-models were used, and reused, for decades: Willem de Pannnemaker, one of the most admired and successful master-weavers working in Brussels, directed the weaving of this sumptuous edition approximately thirty years after it was designed.",'animal_fibre'

"This sampler features both colored silk embroidery and white cutwork, in addition to a bobbin lace edging (probably a later addition). Unfinished acorn and oak leaf, flower pot, and geometric motifs are stitched in a light brown thread on the top half of the sampler, while cutwork and drawnwork geometric patterns are present on the work’s bottom half and top left corner. Cutwork, from which needle lace developed, is a technique in which portions of the ground fabric are cut away and reinforced with embroidery stitches and filled in with needle lace. While many surviving English samplers include lace, cutwork, and drawnwork, very few examples of seventeenth-century lace have been attributed to English manufacture.",'animal_fibre'
"Beneath a fanciful and elegant loggia, gamboling devotees of Pan, Greek god of fields and shepherds, garland his altar. This tapestry is from a set known as the Berain Grotesques, in reference to the pervasive stylistic influence of the artist Jean Berain (1640-1711), who may even have provided preliminary sketches. The Classical architecture, flora, fauna and figures against the blank ground was in emulation of the Roman wall-paintings excavated in the subterranean chambers of Nero's palace in Rome (erroneously called 'grotti', hence 'grotesques'.)  These Berain Grotesques tapestries’ light-hearted subject matter and whimsical design contrast with the heavier, ornate style that had characterized French tapestry during the preceding third quarter of the seventeenth century. The series enjoyed immense popularity during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and the Beauvais workshop produced many weavings for international clients.",'animal_fibre'

"This object is from the collection of Natalia de Shabelsky (1841-1905), a Russian noblewoman compelled to preserve what she perceived as the vanishing folk art traditions of her native country. Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments. Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.The embroidery of this piece does not appear to be religious work, and was likely made for secular use and later donated to the church.",'animal_fibre'

"British wool embroidery, known as crewel embroidery, was a nearly ubiquitous method of decorating furnishing textiles from the 16th through the 18th centuries. Wool could easily be dyed with the natural dyes of the period in a wide array of vivid colors. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, one of the most popular forms was variations on the Tree of Life motif, inspired by the colorful painted cotton palampores of the same design that were imported into Britain. This pair of bed curtain panels is exceptional for its unusual design, which is more closely related to woven silk textiles of the period. On this grand scale, the leaves also hark back to late medieval decorative cabbage-leaf verdure tapestries. The blue and white palette of the embroidery certainly reflects the immense popularity of the Chinese export and Dutch Delft ceramics that were avidly collected in Britain.These curtain panels would have formed part of a set of hangings, which would have also upper and lower valances, a head cloth, a bed cover or counterpane and wider curtains that would enclose the entire bed when drawn. As the hanging curtains often saw the least amount of physical wear, these are often the elements that survive from a matched set. In addition, the remainder of the textile furnishing in such a bedroom would have coordinated with the bed hangings: seat furniture covers, window curtains and possibly wall hangings.",'animal_fibre'
"The gilded moldings and carved decoration on this chair and a matching settee (acc. no. 1992.173.1) frame reverse-painted glass panels, which imitate in different colors the hardstones agate, marble, and lapis lazuli. Close inspection reveals the high quality and intriguingly delicate structure of the paint and the fragility of the panels, which is not evident at  first glance. That the chair and settee have survived in such good condition is testimony to the technical skills of the maker, who provided a sound base for the heavy glass strips, preventing them from peeling away over time. Nevertheless, these are display pieces that were clearly not intended for regular use. The smallest body movement of a user or any attempt to shift or lift the heavy objects puts divergent forces and pressure on their ostentatious ""skin.""The Museum's chair and settee are part of a large suite that originally consisted of at least four settees and twenty side chairs.[1] Early in the twentieth century the set was in the collection of the earl of Derby, at Derby House, London, from where it was sold in 1940 to Mrs. Violet van der Elst, also of London. The pieces were dispersed in 1948.[2] At that time, all items of the suite were covered with the bold red and gold baroque-cut velvet that still decorates the Museum's pieces. For many years it was assumed that the initials ""PPL"" displayed in a medallion on the backs referred to the Villa Palagonia in Bagheria, near Palermo, and, more specifically, to a member of the illustrious Gravina family as a patron;[3] however, as James David Draper pointed out, although ""the peculiarly Sicilian penchant for fashioning an overall look out of glass was most memorably given free rein at the Villa Palagonia, . . . the initials 'PPL' . . . do not correspond with those of any prince of Palagonia and in truth the pieces have a much more pronounced neo-classical severity than the Villa Palagonia ballroom.""[4]John Richardson, the donor of the Museum's pieces, which he had acquired on the London art market, kept them at one point in the Château de Castille in Provence, the home of the Cubist scholar Douglas Cooper,[5] who himself owned at least three chairs from the set.[6] For the moment, the original location of the suite remains a mystery, although the preciousness and labor-intensive nature of the work narrows the source of the commission to one of the great, prosperous, aristocratic families of Sicily.The back of the settee is tripartite; the medallion with initials appears at the top of the center section, but in the same place on the side sections there is a military trophy in the form of a helmet superimposed on a saber. There is a gilded openwork frieze of overlapping ellipses along the top of the back of both the chair and the settee; this appears also along the bottom of the back of the settee but not on the Museum's chair. These ellipses, rather freely adapted from ancient vase paintings, reflect the so-called Etruscan fashion of the last third of the eighteenth century.[7] A very similar pair of chairs, each, however, with an octagonal verre églomisé panel set into the back in place of upholstery, is part of the collection of Juan March Ordinas at Palau March in Palma de Mallorca.[8] That those panels show a mythological chariot in the manner of an ancient vase painting is also very much in the ""Etruscan"" style. The incorporation of glass panels in the center of the backs makes the March chairs even more fragile than the Derby House suite.[9]Other pieces from this suite are preserved in the Art Institute of Chicago (two chairs),[10] the Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida (two settees and two chairs),[11] and the Museum für Kunsthandwerk, Frankfurt am Main (one chair),[12] as well as in various private collections. Some of them have been recovered in shell pink or blue gray fabric with the intention of intensifying the effect of the same shades painted on the glass.[Wolfram Koeppe 2006]Footnotes:[1] Catalogue of a sale at Christie, Manson, and Woods, London, 26 July 1940, lot 41 (sold to Mrs. Violet van der Elst).[2] Catalogue of the Violet van der Elst collection sale, Christie, Manson, and Woods, London, 8 April 1948, lot 114 (ill.).[3] Allen Wardwell.

"On 31 October 1947 Duveen Brothers sold what the firm called ""The Marie Antoinette Set"" for 180,000 dollars to Samuel H. Kress (1863-1955). [1] It consisted of three embroidered wall hangings and various pieces of matched seat furniture that originally belonged to two different eighteenth-century suites, with the addition of several later pieces. [2] The wall hangings-chain-stitched embroideries in silk on a white silk-satin ground-show musical instruments, birds' nests, baskets of flowers, and sun hats linked together with swags of flowers. The present armchair and an identical example, as well as a pair of side chairs of the same design, have eighteenth-century show covers that were made to match these embroideries. In order to give the group of seat furniture a unified appearance, the remaining pieces were upholstered with portions cut from additional embroidered hangings that were sacrificed for this purpose.It is not entirely clear how such an illustrious provenance became attached to this assembled lot. When the settee, which dates to the nineteenth century, was published in 1927, nothing was said about its origin except, erroneously, that the eighteenth-century menuisier Georges Jacob had signed it. [3 In 1934, however, the author of a book on French furniture stated that the set had been made by Jacob for Marie Antoinette (1755-1793), and described it as ""one of the most beautiful examples of the talent of this master."" [4] Furthermore, he declared that the embroidery was the work of the queen and her ladies and that Marie Antoinette gave the entire set to Louis-Jean-Marie de Bourbon, duc de Penthièvre (1725-1793). [5]Stamped by Georges Jacob, who supplied much furniture to the court of Louis XVI (1754-1793), this armchair and its pair have straight, rectangular backs, which characterize them as fauteuils à la reine. When cutting the walnut frames, Jacob must have carefully taken into consideration the planned decoration, leaving enough wood to allow the unidentified but obviously very skilled carver to execute the designs. Particularly striking are the deeply undercut garlands of myrtle branches spiraling around a straight rod on the seat and back rails. Trails of berried myrtle branches are carved around the tapering shafts of the cylindrical legs, which are crowned by collars of laurel leaves and berries. Laurel leaves are also repeated on the front of the curving arm supports that terminate in acanthus-leaf volutes. A molding of pearls and twisted-rope motifs carved along the top of the seat rail gives a rhythmical effect not unlike that created by brass upholstery nails-here absent because the chairs are covered à châssis. The original slip seat and webbing have been preserved. The back panel, edge roll, arm pads, and comfortable down and feather seat cushion are all covered in the original late-eighteenth-century embroidered silk-satin. [6] The back displays floral branches framed by scrolling floral borders. The seat cushion shows a basket of flowers within similar borders. Certain motifs, such as the band of pearls along the fore edge of the seat as well as along the borders of the cushion and of the back, clearly relate to the carving of the wooden frame. The high quality of the once very colorful chain-stitched embroidery clearly identifies it as professional work rather than as the fruit of the queen's pastime. The elegant floral compositions are close to designs by the famed silk manufacturer Philippe de Lasalle (1723-1804/5).From a series of marks, inscriptions, and inventory numbers on the frames of both armchairs a considerable amount of information can be gleaned. [7] First of all, the incised roman numerals VII and VIII indicate that they were numbers seven and eight of a suite that included both arm- and side chairs, and possibly one or more settees. It was not unusual for a chairmaker to identify the various elements, especially such removable parts as slip seats and arm pads, as belonging to a certain chair, to avoid mixing them up.The French inscription ""de P[enthiè]vre Paris Chambre à Balus[tre]"" (and a variation of this) is enlightening as well, showing that the chairs were in the possession of the wealthy duc de Penthièvre, grand admiral of France and a cousin of Louis XVI. The set furnished his Paris residence, the Hôtel de Toulouse, an early-seventeenth-century building on the rue de la Vrillière, near the place des Victoires. By 1719 the architect Robert de Cotte (1656-1735) had renovated the mansion for the duc de Penthièvre's father, the comte de Toulouse.[8] The hôtel had, according to a late-eighteenth-century description, a chambre des balustres, or room with balustrade on the ground floor. [9] Used only on special occasions, this room was a chambre de parade, or ceremonial bedchamber. A curving balustrade, or estrade, seen in a plan by Jacques-François Blondel (1705-1774), closed off a bed alcove separating the state bed from the rest of the room . [10] To have such a balustrade was a privilege, allowed only in the state apartments of dukes, princes, and grands seigneurs. [11] The formal nature of the Museum's armchairs as so-called fauteuils meublants, placed along the wall and considered to be part of the interior decoration, reflects the official function of the room. Given the various other French inscriptions on the frames, it is possible that the chairs were also used in a different part of the house. It has been suggested that the entire set was placed in the first-floor apartment of the duke's widowed daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse-Louise, princesse de Lamballe (1749-1792), a friend of Marie Antoinette's. [12]After the duc de Penthièvre's death his only surviving daughter, Louise-Marie-Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre (1753-1821), inherited his possessions. Married to the liberal Louis-Philippe-Joseph, duc d'Orléans (1747-1793), who renounced his title and became known as Philippe-Égalité, she was widowed when he was guillotined during the Reign of Terror in 1793. She was exiled from France, and her property including the Hôtel de Penthièvre (Toulouse) was confiscated in 1797. The chairs may then have come into the possession of the banker Gabriel-Julien Ouvrard (1770-1846), whose name is written on stickers affixed to the slip seats. Having amassed a huge fortune in war speculations, Ouvrard became purveyor to the French navy in 1798. He apparently acquired several of the confiscated estates of the Orléans family that were, however, returned to them in 1814. The ""B125"" marks on the chairs probably refer to one of these properties, perhaps the eighteenth-century Château de Bizy, in Normandy, where the duc de Penthièvre died and his daughter lived after her return from exile. An inventory of the Château de Bizy described the Salon de Famille as furnished with hangings of white silk-satin embroidered with floral designs, and it listed a large set of seat furniture in the same room that was upholstered to match. This inventory was drawn up shortly after 1830, when the castle was in the possession of the son of Philippe-Égalité, Louis-Philippe (1773-1850), duc d'Orléans, who became king of France in 1830.The crowned, interlaced monogram ""LPO"" on the chairs clearly refers to his ownership, and he may have been responsible for uniting the two sets. It has been said that Louis-Philippe left the assembled seat furniture to his youngest daughter, Marie-Clémentine (1817-1907), who lived in Austria after her marriage to Prince Augustus of Saxe-Coburg. [13] Some years after her death, in September 1913, Duveen Brothers, the well-known antiques dealership with branches in London, Paris, and New York, acquired this set of furniture. [14]Notes:1 Duveen Brothers Records 1876-1981, Papers and Correspondence, 1901-81, box 475, f. 5 (microfilm, reel 330).2. In 1958 the pieces were a gift of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation to the Museum. They included two armchairs (acc. nos. 58.75.25,26) and two matching side chairs (58.75.33,34) all stamped by Georges Jacob. There were also two similar armchairs (58.75.30,31) and one small settee, or marquise (58.75.27), also by Jacob but part of another set. In addition, there were a settee (58.75.24), two armchairs (58.75.29,32), and a second marquise (58.75.28) executed at a later date to match the design of accession numbers 58.75.27,30,31. The wall hangings have the accession numbers 58.75.35-37. See Dauterman, Parker, and Standen 1964, pp. 61-75, nos. 7-9.3. Feulner 1927, p. 675, fig. 600.

"Textiles were rarely used as floor coverings in the late sixteenth century, except by the wealthiest individuals, but ""carpets"" of pile weaves, tapestry weaves, or embroidery were often used to decorate tables. This fragment of a large table carpet displays strapwork motifs typical of other English sixteenth-century decorative arts such as wood carving and plaster decoration, and the ripe fruits, flowers, and vegetables are varieties that often appear on embroidered objects of the period. These include Tudor roses, pomegranates, pears, squash, honeysuckle, and grapes.The somewhat awkward drawing of the armorials suggests that this was not the product of a professional workshop. The table carpet may have been an amateur or semi-professional production, perhaps made by servants and extended family members for use in their own home. However, this project was no small undertaking; when complete, the carpet might have measured as much as twelve to fifteen feet in length.",'animal_fibre'

Glossy taffetas like this were used in Europe as dress fabric and as wall hangings.",'animal_fibre'
"The pear-shaped lute slowly migrated from Central Asia into China during the Han and Sui dynasties (1st-7th century). It eventually became the pipa; the term describes the original playing motion of the plectrum held in the performer's right hand: p'i, ""to play forward"" (toward the left), and p'a, ""to play backward"" (toward the right). Until the mid-tenth century, the pipa was held horizontally (guitar style), and its twisted silk strings were plucked with a large triangular plectrum. Toward the end of the Tang dynasty, musicians began using their fingernails to execute the exuberant and programmatic repertory that was gaining popularity and that became the national style. To facilitate the use of the fingers, the instrument began to be held in a more upright position. In addition to its use in the opera and in storytelling ensembles, the pipa has a solo repertory of highly programmatic, virtuosic music. 	The spectacular back and sides of this unique Ming-dynasty instrument feature more than 110 hexagonal ivory plaques, with thinner bone plaques on the neck. Each plaque is carved with Taoist, Confucian, or Buddhist figures and symbols signifying prosperity, happiness, and good luck. These include images of various gods and immortals, such as Shou Lao, the Daoist god of longevity, who is shown with a prominent forehead on the single plaque at the very top. When the instrument is played, this expert workmanship remains unseen by the listener, as the back faces the player. The front is relatively plain but shows signs of use. The ivory string holder bears a scene featuring four figures and a bridge; an archaic cursive inscription; and, at the lip, a bat motif with leafy tendrils. Above the lower frets, two small insets depict a spider and a bird, and just before the rounded upper frets, a trapezoidal plaque portrays two men, one with a fish. The finial repeats the bat (good luck) motif.",'animal_fibre'

Cupid, leaning against the sail of the barge, aims an arrow at Antony, who is riding a spirited horse. The Latin inscription in the upper cartouche reads ""Antony, sent to compel her, is captured by love of her."" The exuberant style is typical of the tapestry designs of Justus van Egmont, who blended the dramatic figures of Rubens with a relish for billowing draperies and decorative details. Although the date of conception is unknown, sets of this design were being produced in Brussels from the early 1650s, and it evidently enjoyed considerable popularity. Several partial sets have survived, some numbering more than ten pieces.",'animal_fibre'

"The story of Jacob as depicted in this set of six tapestries (1983.73.1–.6) begins with the scene of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob (Gen. 25:29–34). Esau, the hunter, sits with his bow and quiver at his feet. He clasps hands with Jacob, his brother, who is clad in the starred robe that will identify him throughout the story. By this handshake Esau and Jacob seal their agreement, and the former accepts a bowl of food in exchange for his birthright as firstborn. The secondary scenes represent different moments in time and serve to advance the story. In the center distance Esau is shown hunting with two dogs. To the right, Rebecca, mother of Esau and Jacob, is seen cooking outside the tent, probably preparing food for Jacob to present o his father, Isaac (Gen. 27).

"The settees and chairs illustrated here (see 1974.356.114–.121) were made for the Franckenstein Pavilion in the gardens of Seehof Castle near Bamberg, one of the three summer residences in Southern Germany used by Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, prince bishop of Würzberg and Bamberg. A true garden enthusiast, it was under von Seinsheim that the gardens of Seehof were embellished, which must have resembled the still extant Rococo gardens completed by von Seinsheim at Veitshöchheim. His love for gardens and garden imagery also carried over into the interior decoration and furnishings of his castles, as the Seehof furniture demonstrates. A unique example of German Rococo furniture executed in a more flamboyant style than its French prototypes, the ensemble was designed specifically for the Garden Room in the Franckenstein Pavilion. Used as an audience room, it was referred to as the ""Green Trellis Chamber"" in the 1774 Seehof inventory and painted entirely with trompe l'oeil trellis and foliage. The garden room's furniture was made to match: the backs of the chairs and settees are richly carved in the form of garden trellis-work with colored flowers and foliage.",'animal_fibre'

"This miniature portrait of Charles I is one of the most technically accomplished examples of professional seventeenth-century needlework. In addition to this miniature, other examples include: two in the Victoria and Albert Museum, one in the Wallace Collection in London, one in Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, and one in the collection of John H. Bryan, which is housed in a silver-gilt frame engraved with the royal armorial and date of Charles’s execution, 30 January 1648 (old calendar). Like a painting in silk thread, this miniature represents the merging of two English artistic traditions—a naturalistic rendering of faces using fine techniques such as split stitch, which had been in use in England since the twelfth century, and the painted miniature portrait, a courtly fashion that began during the reign of Henry VIII.The king’s likeness has been taken with great fidelity from a 1641 etching by Wenceslaus Hollar, which was itself ultimately derived from a chain of different prints based on a painted portrait by Anthony van Dyck of Charles I and his consort, Henrietta Maria, painted in 1632. Oliver Millar has noted that van Dyck’s painting is in itself a reworking of the original composition by Daniel Mytens of ca. 1630-32, in the Royal Collection, Hampton Court Palace.The embroidery is contained within a glazed silver frame with molded edges and a suspension loop at the top, flanked on either side by a spiral ribbon cresting. The glass has beveled edges, and its various imperfections and minute air bubbles suggest that it is original to the period. An example of what Daphne Foskett calls a ""cabinet miniature,"" it was intended to be mounted in a cabinet or placed on a table.The bust of Charles is slightly raised from the flat gray-green satin background, an effect produced by the portrait’s having been stitched on satin. The king’s characteristic hairstyle, pointed beard, and upturned moustache are convincingly shaded in various tones of brown, brown-red, and light blond threads. Strands of hair are worked directly on the satin, with the raised portion skillfully merged into the background. The cheeks and jawline are also enhanced by shadowy tones that suggest both stubble and facial bone structure. Each thread is worked in a virtuoso technique that varies the stitch length, tension, and twist in such a way as to manipulate the play of light over the silk fibers. The intensity of detail can be grasped in a number of passages, such as Charles’s right eye, which is created from an amalgam of minute stitches. One can see under magnification that the lower lid is outlined by a minute pink thread, couched down, and worked over by a mass of flesh-toned silk. The iris is laid down in several shades of blue thread, separated from the black pupil by a lighter couching thread, which not only suggests depth by pulling the other threads around the pupil, but also creates the catch-light that defines Charles’s expression.The extraordinarily developed detail of this and the other, similar miniature portraits of the king led at one time to their being dated to the later eighteenth century, when interest in the cult of the martyred king was still strong. J.L. Nevinson, however, demonstrated the use of such techniques in other works that can be firmly placed in the period between 1650 and the end of the seventeenth century, including an embroidered bookbinding with a detailed portrait of a youth now in the Houghton Library at Harvard University that contains a copy of Hopkins’s Psalms dated 1648. It is likely then that the miniature was produced in the second half of the seventeenth century, either before or, as Nevinson posited, in the years immediately following the Restoration and is thus part of the imagery associated with the cult of the Royal Martyr.The link with the cult of Charles the Martyr is made explicit by the embroidered inscription, a quotation from Psalm 18, which associates Charles directly with the Old Testament patriarch King David: ""Deus meus est Rvpis mea Psa: 18."" The reference is to Psalm 18:2–3, which invokes God’s protection against his enemies: ""The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies."" Although the connection between contemporary monarchs and King David was a commonplace one, the specific association made here, of Charles I with the Psalms of King David, assumed a central importance in his posthumous cult. It drew from that most popular of all commemorative works, the literary ""self-portrait"" of the martyred king, the Eikon Basilike, a book notionally containing Charles Stuart’s own apologia for his life and reign, which, with its inclusion of the king’s favorite prayers and psalms, offered a kind of spiritual autobiography. Both the prayers and the meditations of the Eikon Basilike explicitly echo the Psalms of David. Indeed, the embroidered image is taken directly from a print that serves as the frontispiece of the Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae of 1651, an expanded edition of the king’s works with a bound-in 1649 version of the Eikon Basilike. As Elizabeth Wheeler has shown, the ""repeated evocation of the Psalms, the emphasis on conscience, the insistence on the depth and sorrow of his sufferings"" found in this work all presented a figure intimately accessible to ordinary laymen and women.This intimacy was reflected in small-scale portraits like the present example and other small commemorative objects that were made in the years immediately after the king’s execution. They reflect, too, the peculiarly private aspect of mourning for the king that characterized the ten-year period before the Restoration, during which time there were few permitted outlets for public grief. As Lois Potter has suggested, this circumstance conditioned the nature of the ensuing cult of the martyred king and in particular stimulated the production of such small, intimate kinds of memorial art. The inclusion of the scriptural inscription explicitly offered up the image of the martyred king as a spiritual model. The tradition that the monarch’s own hair was worked into the image would have further emphasized the character of a relic. A number of such objects are recorded in the former collection of Percival D. Griffiths. A poem by Jeremiah Wells (1646–1679), written in reaction to an analogous small-scale portrait of Charles drawn in ink on parchment, which he saw in the library of St. John’s College, Oxford, in 1665, vividly conveys the ecstatic emotions such portraits could summon up. In the latter portrait, the identification of Charles with King David is made literally indelible, for the lines of the face and hair are rendered in minute script that supposedly contain the whole Book of Psalms, or at least the Penitential Psalms. In a manuscript draft of the poem (later amended), Wells begins: ""Wash thy impure feet, and trembling trace / With wary steps this more than sacred place."" The first stanza of the published version continues in similarly hyperbolic fashion, mystically equating the king’s body with the divine word:""With double reverence we approach to lookOn what’s at once a picture and a book:Nor think it Superstition to adoreA king made now more sacred then before . . .The object here’s Majestick and divine,Divinity does Majesty enshrine . . .""A portrait of the playwright Thomas Killigrew, painted by William Shephard one year after the king’s execution, when Killigrew was in Venice as the political agent of the exiled Charles II, provides visual evidence, similarly rhetorical, as to how such images of the king were used. Killigrew sits at his desk with a (somewhat larger) portrait of Charles I on the wall behind him. He adopts a classic attitude of melancholy, which in other circumstances might have signified merely his own creative temperament, but which in this context may be taken to connote a stoical, philosophical grief for the executed king. His loyalty to the Stuart cause is further underlined by the copy of the Eikon Basilike that lies beneath the pile of his own plays. It is easy to imagine the embroidered portrait miniature eliciting similar kinds of response.[Jonathan Tavares and Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'
"Woven and embroidered textiles commissioned by noble families were among the most expensive expressions of wealth and power during the Renaissance. The production of luxurious silks was tightly regulated in order to ensure quality, and the movements of weavers were sometimes restricted to prevent the loss of technical and artistic advantages to rival city-states such as Venice, Milan, and Genoa. This stylized floral velvet is woven with a variation on a motif found in the Medici family coat of arms: the seven balls called palle (here, in the center of the largest flower). The placement of the red velvet circles on a background of golden thread draws attention to this feature. The original use of these fragments is not known; they might have been part of a liturgical vestment or a secular fragment.",'animal_fibre'

"This tapestry is from a set depicting scenes from the story of Diana probably made for the château of Anet, about forty miles west of Paris, which was the chief residence of Henry II's mistress, Diane de Poitiers. She herself, born in 1499, was named after the goddess, a sign that the Renaissance, with its emulation of classical antiquity, had come to France.The inscription in French verse on the upper border of the tapestry tells the story depicted:Britomartis, pursued by Minos, who wished to take her by force in the woods, greatly preferred to end her life in the sea rather than submit to his outrageous will. Accordingly, wishing to give her fame for her death, Phoebe [Diana] invested fishnets and snares, with which the body was brought to a holy place, and since then the Greeks have called her Dictynna [""fishnet""]. O holy death, that gave such a valuable thing to the world by means of such a misfortune!Diana stands in the center of the tapestry, a crescent on a support above her forehead. To the right, the drowning Britomartis raises one hand above the water. In the middle distance, Minos, king of Crete, stands looking into the water with his arms raised in astonishment, while Britomartis' body is being fished out of the water to the right. In the left background we see Minos pursuing Britomartis, and farther back, to the right, Diana hands a net to two men.The version of the story shown here is not precisely that found in the writings of any classical author, and the invention of the net by Diana does not seem to be a classical idea at all. It is here in order to glorify Diane de Poitiers, who is portrayed in the guise of the goddess.

"This portrait is worked with large stitches that mimic engraved or etched cross-hatchings, which, along with the framing device, link the portrait to the print medium from which it is derived. This graphic effect is particularly apparent in the brick stitch used as the ground in the border around the oval frame. It is unusual that the embroiderer has adopted the printmakers’ and painters’ convention of signing his work at the bottom of the image: ""R. Hayes Fecit."" This claim to professional status makes it likely that R. Hayes was indeed a professional embroiderer, and this is consistent with the evenness of stitching. It is most evident in the rendering of Charles’s flowing hair, where the embroiderer has articulated the graceful ringlets by twisting the silk floss at the tips of the gathered curl to create a play of light that closely approaches the nature of human hair.The embroidery is derived from a popular image of Charles I, which was made after his execution and exists in at least two prints: an engraving by Edward Bower, published by Robert Preeke in 1649, and an etching produced by Wenceslaus Hollar in the same year (MMA, 17.50.85). Although Yvonne Hackenbroch suggests the former as the direct print source for this embroidery, it is in fact closer to the Hollar version, in the exact transcription of the pose, in the king’s size and position relative to the oval surround, and in such details as the gloved hand and the cloak embroidered with the emblem of the Order of the Garter. John Peacock has posited that the Hollar portrait drew upon the painted portrait of Charles I Wearing the Garter Star of about 1632 by Anthony van Dyck and an ""idiosyncratic"" etching of Charles I by George Lid, published as a frontispiece of A Continuation of Lucan of 1630. From the former, he derived the general disposition of pose and details of costume, including the emblazoned Garter Star, and from the latter, the idea of showing the king wearing a broad-brimmed hat. That Charles wears the hat in several posthumous prints and in the embroidered portrait is a probable reference to his attire in court, when, as Hackenbroch pointed out, ""Charles declined to take his hat off during the trials lest this gesture be interpreted as a sign of respect towards his Judges."" In the embroidered portrait, this reference, combined with an aureole of light emanating from behind him, confers upon the image of the king both the specificity of an historical memory and an iconic aura appropriate to its commemorative function.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'

"The first part of the 18th century was a particularly fruitful and distinctive period in the history of British design for the silk weaving industry. Anna Maria Garthwaite (1690–1763) is the designer mostly closely associated with this period due to the survival of her design drawings, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Though this pattern does not match any of the published Garthwaite designs, it has much in common with her compositions of carefully observed flowers and plants arranged on a pale foundation color. The species illustrated on this silk panel include tulips, roses, chrysanthemums and holly.The floral silks produced in the Spitalfields area of east London during this period provide a provocative comparison with British porcelains of the same period. A set of plates made by the Chelsea Porcelain Manufactory in the 1750s (2016.217–.229) display the same interest in contemporary botanical illustration as do the silk designs. Several silk designers of the first half of the 18th century are known to have studied botany or natural history. In this climate of intellectual curiosity, creators of both porcelain and silk designs found inspiration to create works that are uniquely British.",'animal_fibre'

"The story of Jacob as depicted in this set of six tapestries (1983.73.1–.6) begins with the scene of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob (Gen. 25:29–34). Esau, the hunter, sits with his bow and quiver at his feet. He clasps hands with Jacob, his brother, who is clad in the starred robe that will identify him throughout the story. By this handshake Esau and Jacob seal their agreement, and the former accepts a bowl of food in exchange for his birthright as firstborn. The secondary scenes represent different moments in time and serve to advance the story. In the center distance Esau is shown hunting with two dogs. To the right, Rebecca, mother of Esau and Jacob, is seen cooking outside the tent, probably preparing food for Jacob to present o his father, Isaac (Gen. 27). The narrative continues to unfold in the other tapestries, which depict Rachel giving her servant Bilhah to Jacob (Gen. 30:1–4), Rachel and Bilhah with her son Dan, and Jacob making a covenant with his father-in-law",'animal_fibre'

"With the distinctive long, low format of a wainscot tapestry, this hanging can be attributed with confidence to weavers working in the great Flemish city of Bruges, who since the mid-fifteenth century had sought to distinguish themselves from the massive, monumental narrative and allegorical wall hangings perfected by Brussels weavers, by specializing in armorial tapestries against mille-fleurs grounds, as well as in similarly formatted choir tapestries. As experienced in this tapestry, by the mid-sixteenth century Bruges’ cartoon designers and weavers updated conventional flower-strewn mille-fleurs by developing a warmer palette and by massing the flowers so closely together that the dark blank ground is almost obscured. The floral pattern becomes a glorious, abstract mass of dappling color; in technique, daring weaving styles like eccentric wefts (which deviate in thin sinuous lines from the regular grid of the warp and weft) are manipulated to represent the stems and lower leaves of the plants. Wainscot tapestries were particularly popular amongst English clientele (Antwerp weavers called them “op Engelse wijze”- ‘English style’) and on the Italian peninsula, where they were in high demand as “spaliere” to hang over cassone chests. Although the armorials suspended within the three garlanded landscape cartouches have not yet been identified, it is likely they are associated with one of the Florentine, Genovese, Venetian or Lucchese families connected with the Bruges’ markets through trade and banking.",'animal_fibre'

Featuring genre figures in idealized landscapes, they provided a lighthearted contrast to the grander history and mythology tapestries then in vogue for the staterooms of European country houses.

"The settees and chairs illustrated here (see 1974.356.114–.121) were made for the Franckenstein Pavilion in the gardens of Seehof Castle near Bamberg, one of the three summer residences in Southern Germany used by Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, prince bishop of Würzberg and Bamberg. A true garden enthusiast, it was under von Seinsheim that the gardens of Seehof were embellished, which must have resembled the still extant Rococo gardens completed by von Seinsheim at Veitshöchheim. His love for gardens and garden imagery also carried over into the interior decoration and furnishings of his castles, as the Seehof furniture demonstrates. A unique example of German Rococo furniture executed in a more flamboyant style than its French prototypes, the ensemble was designed specifically for the Garden Room in the Franckenstein Pavilion. Used as an audience room, it was referred to as the ""Green Trellis Chamber"" in the 1774 Seehof inventory and painted entirely with trompe l'oeil trellis and foliage.

"This needlepoint hanging depicts a scene from the Tabula Cebetis (The Table of Cebes), a treatise long wrongly believed to have been written by Socrates' disciple Cebes that enjoyed great popularity as a Latin reader in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  The text describes a painting displayed in the Temple of Saturn in Thebes that showed the journey through life and the pathway to true happiness. This hanging depicts the penultimate episode in the journey: the protagonist is beckoned from his path by a woman representing False Learning. Elegant figures in courtly dress are distracted from true wisdom and happiness by dedicating too much energy to the pursuit of knowledge through debate, philosophy, geometry, astrology and alchemy, geography, astronomy, arithmetic, and music.This hanging is one of a set of three (the others are in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris and the Metropolitan Museum). Their design was adapted from a woodcut illustrating The Table of Cebes made by David Kandel of Strasbourg in 1547. Notwithstanding the difference in scale (the woodcut is just over 12 by 15 inches), the designer of the embroidery borrowed the principal figures from the woodcut's central scene, inventively adding a warm palette of greens, reds, and yellows. The whole is enclosed by an imaginative border of cavorting grotesques and includes the coat of arms of the De Fenis de Prade family surrounded by the collar of the Order of Saint Michael (upper left) and a second unidentified armorial enclosed by a widow's cordeliere (upper right).

"In the early modern period, gloves were essential accessories. As today, they had practical functions: they were used for protection or warmth, and, in some cases, perfumed gloves were used for medical purposes. Yet they were also potent extensions of social actions; they were symbols of status and obligation, thrown down in challenge or treasured as tokens of affection. In this way, gloves were a conspicuous pleasure—in paintings, they are frequently held rather than worn. This pair features preening birds of paradise, carnations, roses, and tiny borages—possibly inspired by those in La Clef des Champs (1586) and A schole-house, for the needle (1632)—and set within arabesques. The tabbed, gauntlet-style was popular for displaying elaborate, expensive professional embroidery, as the tabs are slightly gusseted to fit over the wearer’s intricate lace cuffs. The wide cuff also complemented the long, tapering fingers that extend beyond the fingertips, lengthening the hand and emphasizing exemption from manual work. And, of course, the metallic embellishments would have brilliantly glimmered in the light. -Sarah Bochicchio, 2020",'animal_fibre'
"A symbol of exoticism and power, the Asian elephant (identified by its small ears) shares the visual space of this finely patterned silk satin damask with a European double-headed crowned eagle beneath a stylized, oval-shaped lotus.¹ The elephant is shown with multiple tusks, three on one side and one peeking out on the other. As such, the animal seen here likely represents the Buddhist six-tusked elephant described in a fifth-century Chinese translation of a sutra as being resplendent and white and having lotuses, jade maidens, and other symbolic figures at the end of each tusk.²Elephants have a long history in China. Given as tribute to the emperor by local rulers, particularly from neighboring Southeast Asian regions where they were raised, elephants were also presented as diplomatic gifts to important foreign kings. Apart from their use as work animals and army transport, they were sometimes tamed to provide entertainment in times of leisure, beloved by the royal courts. In sixteenth-century Europe, elephants held a similar fascination for royals and commoners alike, and they appear in the works of such artists as Durer and Raphael. Shipped by boat from Ceylon to Lisbon, elephants were offered as gifts of the Portuguese kings to the courts of Spain, Austria, France, and England. In 1514, Manuel I of Portugal gave a white elephant (the famous ""Hanno"" known through Raphael's drawings) to Pope Leo X.  An  elephant given by the court of Lisbon to Philip II of Spain in 1581 was subsequently passed along to Henry IV of France.  A year later Henry, in turn, gve it to Queen Elizabeth of England, a brillia;nt ""re-gifting"" of an asset deemed too expensive to maintain.³ Here the combination of Buddhist symbols and Habsburg eagles produces a composite message of a religious and political nature that juxtaposes the two cultures of Asia and Europe.  We do not know how long this long-preserved length of fabric was originally used, but its delicate quality indicates that it may have been part of a garment or hanging.⁴Woven in China and likely exported through the port of Macau, this textile's blend of Asian and European taste and style was intended for a foreign market that may not have understood the Buddhist elements but nonetheless would have appreciated the fine weaving and exotic designs.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1. The textile is composed of a five-harness satin damask, with a blue warp and yellow weft.

At the ends of his six tusks are six bathing tanks, in each of which grow fourteen lotuses. On each open blossom is a ‘jade maiden’ fairer than the damsels of Paradise, in whose hands are five spontaneously created lutes; each lute is accompanied by 500 other musical instruments, and 500 jewel-colored birds.” Guan Puxian pu sa xing fa jing (Sutra on the Practice of Visualizing the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra), in Soper, “Literary Evidence for Early Buddhist Art in China,” p. 223. 3.

A fragment of the white selvage with a blue stripe is preserved along the seam in two areas (visible at the back). Digby, “Some Silks Woven under Portuguese Influence in the Far East,” pp. 55 ? 56 and n. 11, notes that several Asian damasks from Macau have a white twill selvage with a stripe and that the structure of this selvage is distinct from other silks thought to be from Macau; the elephant silk conforms to the technical features of that group.

The selvages at left and right are preserved, and the top and bottom have been trimmed only slightly.  In its present form, with the scene almost complete and its shimmering silks still remarkably vibrant, it can be appreciated in much the same way as a Netherlandish panel painting—a medium with which it shares many compositional and iconographic aspects.

"This tapestry is one from a nine-piece series known as the Hunters’ Chase. Curiously-enough, given its secular subject-matter, the original edition was commissioned by the Dutch Church in London, in 1645.

Hunters’ Chase proved incredibly popular for Mortlake, resulting in much-needed commissions for the floundering manufactory: at least 8 different re-editions were woven during the following decades, including that of which this News of the Stag was part.For more info see Edith Standen, European post-medieval tapestries and related hangings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1985 (vol.2, cat.125) and Wendy Hefford in Tapestry in the Baroque: Threads of Splendor, MMA exh.cat. 2007 (p.182).",'animal_fibre'

"This richly decorated burse was made to contain the king’s Great Seal. It was part of the insignia of office of its custodian, the Keeper of the Great Seal (a post often contained within that of the Lord High Chancellor) and one of the most elaborate symbols associated with that high office. The king’s Great Seal was attached to all writs, letters patent, charters, and royal proclamations and was the ultimate symbol of royal authority. Something of the aura that attached to the physical object may be seen in the sense of responsibility its keepers felt in its safekeeping. When a Thomas Sadler broke into the house of the chancellor, Lord Finch, and stole the mace and burse on February 7, 1677, he failed to take the Great Seal itself, as Lord Finch kept it under his pillow.The present example dates from the reign of the first Hanoverian king, George I, and although the coat of arms would be particular to each monarch, the general form and decoration had been established earlier. A portrait of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, dated 1579 and housed in a private collection, shows him with an embroidered burse heavy with metal thread on a red velvet ground, with the monarch’s coat of arms and initials, foliate borders, and applied tassels, which is the same in essence as the Hanoverian example. The burse of Elizabeth I’s last Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Sir Thomas Egerton (appointed 1596–1603), which is today in the British Museum, is also centered by the queen’s coat of arms flanked by a lion and a Welsh dragon rampant, surmounted by the letters E.R. and bordered by scrolling foliage. This pattern was followed in succeeding examples, evident in the burse held by Sir Orlandus Bridgeman, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal between 1667 and 1672, in the engraving by William Faithorne. One of the ceremonial uses of the burse was to be carried in procession at shoulder height by the Lord High Chancellor preceding the monarch. The burse of Francis North, Baron Guildford (1637–1685), appointed Lord Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal in 1682, survives today in the Burrell Collection.Given its symbolic purpose, the burse was made from the finest and most precious of materials by royal embroiderers and therefore represents the pinnacle of professional embroidery of the period. As such, it displays a veritable catalogue of different uses of metal thread, couching techniques, and appliqué. These techniques are also to be found on heralds’ tabards, robes of state, and other greater and lesser articles of ceremony, and were used in varying levels of detail, relief, and material according to a judicious hierarchy of workmanship that was attached to works made for court ceremonial. The embroidery is almost sculptural in character. The applied raised work in high relief is well dispersed throughout the composition of the square bag, comprising the main decorative elements: the Royal Hanoverian coat of arms at the center, the lion and unicorn rampant on plinths, an orb at the bottom center, and winged putti’s heads punctuating the corners and middle of the sides of the border. All of these elements are composed of couched metal threads of varying width, tone, and form to create a variety of contrasting textures. The colors are concentrated around a palette of gold, silver, and crimson, traditionally associated with English royalty since the time of William the Conqueror (whose arms are included on the first half of the upper left quartering of the coat of arms on the burse, the ""three lions passant gardant or""). The texture achieved by virtue of tightly coiled silver purl in the unicorn’s muzzle or the sinuous undulating ribcage of the lion’s chest demonstrates the skill in manipulating metal threads to give the impression of the natural fall of groomed fur.The arms themselves are those of King George I. To the existing royal arms of the quartered fleurs-de-lis of France, rampant red lion of Scotland, lions passant of England, and harp of Ireland, the Hanoverian arms have been included in the lower left quadrant: two lions passant for Brunswick, harts and a blue lion rampant for Lüneburg, and a white or silver horse for Westphalia. Over this is a diminutive escutcheon with the crown of Charlemagne, an emblem associated with George I’s title as Arch-Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire. In the course of his reign, George I appointed three Lord High Chancellors, and so there are three possible possessors of this burse: William Cowper, 1st Baron Talbot of Hensol (1714–18), Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke (1718–25), and Peter King, 1st Baron King (1725–33). The extravagant three-dimensionality of the burse shows the continued flourishing of professional embroidery at court into the eighteenth century.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'
"The imagery of this panel is unusual in that it juxtaposes King Charles I and his consort, Henrietta Maria, with Adam and Eve beneath the Tree of Knowledge. To some extent, the panel can be classified with other commonly occurring images of the royal couple in contemporary embroidery. These appear to have been primarily celebratory or commemorative in nature, but the direct association made here between contemporary royalty and Adam and Eve is unique among surviving embroidered pictures, indeed among the images of royalty in every medium. It therefore has significance within the wider field of royal iconography of the Caroline era.The embroidery can be dated to a time after 1634, because the poses of Charles I and Henrietta Maria are derived from an engraving by Robert van Voerst first published in that year. The print shows Charles and Henrietta Maria exchanging olive and laurel branches, emblems of peace and military glory, and it celebrates their marriage and the political advantages that accrued from it. The print is a copy of the painting by Anthony van Dyck of 1632, which itself is a reworking of an original by Daniel Mytens of ca. 1630–32.This association between royal marriage and royal authority is carried over into the embroidery, although apart from the poses of the royal couple, it retains little of the symbolism of its prototype. In place of the exchange of olive and laurel branches between the royal couple, Henrietta Maria offers her husband a flower, while Charles holds a sword and scepter, the symbols of worldly dominion. The association of the royal marriage and Charles’s symbols of monarchy with Adam and Eve, the first married couple, carries the suggestion that Charles’s claim to royal authority rests on a chain of royal—specifically familial—descent stretching back to the Fall and even before that, to humankind’s state of innocence. Such a juxtaposition would have resonated in the 1630s and 1640s with the political debates that raged over the nature of political authority. In these debates, the varied justifications for political organization, whether Royalist, Parliamentarian, or Leveller, were invariably based on some understanding of Adamic patriarchy and the first marriage. For all political complexions, the concept of Paradise that had once existed in some place and time provided the key to the way in which ideal social relations once were and should still be.The theme of the panel appears to be an explicit reflection of the Royalist argument, which saw Adamic patriarchy as the basis of the divine right of kings. In The Glasse of Time (1620), Thomas Peyton described James I as ""A royall King deriued from the race, / O f Edens Monarch in her greatest grace, / Within whose face true Maiesty doth shine."" According to Richard Cumberland, a friend of Samuel Pepys, ""Humankind, and by consequence, all Societies and Families sprang from the matrimonial Union of one Man with one Woman. And, consequently, all Civil Government is originally laid out in a natural Parental Authority"" (De Legibus Naturae, 1672). Such arguments and their counter-arguments, which maintained that the right to govern derived from the consent of the people, were furiously debated during the crisis of Parliament and the Civil War years of the 1640s. John Maxwell, chaplain to Charles I, argued in Sacro-Sancta Regum Majestas (1644) that monarchy was fixed by God in the time before the Fall. ""Can we be so stupid as to acknowledge the dominion over all creatures below is given to man immediately by God, and to deny that the most noble and excellent Government by which man hath Power and Empire over men is not from God . . . but by Compact and Contract, the Composition and Constitution of men?"" Sir Robert Filmer, in his Patriarcha: or, The Natural Right of Kings (probably written about 1630, but not published until 1680), justified monarchy on hereditary grounds—that Adam and the patriarchs after him had royal authority over their children by right of fatherhood, and that this authority had been given to them by God. ""The first Father had not only simply power, but power monarchical, as he was a Father immediately from God. For by the appointment of God, as soon as Adam was created he was monarch of the world, though he had no subjects."" For Filmer, Adam’s was ""[a]s large and ample as the Absolutest Dominion of any Monarch which hath been since the Creation.""Such views reached the popular domain via sermons and pamphlets. John Evelyn recorded in a diary entry of May 1678 having heard a sermon that argued for the monarchical over all other systems of government, ""& that from Adam (to whom God had given the Empire of all things & Persons) that it seemed to be not onely of divine, but most natural institution."" And on January 30, 1694, the anniversary of the death of Charles I, Evelyn heard a young man preach on the ""Excellency of Kingly Government above all other, deriving it from Adam, The Patriarchs, God himselfe."" The panel therefore shows an embroiderer directly engaged in these debates, asserting sympathy for the Royalist cause. As such, it shows the expressive freedom of the embroidery medium, which because of its relatively private nature allowed its makers to react personally to events and to create images encompassing themes that lay outside and beyond the iconographical norms of public art, both popular prints and the more exclusive iconography of the court.[Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'

The 1601 inventory of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury (1527—1608), included two quilts that were almost certainly products of this trade: ""a quilt of yellow India stuff embroidered with birds and beasts"" and ""a quilt of India stuff embroidered with beastes.""¹ Indian quilts of the type produced for the Portuguese market appeared with increasing frequency in London sales into the 1620s, when their value began to decline, perhaps because of diminishing novelty.²The taste for Indian-style embroidery remained, however, and it is interesting to note that the English maker of another bedcover in the Museum's collection (MMA 34.104.1) used not only the Indian palette of golden yellow on white but also an imported Indian cotton as the foundation. The cover has rare seventeenth-century marks on the plain-weave cotton fabric: the initials G.C.E. (for the English East India Company's original name, The Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies) as well as three other stamps whose significance has not yet been deciphered.³ On that bedcover, the embroidered designs draw heavily on such exotic motifs as pineapple-like vegetation and serrated leaves, but contemporary European sensibilities are also evident in the strapwork connecting the floral elements. Additionally, the three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the use of stitches with long floats that create a shinier surface to contrast with the matte appearance of the cotton ground diverge from the Indian prototypes, whose flatter chain stitches are less glossy. English bedcovers were usually part of coordinated sets that could include bolsters, pillows, and matching valances.⁴In addition to the more common monochrome yellow-on white embroideries, Indian polychrome embroideries also arrived in England during the early seventeenth century. They, too, are described in sale records; for example, a 1614 sale included ""a carpet or quilt embroidered upon calico with sundry silks.""⁵ The word ""carpet"" is probably used in its contemporaneous sense, that is, to signify decorative covers for a variety of furniture types, including beds. This textile, an English polychrome silk and metal-thread bedcover, is more obviously dependent on the stylistic composition of Persian and Turkish carpets than MMA 34.104.1.  By the eighteenth century, both embroidered and painted cotton textiles of this type, with a central medallion and smaller medallions in the corners of the central field, were being made in India for domestic consumption and for export (see e.g. Winterthur Museum no. 1963.0048 and Victoria and Albert Museum no. IS.46-1956).⁶ These imported polychrome covers had a lasting influence on the production of English embroidered bed furnishings of the eighteenth century.

"Working an embroidered maps such as this sampler became part of a young girl’s education, starting in the 1770s, and continuing until about the 1840s. The map of England and Wales was so popular that printed versions were available to be stitched, which slightly reduces the potential for learning geography, while retaining the importance of practicing neat embroidery.

The designs for all eight tapestries were inspired in part upon drawings then in Louis XIV's collection- now preserved in the Louvre- which were all, at that time, attributed to Raphael.

"In an intriguing conceit, a portrait, as if painted on a framed panel, is displayed within this woven scene, actually represented in the silks and woolen threads of tapestry. Despite its considerable size, this is a fragment cut from an even larger narrative tapestry of monumental scale. As such, the subject matter remains frustratingly opaque. Given the rich interior and courtly, contemporary fashions worn by the protagonists, past scholars have been tempted to identify this as a record of an actual historical event. It has been suggested, for example, as recording Margaret of Austria showing a portrait of her fiancé, Philibert II, Duke of Savoy, to her father, Emperor Maximilian I, before their 1501 marriage. Given the sixteenth-century convention to portray the protagonists of ancient, classical and Biblical histories- all popular in tapestry- in embellished versions of contemporary dress, however, this could more likely be a scene from such a fictive, and as yet unidentified, history.",'animal_fibre'
"The Danish statesman of German origin Baron Johann Hartwig Ernst Bernstorff (1712-1772) remarked about King Frederick V of Denmark (1723-1766) that he ""loved France with a passion.""¹ The same could be said of Bernstorff, who was a true Francophile and was credited with speaking the language better than many French people.² During his tenure as Danish ambassador at the court of Versailles, from 1744 until 1751, Bernstorff developed a marked preference for the arts of France and lived in a beautifully furnished hôtel in the rue Bourbon in Paris.³ In 1752, not long after he was recalled to Copenhagen to assume the post of minister of foreign affairs, Bernstorff began building a grand town house in a new part of the city named Frederiksstaden, after the king. Although the exterior of the house, designed by Johann Gottfried Rosenberg (ca. 1709-1776), betrays German influence, the interior decoration was according to the latest French taste.  Particularly beautiful was the tapestry room on the main floor, embellished with four hangings from the series Les Amours des Dieux (The Loves of the Gods). Woven of wool and silk at the Beauvais Manufactory in 1754, after designs by the painter François Boucher (1703-1770), these tapestries were commissioned for Bernstorff by his friend the collector Louis-Antoine Crozat, Baron de Thiers (1700-1770), who acted as his representative in France.⁴ To complement these tapestries, a set of twelve chair backs, seats, and matching armrests as well as the covers for two settees were woven at the same time.⁵ The set of wall hangings and the tapestry-covered seat furniture -- two settees and twelve armchairs -- were shipped to Copenhagen and installed in 1756. A marble fireplace and overmantel mirror as well as three pier glasses and three console tables were also made in France for this room, as were the gilt-bronze three-light candelabra signed by François-Thomas Germain (1726-1791) and based on designs by Pierre Contant d'Ivry (1698-1777).⁶ The splendid carved and gilded armchairs and settees that were arranged against the walls of the room must have formed an important element of the decoration, which was described by Baron de Thiers as ""satisfying our ultimate conception of exquisite luxury.""⁷  The frames of the seat furniture were made by the Parisian joiner Nicolas-Quinibert Foliot, who stamped eight of the chairs and one of the settees. Established in the rue de Cléry, just like his father, Nicolas Foliot (ca. 1675-1740), whom he succeeded as menuisier du Garde-Meuble du Roi, the younger Foliot supplied many pieces to the court. Characteristic of his furniture is the somewhat massive, undulating outline of the chairs in this set, enlivened by symmetrically placed Rococo ornament such as the floral garlands, palm branches, and stylized leaves, which are gadrooned. A prominent shell motif forms the center of the back rail on both the chairs and the settees. Supported on cabriole legs, the feet are elegantly adorned with a large flower head. The set is upholstered à châssis, with removable tapestry seats, armrests, and backs, displaying colorful compositions of birds and animals in landscapes after designs by the painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686-1755), codirector of the Beauvais Manufactory from 1734 until his death.⁸ Yellow and brown symmetrical borders of scrolling foliage and rocaille motifs surround these scenes that clearly reflect the outline of the seat furniture, creating a beautiful harmony between the woven covers and the carved and gilded wooden frames.  The tapestry room remained intact until the beginning of the twentieth century, despite the vicissitudes of Bernstorff's house after his death. He bequeathed it to his nephew Andreas Peter Bernstorff (1735-1797), who, like his uncle, served as foreign minister of Denmark.⁹ The property was sold by his son to developers. It was divided and later reunited, and in 1829 became the residence of Prince Frederick Ferdinand (1792-1863) and his bride, Princess Caroline (1793-1881), the eldest daughter of the Danish King Frederick VI. There were renovations to the palace, but the tapestry room was left unaltered and the seat furniture was listed as in situ in the inventory drawn up during that same year.¹⁰ The widowed Princess Caroline remained in the house until the end of her life. The next owner of the Bernstorff palace was King George I of the Hellenes (1845-1913), the second son of King Christian IX of Denmark (1818-1906), who stayed there during visits to his country of birth. It was during this time that the crowned-G mark was branded into the wood of the furniture seats, identifying the pieces as his property. George I sold the seat furniture and the tapestries separately, early in the twentieth century. By 1902 the American financier and collector J. Pierpont Morgan (1837-1913) had acquired the Foliot chairs and settees from the London dealer Charles Wertheimer.¹¹ Morgan kept the set with most of the rest of his collection at his London town house to avoid paying United States import duties on artworks more than one hundred years old. Much to their surprise, Queen Alexandra of England (1844-1925) and her sister Dowager Empress Marie of Russia (1847-1928), both Danish princesses, recognized the seat furniture during a visit in 1908 as having belonged to their brother George I.¹² After the tariff was lifted, the suite was shipped to New York as a loan to the exhibition of Morgan's collection held at the Museum in 1912. Morgan died the next year, and, in 1915, following the exhibition, the furniture was returned to his heirs, who sold the settees and chairs to the New York art dealership Duveen Brothers. Presumably hoping to make a double profit, Joseph Duveen (1869-1939) had the tapestry covers removed from their eighteenth-century frames and fitted on Louis XV-style chairs and settees that were specifically made for this purpose by Carlhian et Cie, the Parisian decorating firm of Paul Carlhian and his brother André.¹³In 1919, assuming he was acquiring antique furniture, one of Duveen's regular clients, the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. (1874-1960) agreed to purchase, for the staggering sum of 650,000 dollars, what was in fact a set of twelve reproduction chairs and two reproduction settees with the Beauvais covers from the Bernstorff tapestry room.¹⁴The seat furniture was included in this condition in the Metropolitan Museum's fiftieth-anniversary exhibition the next year.  The original pieces of furniture received modern upholstery, and half of the set was sold; the other half remained with the dealer. Only in 1948 was it discovered that the frames of the seat furniture in the Rockefeller collection were new, and a thoroughgoing effort was made to locate the eighteenth-century frames. In 1951 six of the original chairs and one settee were found in the Duveen Brothers warehouse, and the remaining half of the set turned up in 1965 at the Gothic Revival-style manor house Lyndhurst, in Tarrytown, New York. The last owner of this house had been Anna, duchess of Talleyrand-Périgord (1875-1961), the youngest daughter of the railroad magnate Jay Gould (1836-1892), who was an avid collector of French furniture.¹⁵ Having subsequently been acquired for the Rockefellers, the entire suite of seat furniture and tapestry covers eventually came into the possession of the Museum.¹⁶ Clothed once again in their original upholstery, the armchairs and settees serve as excellent reminders of the fact that French furniture was widely admired during the eighteenth century and served as elegant furnishings for residences all over Europe.

"Images of gardens were popular in the tapestry medium from the medieval era, where the so-called mille-fleurs (thousand flowers) (see also 2013.506) provided a decorative, and sometimes symbolic, setting for scenes of romance and play. Park and garden tapestries continued to enjoy popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly for the decoration of more intimate chambers, where they provided a pleasant contrast with the grander subject matter of tapestries used in more formal settings. The theme enjoyed new popularity with the advent of the Rococo style during the eighteenth century, and a number of highly decorative landscape and garden series were produced in French and Netherlandish workshops during the second third of the eighteenth century. Among the most notable was the series of romantic pastorals that Boucher designed for the Beauvais workshops between 1734 and 1736 (64.165.1–.8). Known as the Fetes Italiennes, and loosely inspired by the idyllic park scenes of Antoine Watteau, this series depicted handsome gentlefolk and peasants in idealized exterior settings.",'animal_fibre'
"The story of Jacob as depicted in this set of six tapestries (1983.73.1–.6) begins with the scene of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob (Gen. 25:29–34). Esau, the hunter, sits with his bow and quiver at his feet. He clasps hands with Jacob, his brother, who is clad in the starred robe that will identify him throughout the story. By this handshake Esau and Jacob seal their agreement, and the former accepts a bowl of food in exchange for his birthright as firstborn. The secondary scenes represent different moments in time and serve to advance the story. In the center distance Esau is shown hunting with two dogs. To the right, Rebecca, mother of Esau and Jacob, is seen cooking outside the tent, probably preparing food for Jacob to present o his father, Isaac (Gen. 27). The narrative continues to unfold in the other tapestries, which depict Rachel giving her servant Bilhah to Jacob (Gen. 30:1–4), Rachel and Bilhah with her son Dan, and Jacob making a covenant with his father-in-law",'animal_fibre'

This tapestry, woven during the reign of Empress Catherine II of Russia, was probably entirely the work of Russian weavers, and is part of a large group of technically proficient tapestries modelled after great paintings in the Russian royal collection.",'animal_fibre'
"Representing spring and summer, fire and air, these hangings (MMA 46.43.1-.4) were part of a larger set that must also have included the two missing seasons and elements. This series included portraits of Louis XIV, his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, marquise de Montespan (1641 – 1707 ), and six of their children, all shown as deities. The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers. The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds. Various birds, insects, and wind instruments are rendered around this medallion, while a sunburst is shown above and Juno with peacock below. The closeness of the depiction of Louis XIV to an image of the king painted on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles by Charles Le Brun in 1683 – 84 makes it likely that the designs for the main figures in the set of hangings were supplied by his workshop; however, they may be the work of the painter François Bonnemer (1638 – 1689 ), who is known to have made cartoons after compositions by Le Brun. In 1685 Bonnemer provided designs for the embroidered seat covers of the benches and stools in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alentours, or decorative borders, full of delightful details, are believed to be by Jean Lemoyen le Lorrain, an artist little known today who worked in the circle of Le Brun.The other embroideries are thought to depict three of Montespan’s children with the king: Louise-Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes (1673 – 1743 ), with flowers symbolizing Flora, or spring (MMA 46.43.1); Françoise-Marie, Mademoiselle de Blois (1677 – 1749 ), with wheat ears, as Ceres, or summer (MMA 46.43.2); and Louis-Auguste, duc de Maine (1670 – 1736 ), in armor, as Mars, or fire (MMA 46.43.3).The compositions of the seasons include floral wreaths with the zodiac symbols for the appropriate months, while salamanders, torches, smoking braziers, and censers pertain to the element fire. The background of these rare surviving embroideries is worked in metal thread, now tarnished, which must have given them a sumptuous and shimmering appearance when they were first made. The hangings were documented in 1718 as in the collection of Louis-Alexandre, comte de Toulouse (1678 – 1737 ), the youngest child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, at the Château de Rambouillet. During the nineteenth century they belonged to King Louis-Philippe and were hung at the Palais Royal, Paris.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, adapted from The Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts/Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide and Jeffrey Munger; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010]",'animal_fibre'
"This pair of embroidered curtains with chinoiserie designs would have decorated the sides of a European state bed of the late seventeenth to early eighteenth century. Originally, these curtains may have been part of a larger suite of furnishings for the decoration of an entire bedroom–a canape (settee) now in the private rooms of Madame de Maintenon at Fontainebleau has very similar embroidered designs.¹ The complete set of bed hangings probably included matching upper valances for the tester, lower valances for the frame supporting the mattresses, and a coordinating bedcover and headcloth, like the set of French bedroom furnishings now in the Metropolitan Museum (see MMA 53.2.1a-d, .2a-d). Oversize fanciful flora, a design element familiar from the so-called bizarre silks, are joined in these curtains by human figures dressed in vaguely Chinese garments, imaginary Asian winged dragons, and pairs of long-tailed birds. Early chinoiseriestyle furnishings, made in sturdy tent and cross stitches on canvas, were used over a wide geographic area in northern Europe during the first half of the eighteenth century, and a good number have survived.² The Metropolitan’s side curtains, with their yellow background, are most likely French, as extant examples of the yellow or pale backgrounds are associated with production or use in France. To date, no documentation regarding the commission or production for these various suites of furnishings has been discovered, though we know that another such group was probably ordered from Paris in 1721 for Favorite Palace in Ludwigsburg, Germany, the summer residence of Sybilla Augusta, margravine of Baden-Baden (1675–1733).³ Most of these embroideries, however, were worked on a dark background, either blue or black, and are therefore more closely connected with the aesthetic of English tapestries from the likes of John Vanderbank, with their reference to the dark backgrounds of Asian lacquer screens (see MMA 53.165.2). No design drawings or sources have been identified for these embroideries, which, like the Vanderbank tapestries, are decorative pastiches probably taking inspiration from the same variety of sources employed by contemporary tapestry designers, including imported fabrics and their European counterparts, the bizarre silks.⁴ A feature of Chinese art that confounded and intrigued European observers is very much present in these embroideries. Writers from the late seventeenth and well into the eighteenth century remarked on the asymmetry that was prevalent in Chinese design and architecture, as opposed to the preference for symmetry and pleasing proportion in Western taste.⁵ These early chinoiserie embroideries embody the attempt to capture the beautiful disorder"" that Europeans found so irresistible.

"In a gently wooded landscape, mythological figures gather. Together with the contiguous scene in the tapestry the Festival of Psyche with Bacchus (53.225.9), the composition broadens to include a glorious credenza display of gilded plate with precious textiles, in a scene traditionally identified as depicting preparations for the wedding feast of Cupid and Psyche.This tapestry is from a set of eight, traditionally called Les Sujets de la Fable. The designs for all eight tapestries are based in part upon drawings then in Louis XIV's collection- now preserved in the Louvre- which were all, at that time, attributed to Giulio Romano. Four of the tapestries in this series- all of which are part of The Met’s collection- ultimately take as their inspiration frescos by Giulio Romano and his assistants in the Palazzo Te, Mantua.

"This piece is part of a set of twelve armchairs and two settees ordered in Paris in 1753 by Baron Johann Ernst Bernstorff, Danish ambassador to the court of Versailles between 1744 and 1751. After returning to Denmark, Bernstorff commissioned this seat furniture for the tapestry room of his new residence in Copenhagen that was hung with four wall tapestries of the Amours des Dieux series woven at the Beauvais Manufactory.

"While the intended use of some Indian chintzes is difficult to determine, there can be no doubt that this panel was made to cover a European-style chair seat, although it was never used. The design’s overall shape indicates that it was created specifically for an English chair dating between about 1720 and 1740.¹In comparison with the number of extant furniture frames from the eighteenth century, relatively few pieces of intact upholstery from that period have survived. We know that contemporary upholstery fabric—whether woven silk or wool, embroidery, or painted and dyed cotton, like the present example—was often ordered before the frame itself, which was then made to accommodate the textile. The fragility of this fine cotton fabric makes this survival all the more remarkable; had it been used, the seat cover would not be in such pristine condition. Parts of two related curtains also exist,² and the three pieces were likely from one matching suite of furnishing chintz. This suite was perhaps made specifically for an English East India Company employee, who could have potentially circumvented the official prohibition on Indian cotton imports into Great Britain in force between 1721 and 1774, although none of the extant pieces has a company mark to confirm this attribution. More naturalistically drawn than in most Indian chintzes, the flowers can readily be identified as varieties common to European gardens of the time—roses, carnations, and hyacinths, among others.³ The seat cover design can be compared with European embroidered upholstery of the period, particularly English pieces made of wool and silk tent stitch on canvas; some of these embroideries also depict exotic-looking goods along with the flowers, such as a blue-and-white ceramic vase that contains the bouquet on an English chair upholstery dated 1739 (MMA no. 1974.28.204a,b).  The composition of this painted-and-dyed cotton chair seat is, in fact, a domesticated variation of the Tree of Life palampore—with the tree minimized. A room furnished with a suite of this Indian chintz design would have had a look very different from that of a room furnished with grand Tree of Life hangings: the exotic forest has been transformed into a garden of familiar flowers, with borders that contain fantasy flora and leaves similar to those found on other Indian cottons. We have further proof here of the Indian cotton painters’ ability to adapt their considerable talents to specific tastes.

"The Chinese produced both painted wallpaper and painted silk wall hangings for export during the eighteenth century, and the workshops that made these wall coverings may have used the same patterns for both techniques. Silk wall coverings accounted for a very small percentage of the textiles exported from China to the West.¹ Along with the painted papers, however, their influence on the perception of chinoiserie in Europe is probably disproportionate to the actual number produced, as these wall coverings became closely associated with the invention of the ""Chinese room,"" an essential feature of European country houses and retreats.²Painted pictorial wall decorations were entirely new products developed specifically for the European export market. Nothing like them were used in domestic Chinese interior decoration. The antecedent may have been the Chinese practice, noted by early travelers, of using monochrome paper coverings on their interior walls to create the effect of a uniformly white wall, without other decoration.³ Painted silk may have been used as a substitute for paper in the eighteenth century, as suppliers had a difficult time manufacturing enough paper to meet the requirements of European clients. In 1759 one such customer, Emily Lennox (1731–1814), great-granddaughter of Charles II of England and wife of James Fitzgerald, Earl of Kildare (1722û1773), commissioned her husband to buy her 150 yards of painted taffeta for bedroom furnishings while he was in London. Although the acquisition of this amount in a single pattern was said to be impossible, he finally succeeded, and according to Emily the painted ""Indian"" silk was only slightly more expensive than a silk damask available in Dublin, and infinitely more attractive.⁴Paper hangings depicting garden scenes with flowering trees that grow from large Chinese vessels resting on decorative stands are preserved in several German and English collections.⁵ This painted silk also appears to be influenced by Indian chintz palampores, with their delicate meandering branches bearing a variety of fruits and flowers and populated by assorted small birds and insects. Here the regular meander and the delicacy of the design are closer to the dress silks of the later eighteenth century than to the more regimented garden scenes of the wallpapers. It is a charming hybrid of the Chinese and Indian motifs that continued to be popular into the late eighteenth century.

"This tapestry was part of a set of twelve celebrating courtly pastimes, each dedicated to a month of the year. Here, courtiers enjoy the mild mid-spring weather of April; they venture out of the castle to go boating, gather flowers, and make music with a recorder, a lute and a dulcimer. In contrast with these leisurely dalliances, a shepherd leading his flock to the fields and a maid milking toward the left hint at busy agricultural life reawakening after atrophied winter. October, from the same series, is on display nearby.Though woven in eighteenth-century Paris, these hangings were designed after a sixteenth-century Netherlandish tapestry set (now lost) in the French royal collection.

This panel was probably one of two panels on a cope.

"The Mobilier National, successor to Colbert's royal Garde-Meuble de la Couronne, has been responsible for the decoration of state residences in France to the present day. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Garde-Meuble oversaw the ordering of textiles from Lyon as part of a general plan to support French industry and decrease competitive textile imports from Italy and elsewhere. Lyon silk manufacturers, known collectively as the Grande Fabrique, were sustained by these commissions and, in response to strict regulatory edicts, brought an unsurpassed degree of beauty and quality to the fabrics they produced. After 1792, all work for the Garde-Meuble ceased in Lyon until January 1802, when Napoleon and Josephine toured the factories on the Quai Saint-Clair. Commissions were soon underway to decorate the palaces being refurbished by the Garde-Meuble, which Napoleon reorganized and designated the Mobilier Impérial.Designed by Jean-Pierre Séguin for the fourth petit salon of the apartment of Napoleon I at Versailles, this fabric was not used until the period of the Restoration by the duchesse d'Angoulême at Saint-Cloud. A gros de Tours (heavy silk), its design is based upon a wall fabric at Malmaison. Its bright yellow ground is punctuated by cerise rosettes and bunches of brocaded lilacs and anemones within central medallions. The lilac and anemone patterns covered chair backs and seats respectively.",'animal_fibre'
"By the late seventeenth century, the appeal of Far Eastern goods and motifs had reached most levels of English society. Those who could not afford a cabinet mounted with imported Asian lacquer panels or a suite of tapestries like those produced by John Vanderbank (see MMA 53.165.2) could still satisfy their taste by wearing a petticoat or other fashionable accessory decorated with exotic motifs. In 1688 John Stalker and George Parker published A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing, which includes twenty-four copperplate designs that could be used to decorate a variety of objects (see MMA 32.80.2). This book also gives detailed instructions on how to create imitation lacquer, or japanning, on various household objects. The text shows a lack of specificity regarding culture and geography that was typical of the period. For example, in their preface, the authors sing the praises of Japan and its architecture, but in the instructions the reader is advised ""that if you would exactly imitate and copie [sic] out the Japan [design for imitation lacquer]"" one should look to ""the true Indian work"" where they ""never crowd up their ground with many Figures, Houses, or Trees, but allow great space to little work.""¹There are extant English mirrors that retain their original ""Japanned"" frames, as well as American furniture decorated with motifs from works like A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing.² However, such books inspired more than just imitation lacquer on furniture. This embroidered panel and its mate are among a number of English examples from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that are stitched with similar exotic designs. A small quilt in the Metropolitan Museum and two panels in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, are all embroidered with the motifs of the woman carrying a fan with an attendant who shades her with a parasol, and tiny pavilions dwarfed by oversize foliage.³  One of the panels in Boston bears the rare signature of a professional pattern draftsman, one John Stilwell who had a shop near Covent Garden, London. Stilwell would have drawn his designs directly on fabric that was then embroidered; for inspiration he probably relied on publications such as A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing.

"Spot samplers feature motifs that are scattered in a seemingly random fashion over the surface of the foundation fabric, usually linen.

These ribbons consisted of black embroidery on white linen. The women of Marken are said to have kept their samplers in or near their kitchens for handy reference, so much of the needlework appears darkened from residue from cooking fires.

"This elaborate beadwork basket is one of a group of similar surviving examples that have been compared to silver baskets of similar form that were traditionally used to hold a child’s clothes during the christening ceremony. Although such beadwork baskets clearly did not lend themselves to this kind of practical use, their imagery is also usually celebratory and commemorative of marriage or betrothal. Such is the case with this piece, which celebrates the union in 1662 of King Charles II and Catherine of Braganza. They stand in the center of the satin panel, surrounded by a profusion of fruits and flowers that is generally suggestive of fecundity, although such elements as the butterflies, a radiant sun, and an oak sapling may have been chosen for their specifically Royalist associations. In this context, the peacock at the center beneath the royal couple may be an emblem of the Restoration, as the peacock’s traditionally incorruptible body was associated with rebirth and resurrection. The four female figures who stand around the royal couple are the Four Continents, identifiable by the creatures that accompany them. Europe with a stag stands at top left, Asia with a leopard at top right. The lower register is less clear because of the interchangeability of the figures’ attributes, but nonetheless the griffin probably represents Africa and the cockatrice America (see also MMA, 39.13.2a). The placement of the royal couple at the center of the Four Continents was to situate their union within the wider compass of a divinely appointed natural order.A number of very similar beadwork baskets survive from the third quarter of the seventeenth century and share the same essential structure: a rectangular frame made from heavy gauge wire, spherical feet, and everted sides extending outward from the base, with regular intervals of wire of the same gauge forming square openings. The handles are bent in a trefoil shape and extend from the center of each of the four sides. The wire is wrapped in variegated colored patterns of beads.It has been suggested that the introduction of beadwork into English embroidery was related to a growing trade with the Far East, Africa, and the Americas. Glass beads, or ""bugles,"" were produced on a large scale in Venice and Amsterdam in the seventeenth century and shipped in quantity to ports near London, where they were destined to be traded for fine materials that were imported to Europe. Joan Edwards speculated that the use of these beads in embroidery must have developed suddenly after the 1630s when this trade first began. She posited that haberdashers, merchants, or bead traders, who often also sold wire, realized the market potential of the use of such beads in women’s embroidery. Many raised-work pictures of the period also incorporate glass beads, demonstrating an appetite for the unusual and exuberant.It is probable that baskets of this kind were made by professionals or perhaps sold as kits. Certainly, it is likely that the intricate and lifelike fruits were professionally produced. Even the king and queen are produced on a slip of canvas and were probably prefabricated. This is substantiated by a strikingly similar basket, from the Untermyer collection, now at Colonial Williamsburg, which has the same form of frame and whose applied fruits and flowers with an identically posed king and queen are worked in the same beaded pattern and colors.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'

"Anna Maria Garthwaite began designing silks in the mid-1720s, when she was in her thirties. It is not known how she learned the art of designing for silk weaving, but her efficient use of materials and, more importantly her graceful designs show that she thoroughly understood her craft. Her family was acquainted with several naturalists of the period, which may account for the skilled rendering of flowers seen in her work.Many of the designs she produced from the 1720s through 1756 have been preserved in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, including the original design drawing for this silk along with another example of the textile itself. Most of Garthwaite's extant drawings are annotated with the date of the design, in addition to technical notes and sometimes even the name of the weaver to whom the design was sold. The colors of the design on paper are generally those that were woven. But in this case, the weaver changed the color scheme slightly and added a texture to the background.This design is typical of English dress silks of the period: the spare sprays of flowers are set on a white background, and the branch supporting the flowers meanders back and forth across the width of the fabric. The appearance of the truncated branch from which various types of flowers bloom may be a nod to the chinoiserie trend in the eighteenth-century Rococo style.",'animal_fibre'

"The Danish statesman of German origin Baron Johann Hartwig Ernst Bernstorff (1712-1772) remarked about King Frederick V of Denmark (1723-1766) that he ""loved France with a passion.""¹ The same could be said of Bernstorff, who was a true Francophile and was credited with speaking the language better than many French people.² During his tenure as Danish ambassador at the court of Versailles, from 1744 until 1751, Bernstorff developed a marked preference for the arts of France and lived in a beautifully furnished hôtel in the rue Bourbon in Paris.³ In 1752, not long after he was recalled to Copenhagen to assume the post of minister of foreign affairs, Bernstorff began building a grand town house in a new part of the city named Frederiksstaden, after the king. Although the exterior of the house, designed by Johann Gottfried Rosenberg (ca. 1709-1776), betrays German influence, the interior decoration was according to the latest French taste.  Particularly beautiful was the tapestry room on the main floor, embellished with four hangings from the series Les Amours des Dieux (The Loves of the Gods). Woven of wool and silk at the Beauvais Manufactory in 1754, after designs by the painter François Boucher (1703-1770), these tapestries were commissioned for Bernstorff by his friend the collector Louis-Antoine Crozat, Baron de Thiers (1700-1770), who acted as his representative in France.⁴ To complement these tapestries, a set of twelve chair backs, seats, and matching armrests as well as the covers for two settees were woven at the same time.⁵ The set of wall hangings and the tapestry-covered seat furniture -- two settees and twelve armchairs -- were shipped to Copenhagen and installed in 1756. A marble fireplace and overmantel mirror as well as three pier glasses and three console tables were also made in France for this room, as were the gilt-bronze three-light candelabra signed by François-Thomas Germain (1726-1791) and based on designs by Pierre Contant d'Ivry (1698-1777).⁶ The splendid carved and gilded armchairs and settees that were arranged against the walls of the room must have formed an important element of the decoration, which was described by Baron de Thiers as ""satisfying our ultimate conception of exquisite luxury.""⁷  The frames of the seat furniture were made by the Parisian joiner Nicolas-Quinibert Foliot, who stamped eight of the chairs and one of the settees. Established in the rue de Cléry, just like his father, Nicolas Foliot (ca. 1675-1740), whom he succeeded as menuisier du Garde-Meuble du Roi, the younger Foliot supplied many pieces to the court. Characteristic of his furniture is the somewhat massive, undulating outline of the chairs in this set, enlivened by symmetrically placed Rococo ornament such as the floral garlands, palm branches, and stylized leaves, which are gadrooned. A prominent shell motif forms the center of the back rail on both the chairs and the settees. Supported on cabriole legs, the feet are elegantly adorned with a large flower head. The set is upholstered à châssis, with removable tapestry seats, armrests, and backs, displaying colorful compositions of birds and animals in landscapes after designs by the painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686-1755), codirector of the Beauvais Manufactory from 1734 until his death.⁸ Yellow and brown symmetrical borders of scrolling foliage and rocaille motifs surround these scenes that clearly reflect the outline of the seat furniture, creating a beautiful harmony between the woven covers and the carved and gilded wooden frames.  The tapestry room remained intact until the beginning of the twentieth century, despite the vicissitudes of Bernstorff's house after his death. He bequeathed it to his nephew Andreas Peter Bernstorff (1735-1797), who, like his uncle, served as foreign minister of Denmark.⁹ The property was sold by his son to developers. It was divided and later reunited, and in 1829 became the residence of Prince Frederick Ferdinand (1792-1863) and his bride, Princess Caroline (1793-1881), the eldest daughter of the Danish King Frederick VI. There were renovations to the palace, but the tapestry room was left unaltered and the seat furniture was listed as in situ in the inventory drawn up during that same year.¹⁰ The widowed Princess Caroline remained in the house until the end of her life. The next owner of the Bernstorff palace was King George I of the Hellenes (1845-1913), the second son of King Christian IX of Denmark (1818-1906), who stayed there during visits to his country of birth. It was during this time that the crowned-G mark was branded into the wood of the furniture seats, identifying the pieces as his property. George I sold the seat furniture and the tapestries separately, early in the twentieth century. By 1902 the American financier and collector J. Pierpont Morgan (1837-1913) had acquired the Foliot chairs and settees from the London dealer Charles Wertheimer.¹¹ Morgan kept the set with most of the rest of his collection at his London town house to avoid paying United States import duties on artworks more than one hundred years old. Much to their surprise, Queen Alexandra of England (1844-1925) and her sister Dowager Empress Marie of Russia (1847-1928), both Danish princesses, recognized the seat furniture during a visit in 1908 as having belonged to their brother George I.¹² After the tariff was lifted, the suite was shipped to New York as a loan to the exhibition of Morgan's collection held at the Museum in 1912. Morgan died the next year, and, in 1915, following the exhibition, the furniture was returned to his heirs, who sold the settees and chairs to the New York art dealership Duveen Brothers. Presumably hoping to make a double profit, Joseph Duveen (1869-1939) had the tapestry covers removed from their eighteenth-century frames and fitted on Louis XV-style chairs and settees that were specifically made for this purpose by Carlhian et Cie, the Parisian decorating firm of Paul Carlhian and his brother André.¹³In 1919, assuming he was acquiring antique furniture, one of Duveen's regular clients, the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. (1874-1960) agreed to purchase, for the staggering sum of 650,000 dollars, what was in fact a set of twelve reproduction chairs and two reproduction settees with the Beauvais covers from the Bernstorff tapestry room.¹⁴The seat furniture was included in this condition in the Metropolitan Museum's fiftieth-anniversary exhibition the next year.  The original pieces of furniture received modern upholstery, and half of the set was sold; the other half remained with the dealer. Only in 1948 was it discovered that the frames of the seat furniture in the Rockefeller collection were new, and a thoroughgoing effort was made to locate the eighteenth-century frames. In 1951 six of the original chairs and one settee were found in the Duveen Brothers warehouse, and the remaining half of the set turned up in 1965 at the Gothic Revival-style manor house Lyndhurst, in Tarrytown, New York. The last owner of this house had been Anna, duchess of Talleyrand-Périgord (1875-1961), the youngest daughter of the railroad magnate Jay Gould (1836-1892), who was an avid collector of French furniture.¹⁵ Having subsequently been acquired for the Rockefellers, the entire suite of seat furniture and tapestry covers eventually came into the possession of the Museum.¹⁶ Clothed once again in their original upholstery, the armchairs and settees serve as excellent reminders of the fact that French furniture was widely admired during the eighteenth century and served as elegant furnishings for residences all over Europe.

"""Italian"" is one of the rare textiles by Owen Jones. Fewer than thirty of his textile designs are known to exist, and they all date to the early 1870s. This silk textile typifies Jones' predilection for formal, repeating patterns, in contrast to the naturalistic, three-dimensional floral designs found on many Victorian furnishing fabrics. Jones, who was trained as an architect, is probably best known as the author of The Grammar of Ornament, first published in 1856. The book provided thirty-seven principles of design and an ambitious survey of decorative motifs from cultures around the world. It was intended to serve as inspiration and guide for designers in all facets of the decorative arts, and was influential throughout the second half of the nineteenth century.",'animal_fibre'
"This tapestry is one of eight that reproduce, in part, a set of twenty ordered in 1520 by Pope Leo X for the Hall of the Consistory in the Vatican.  The design was conceived as an allegorical celebration of the golden age under the Medicis and under Leo X in particular. The theme and format of the set may have been conceived by Raphael (both of the putti in this tapestry derive from lost paintings by him), but the designs were executed by his pupils.  Several of the preparatory sketches are in the hand of Giovanni de Udine, while the cartoons were painted in Brussels by Tommaso Vincidor, who traveled there for that purpose in 1520.The ground of the original set was woven in gold thread, which may account for its disappearance during the late eighteenth century, a period in which many historic tapestries were burned in order to extract the precious metals they contained.  The seventeenth-century reweavings imitate the golden effect with striations of yellow silk and wool.",'animal_fibre'

"The textile used in this chasuble is a beautiful example of elaborate weaving. Here the use of cut and uncut velvet is used to delineate the interior layers of the flowers, which gives them a rich and dimensional appearance. The use of metallic bouclé to provide an additional level of patterning also shows a high level of weaving acumen. The curvilinear pattern known as ferronerie is used here on the main fabric of the chasuble. Ferronerie was prevalent in textile design during the Renaissance and reflected the ornate ironwork of the period.",'animal_fibre'

"Imported Middle Eastern textiles were highly valued luxury goods during this period, and this velvet pattern was originally the product of the Persian workshops of Tabriz.

"This furnishing textile epitomizes Rococo Revival textiles, with flowers enclosed in asymmetrical cartouches comprised of """""" and ""S"" scrolls. Mid-eighteenth-century Rococo textiles did not make use of the cartouche in this way; this motif has been lifted from other eighteenth-century art forms such as furniture, carved wall panels (boiserie), and silver. Revival styles were particularly popular in the United States, and French textiles were frequently imported for use in upper-class American homes of the mid-nineteenth century. The carpet in the Museum's Rococo Revival Parlor displays a similar combination of asymmetrical scrolls and floral bouquets.",'animal_fibre'
"The bound Christ, humiliated and all but naked, mockingly draped in an imperial purple cloak and thorny crown, is presented to the jeering crowd, as described in the Bible (John, 19:5), the inscription woven in gilded silver, “ECCE HOMO” declaring ‘here is the man’. In a device popularized by Albrecht Dürer, the crowd is not actually represented; instead, it is as if his tormenters present Christ directly to us, the tapestry’s viewers, making us complicit in his degradation and rendering this hanging ideal as a tool for devotional contemplation and meditation.This small hanging combines tapestry conventions, like the decorative border filled with beautifully observed fruit, flora and foliage, with compositional devices more typical of contemporary panel paintings, like the half-length devotional format, and the foreground ledge and slightly awkward, encroaching architectural setting. This tapestry’s design reuses a prototype almost certainly created in the workshop of the successful Antwerp-based artist, Quentin Metsys, and disseminated in numerous paintings; a painted version attributed to Metsys, particularly closely related to this tapestry’s design, is in the Doge’s Palace, Venice. Like The Met’s tapestry 32.100.389, this is one of a sizeable group of smaller-scale devotional tapestries produced by talented weavers almost certainly working in Brussels- the center of excellence of figurative tapestry weaving throughout the late fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries- and probably made on speculation for sale on the open market.",'animal_fibre'
"This work belongs to a series of tapestries designed to cover the walls of an entire room.  Such sets were often referred to in medieval inventories as ""rooms"" (""chambres"").  It is possible that this set was made for the French king Charles VII, whose colors were white, red, and green and one of whose emblems was the rose tree.  A royal connection is certainly likely, for the tapestries are sumptuous, with metal threads not only in the clothing and jewelry worn by the fashionable courtiers and ladies, but also in the background leaves, buds, and open roses.  Working from full-scale painted designs, the weavers produced tapestries like this by forcing the cross threads (weft) tightly into place—each different-colored thread separately—until all the undyed lengthwise threads (warp) were concealed.  Even with several weavers working side by side—the usual procedure—and with the tapestries of a single set being worked simultaneously on separate looms, their production would have taken several years.  Hung on the walls of a castle or manor house, tapestries not only served the practical function of insulation, preventing dampness from entering the room, but also constituted a visible and portable declaration of their owner's wealth and taste.",'animal_fibre'

"A fine example of English amateur embroidery of the late 1600s, this work bag bears the initials of the young needleworker who made it, who also added the date 1669, and her age, ten. The bag, which would have been used to store embroidery implements and supplies, is decorated on both front and back with red wool thread, primarily in a double running stitch, on a linen foundation.Embroidery was an essential component of female education in England in the seventeenth century; students generally completed at least one sampler displaying a variety of techniques and designs. By the mid-seventeenth century the repeating border designs worked on samplers had become anachronistic in the contemporary design vocabulary, having been derived from sixteenth-century pattern books produced on the Continent and adapted by English publishers. To find an old-fashioned border design on a practical object like this work bag is unusual. Yet the detached motifs in the carefully organized yet lively design - human figures; native plants and flowers, including strawberries, acorns and honeysuckle; heraldic animals such as lions, leopards, and stags; and more prosaic creatures such as birds and caterpillars - are typical of those found on English embroidered textiles throughout this era.",'animal_fibre'
"This armorial tapestry celebrates the Greder family of Solothurn (Switzerland), many of whom served in the French army. It was probably commissioned by François Laurent Greder (1658–1716) between 1691, when he became a brigadier and 1694, when he was made a knight of the Order of Saint Louis. The dramatic use of the swans to flank the armorial is an allusion to the swan feet that form part of the Greder arms. The tapestry was woven in two pieces which were subsequently sewn together (the seam is visible along the center vertical), probably because the workshop’s loom widths precluded the large dimensions required for the tapestry. The tapestry was likely woven in one of the smaller, less-organized commercial weaving workshops in Paris, such as that of Louis and Jean Baptiste Hinard, or of Gilles Bacor, or in the Lorraine region of France.",'animal_fibre'

"Images of gardens were popular in the tapestry medium from the medieval era, where the so-called mille-fleurs (thousand flowers) (see also 2013.506) provided a decorative, and sometimes symbolic, setting for scenes of romance and play. Park and garden tapestries continued to enjoy popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly for the decoration of more intimate chambers, where they provided a pleasant contrast with the grander subject matter of tapestries used in more formal settings. The theme enjoyed new popularity with the advent of the Rococo style during the eighteenth century, and a number of highly decorative landscape and garden series were produced in French and Netherlandish workshops during the second third of the eighteenth century. Among the most notable was the series of romantic pastorals that Boucher designed for the Beauvais workshops between 1734 and 1736 (64.165.1–.8). Known as the Fetes Italiennes, and loosely inspired by the idyllic park scenes of Antoine Watteau, this series depicted handsome gentlefolk and peasants in idealized exterior settings.",'animal_fibre'

"In Le dessinateur, pour les fabriques d’etoffes d’or, d’argent et de soie, a manual for the silk designer published in 1765, one of the textile terms included is persienne. It is described as a weave structure with characteristics that correspond to those of many so-called lace-pattern silks of the 1720s. The principal feature of this fabric was, according to the author, Antoine Nicolas Joubert de l’Hiberderie, the juxtaposition of two contrasting foundation weaves—a dark or boldly colored satin weave and a white plain weave—that were augmented by brocading in additional colors of silk and possibly one or more metallic threads.¹  It is unclear in Le dessinateur whether persienne was a purely technical term or whether it also described a style. In addition to the technical definition given in the 1765 publication, evidence that persienne referred to a style as well as a structure is provided by labels inscribed on the drawings of such designs dating between 1723 and 1730.²  The serrated leaves and rather stiff drawing of the flowers on the present silk piece reflect both Ottoman and Indo-Persian floral designs. In its weave, the silk adheres to the technical definition of a persienne, while suggesting a debt to the art and architecture of the Islamic world in its use of the mihrab-shaped compartments that frame the central plant motif. So, while this distinctive type of silk, made in the weaving centers of France, England, and the Netherlands, is now referred to as ""lace patterned"" owing to its lacy ribbonlike motifs, the eighteenth-century term might serve just as well. This type of vibrantly colored floral silk was used in both men’s and women’s fashions, including a number of men's banyans. That this textile was a product of European looms did not diminish the exotic properties that made it appropriate for leisure wear, just as the so-called bizarre silks were in earlier decades (see MMA 64.35.1). These European silks also spawned Indian chintz designs that were created both for the European market, like a chintz panel in the Museum's collection (see MMA 36.90.121), and for sale closer to the Indian subcontinent, such as a long cloth made for the Indonesian market in the Museum's collection (see MMA 2011.44). The subdued monochrome palette of the chintz panel may have meant that it was intended for mourning wear, the colors of which gradually shifted from black to increasingly lighter shades of blue and the eventual addition of red during the period of observance.³ European fashions in silk design changed rapidly, so it is probably safe to assume that any chintzes made to imitate popular Western patterns were produced fairly quickly so as not to be outdated before they arrived in Europe. However, these patterns might have had a longer life span in markets in the East.

It is attributed to weavers working in Rome at the San Michele manufactory, which had been founded in 1710 by Pope Clement XI to complement the wool and dyeing workshops at the orphanage of San Michele a Ripa. The tapestry is part of a large group of technically proficient tapestries, many made as diplomatic gifts, modelled after paintings in the Vatican collection.

"As its full-size domed canopy is suspended from the ceiling rather than supported on posts, this tester bed, which bears the stamp of the menuisier Georges Jacob, is a type called lit à la duchesse en impériale. Its original but now fragile hangings, woven in 1782–83 at the Beauvais tapestry manufactory after designs by Jean-Baptiste Huet (1745–1811), have been replaced by modern silk damask, except for the lining of the interior dome. French eighteenth-century beds tended to be lofty, as it was customary to pile them with three or more mattresses filled with straw, wool, horsehair, or feathers. Tobias Smollett (1721–1771) noted in 1766, “French beds are so high, that sometimes one is obliged to mount them by the help of steps.”[1]The custom of receiving visitors while reposing in a large and elegantly fitted out bed was practiced in France during the eighteenth century mostly by aristocratic women. The Museum’s imposing piece of furniture with its exquisitely carved floral decoration, the work of an unknown carver, must have formed a splendid backdrop for such official calls or congratulatory visits. In 1791 the bed is documented as standing in the large bedchamber of Guyonne-Marguerite de Durfort de Lorge, duchesse de Choiseul-Praslin (1737–1806), at her Parisian home, the Hôtel de Belle Isle. Following the turmoil of the Revolution and the political changes of the early nineteenth century, the bed was sold in Paris in 1830. It became part of the famous collections at Hamilton Palace, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the residence of Alexander Hamilton Douglas, tenth Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852), where it was placed in one of the state rooms. The duke’s grandson sold the contents of the palace, including the bed, at a highly anticipated auction that took place in 1882. Through the intermediation of several dealers, the bed was acquired in 1897 by the financier and railroad executive George J. Gould (1864–1923). His wife, the former actress Edith M. Kingdon (1864–1921), used it in her bedroom of their New York town house.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010]Footnotes:[1] Tobias George Smollett. Travels through France and Italy. London, 1766.

After returning to Denmark, Bernstorff commissioned this seat furniture for the tapestry room of his new residence in Copenhagen that was hung with four wall tapestries of the Amours des Dieux series woven at the Beauvais Manufactory. This chair illustrates how French furniture and furnishings were imported all over Europe for the enrichment of palaces and mansions far from Paris. The tapestry covers are woven with animal and bird subjects after designs by the painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686–1755).",'animal_fibre'
"The Danish statesman of German origin Baron Johann Hartwig Ernst Bernstorff (1712-1772) remarked about King Frederick V of Denmark (1723-1766) that he ""loved France with a passion.""¹ The same could be said of Bernstorff, who was a true Francophile and was credited with speaking the language better than many French people.² During his tenure as Danish ambassador at the court of Versailles, from 1744 until 1751, Bernstorff developed a marked preference for the arts of France and lived in a beautifully furnished hôtel in the rue Bourbon in Paris.³ In 1752, not long after he was recalled to Copenhagen to assume the post of minister of foreign affairs, Bernstorff began building a grand town house in a new part of the city named Frederiksstaden, after the king. Although the exterior of the house, designed by Johann Gottfried Rosenberg (ca. 1709-1776), betrays German influence, the interior decoration was according to the latest French taste.  Particularly beautiful was the tapestry room on the main floor, embellished with four hangings from the series Les Amours des Dieux (The Loves of the Gods). Woven of wool and silk at the Beauvais Manufactory in 1754, after designs by the painter François Boucher (1703-1770), these tapestries were commissioned for Bernstorff by his friend the collector Louis-Antoine Crozat, Baron de Thiers (1700-1770), who acted as his representative in France.⁴ To complement these tapestries, a set of twelve chair backs, seats, and matching armrests as well as the covers for two settees were woven at the same time.⁵ The set of wall hangings and the tapestry-covered seat furniture -- two settees and twelve armchairs -- were shipped to Copenhagen and installed in 1756. A marble fireplace and overmantel mirror as well as three pier glasses and three console tables were also made in France for this room, as were the gilt-bronze three-light candelabra signed by François-Thomas Germain (1726-1791) and based on designs by Pierre Contant d'Ivry (1698-1777).⁶ The splendid carved and gilded armchairs and settees that were arranged against the walls of the room must have formed an important element of the decoration, which was described by Baron de Thiers as ""satisfying our ultimate conception of exquisite luxury.""⁷  The frames of the seat furniture were made by the Parisian joiner Nicolas-Quinibert Foliot, who stamped eight of the chairs and one of the settees. Established in the rue de Cléry, just like his father, Nicolas Foliot (ca. 1675-1740), whom he succeeded as menuisier du Garde-Meuble du Roi, the younger Foliot supplied many pieces to the court. Characteristic of his furniture is the somewhat massive, undulating outline of the chairs in this set, enlivened by symmetrically placed Rococo ornament such as the floral garlands, palm branches, and stylized leaves, which are gadrooned. A prominent shell motif forms the center of the back rail on both the chairs and the settees. Supported on cabriole legs, the feet are elegantly adorned with a large flower head. The set is upholstered à châssis, with removable tapestry seats, armrests, and backs, displaying colorful compositions of birds and animals in landscapes after designs by the painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686-1755), codirector of the Beauvais Manufactory from 1734 until his death.⁸ Yellow and brown symmetrical borders of scrolling foliage and rocaille motifs surround these scenes that clearly reflect the outline of the seat furniture, creating a beautiful harmony between the woven covers and the carved and gilded wooden frames.  The tapestry room remained intact until the beginning of the twentieth century, despite the vicissitudes of Bernstorff's house after his death. He bequeathed it to his nephew Andreas Peter Bernstorff (1735-1797), who, like his uncle, served as foreign minister of Denmark.⁹ The property was sold by his son to developers. It was divided and later reunited, and in 1829 became the residence of Prince Frederick Ferdinand (1792-1863) and his bride, Princess Caroline (1793-1881), the eldest daughter of the Danish King Frederick VI. There were renovations to the palace, but the tapestry room was left unaltered and the seat furniture was listed as in situ in the inventory drawn up during that same year.¹⁰ The widowed Princess Caroline remained in the house until the end of her life. The next owner of the Bernstorff palace was King George I of the Hellenes (1845-1913), the second son of King Christian IX of Denmark (1818-1906), who stayed there during visits to his country of birth. It was during this time that the crowned-G mark was branded into the wood of the furniture seats, identifying the pieces as his property. George I sold the seat furniture and the tapestries separately, early in the twentieth century. By 1902 the American financier and collector J. Pierpont Morgan (1837-1913) had acquired the Foliot chairs and settees from the London dealer Charles Wertheimer.¹¹ Morgan kept the set with most of the rest of his collection at his London town house to avoid paying United States import duties on artworks more than one hundred years old. Much to their surprise, Queen Alexandra of England (1844-1925) and her sister Dowager Empress Marie of Russia (1847-1928), both Danish princesses, recognized the seat furniture during a visit in 1908 as having belonged to their brother George I.¹² After the tariff was lifted, the suite was shipped to New York as a loan to the exhibition of Morgan's collection held at the Museum in 1912. Morgan died the next year, and, in 1915, following the exhibition, the furniture was returned to his heirs, who sold the settees and chairs to the New York art dealership Duveen Brothers. Presumably hoping to make a double profit, Joseph Duveen (1869-1939) had the tapestry covers removed from their eighteenth-century frames and fitted on Louis XV-style chairs and settees that were specifically made for this purpose by Carlhian et Cie, the Parisian decorating firm of Paul Carlhian and his brother André.¹³In 1919, assuming he was acquiring antique furniture, one of Duveen's regular clients, the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. (1874-1960) agreed to purchase, for the staggering sum of 650,000 dollars, what was in fact a set of twelve reproduction chairs and two reproduction settees with the Beauvais covers from the Bernstorff tapestry room.¹⁴The seat furniture was included in this condition in the Metropolitan Museum's fiftieth-anniversary exhibition the next year.  The original pieces of furniture received modern upholstery, and half of the set was sold; the other half remained with the dealer. Only in 1948 was it discovered that the frames of the seat furniture in the Rockefeller collection were new, and a thoroughgoing effort was made to locate the eighteenth-century frames. In 1951 six of the original chairs and one settee were found in the Duveen Brothers warehouse, and the remaining half of the set turned up in 1965 at the Gothic Revival-style manor house Lyndhurst, in Tarrytown, New York. The last owner of this house had been Anna, duchess of Talleyrand-Périgord (1875-1961), the youngest daughter of the railroad magnate Jay Gould (1836-1892), who was an avid collector of French furniture.¹⁵ Having subsequently been acquired for the Rockefellers, the entire suite of seat furniture and tapestry covers eventually came into the possession of the Museum.¹⁶ Clothed once again in their original upholstery, the armchairs and settees serve as excellent reminders of the fact that French furniture was widely admired during the eighteenth century and served as elegant furnishings for residences all over Europe.

"The Tapestry Room from Croome Court, Worcestershire, the seat of the Earls of Coventry, was begun in 1763 and finished in 1771. The sixth Earl of Coventry (1722–1809) commissioned these tapestries for Croome Court from Jacques Neilson's workshop at the Royal Gobelins Manufactory in Paris in August 1763. Portraying scenes from classical myths symbolizing the elements, the medallions are based on designs by François Boucher. The set was delivered and in place by June 1771. The group was the first using this design to be woven with a crimson background and it may have been the first made specifically to extend around four walls of a room without architectural frames.",'animal_fibre'
"The great Renaissance artist, Pieter Coecke van Aelst, conceived this series as a spectacular procession of sinners spread across seven tapestries of monumental scale. Each tapestry is dedicated to a particular vice, or Cardinal Sin, represented in female form riding a carriage, surrounded by a colorful retinue of personalities from classical history, mythology and the Bible, embodying the corruption in question. Here, winged Gluttony, wine-leaves in her hair, seated in her harpy-drawn chariot, is preceded by the gourmands Cleopatra, Alexander the Great and Silenus, whilst young Bacchus leads the way. In the background, the Old Testament heroine, Judith, can be seen dispatching the drunken Holofernes, in a vignette of the virtue of Temperance overcoming its sinful counterpart.Although it is not known who owned this particular tapestry, many editions of Coecke’s Seven Deadly Sins series were woven in Brussels and were acquired by great collectors like Henry VIII, King of England and Mary of Hungary, Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands. Although the palette remains so strikingly intense, recent technical analysis reveals that the dyes, metal-wrapped threads and weaving technique are all synonymous with mid-sixteenth century production. This border was added during a later, probably nineteenth-century, restoration.",'animal_fibre'
"Images of gardens were popular in the tapestry medium from the medieval era, where the so-called mille-fleurs (thousand flowers) (see also 2013.506) provided a decorative, and sometimes symbolic, setting for scenes of romance and play. Park and garden tapestries continued to enjoy popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly for the decoration of more intimate chambers, where they provided a pleasant contrast with the grander subject matter of tapestries used in more formal settings. The theme enjoyed new popularity with the advent of the Rococo style during the eighteenth century, and a number of highly decorative landscape and garden series were produced in French and Netherlandish workshops during the second third of the eighteenth century. Among the most notable was the series of romantic pastorals that Boucher designed for the Beauvais workshops between 1734 and 1736 (64.165.1–.8). Known as the Fetes Italiennes, and loosely inspired by the idyllic park scenes of Antoine Watteau, this series depicted handsome gentlefolk and peasants in idealized exterior settings. In this case, a pretty young woman, a child, and a gardener rest in the shade of an overgrown terrace, beneath statues of Apollo and Hercules.",'animal_fibre'
"In his A New Description of Paris, of 1687, Germain Brice (1652–1727) mentioned work in progress on “a great Footcloath in the manner of Turky-work, . . . in a place built on purpose at the end of the Cours de la Reine, commonly called the Savonnerie, which is to be the full length of the great Gallery of the Louvre, but is not yet finisht.” Brice referred here to a set of ninety-three carpets, of different but related designs, that was being created for the Grande Galerie of the Palais du Louvre in Paris. The Savonnerie manufactory, which received a monopoly from Louis XIII in 1627 to make knotted-pile rugs in the manner of the Levant, experienced its most creative period under Louis XIV, when the workshops were placed under the direction of the king’s First Painter, Charles Le Brun. The project to cover with carpets the entire floor of the long gallery at the Louvre, measuring more than 480 yards in length, was the most ambitious commission the Savonnerie ever received. The work space was expanded and extra-wide looms were created to accommodate this monumental task. Contrary to tradition, the size of the looms was based on the length of the carpets (which in turn was determined by the width of the long gallery ). The individual designs of the series most likely reflected in some degree the decoration of the ceiling and walls of the gallery.Set against a black ground with scrolling acanthus leaves in the corners, the main motifs of the Museum’s splendid carpet, number thirty-eight of the series, are full of references to the monarchy. The sunflower, symbol of the Sun King, is flanked by the French royal arms and by Louis XIV’s crowned monogram of interlaced Ls.A number of the carpets for the Grande Galerie have compartments at either narrow end showing simulated bas-reliefs in grisaille representing different aspects and virtues of good government. Here the personifications of fame, blowing a trumpet, and fortitude, with a lion and a column, are depicted. Although all the carpets of the original commission but one were woven between 1670 and 1689, Louis XIV appears to have lost interest in the interior decoration of the Louvre, and thus in this monumental project, when he focused his attention on Versailles instead, moving his court there in 1682. When Horace Walpole visited the Louvre in August 1771 the palace was in a derelict state. “Saw the great gallery of Le Brun with battles of Alexander, all the ornaments, ceiling, shutters and even locks and bolts designed by Le Brun, but so abominably neglected that it rains in.” Perhaps it was not such a bad thing after all that the series of Savonnerie carpets appears never to have been laid out in the Grande Galerie as originally intended.",'animal_fibre'

"The settees and chairs illustrated here (see 1974.356.114–.121) were made for the Franckenstein Pavilion in the gardens of Seehof Castle near Bamberg, one of the three summer residences in Southern Germany used by Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, prince bishop of Würzberg and Bamberg. A true garden enthusiast, it was under von Seinsheim that the gardens of Seehof were embellished, which must have resembled the still extant Rococo gardens completed by von Seinsheim at Veitshöchheim. His love for gardens and garden imagery also carried over into the interior decoration and furnishings of his castles, as the Seehof furniture demonstrates. A unique example of German Rococo furniture executed in a more flamboyant style than its French prototypes, the ensemble was designed specifically for the Garden Room in the Franckenstein Pavilion. Used as an audience room, it was referred to as the ""Green Trellis Chamber"" in the 1774 Seehof inventory and painted entirely with trompe l'oeil trellis and foliage.

"The shaped aprons on the front and back of this bookstand bear the crowned initials FPO for Ferdinand Philippe, duc d'Orléans (1810—1842), oldest son of King Louis-Philippe. A noted patron of the arts with eclectic taste, the duke commissioned this striking black and white showpiece from the ébéniste Georges-Alphonse Jacob Desmalter, grandson of the celebrated eighteenth-century menuisier (joiner) Georges Jacob, in 1839. Most likely intended to display Les Offices de la Vierge, a lavish book of hours created for Ferdinand Philippe the previous year, the bookstand consists of a base, a bookcase with two openwork doors supported on baluster-shaped legs, and a sloping upper part with a book rest. A detailed mémoire by Desmalter indicates that the velvet-lined interior originally held a pillow for the missal. The top has a ratcheted mechanism that allows the central panel, embellished with marquetry of ivory, mother-of-pearl, and snakewood, to be raised. The historicizing design by Charles-Auguste Questel reflected contemporary interest in the Renaissance style.

"This suite of four tapestries and its coordinating upholstery (MMA 1978.404.4a-c–.18a–c) were commissioned from the Beauvais manufactory in 1786 and woven between 1790 and 1791.¹ As has been noted, ""The attractive and not impossible suggestion that the set was intended to be a gift from King Louis XVI to George Washington was made by the first scholar to publish the work . . . but it is not supported by any contemporary evidence.""² Regardless of whether the suite was intended as a gift to President Washington, the French Revolution intervened, and it is perhaps miraculous that the tapestries were woven at all. By the time they were complete, the French king was in no position to bestow diplomatic gifts on anyone. It is the representation of America as a rather demure-looking young woman that sets this iconographic scheme apart from other groupings of the Four Continents. In the Beauvais tapestry set, America has evolved from the scantily clad, spear-toting, armadillo-riding, cannibalistic warrior princess seen in sixteenth century representations to the woman dependent on the protection of the female personifications of Liberty and Minerva (whose shield carries the fleur-de-lis of France).³ In addition to this representational shift, the Indian princess who had originally stood for the entire Western Hemisphere here represents only the United States. The concept for this view of America defended by France in the guise of Minerva was suggested by none other than Benjamin Franklin, and a medal based on his suggestion was designed by Augustin Dupre and struck in France in 1782.⁴The production of these tapestries is thus a vivid example of the Gallic enthusiasm for the American colonists’ struggle for independence from Great Britain, France’s longtime foe, which existed at the highest levels of society. This was not the first American subject for the designer of the series, Jean-Jacques- Francois Le Barbier (an official peintre du Roi by 1780). In 1782 his illustration of the first Continental Congress appeared as the frontispiece in Essais historiques et politiques sur les Anglo-Américains (Brussels, 1781–82), just one of several publications on the subject of the American cause that appeared in the early 1780s.⁵ Of course, the French expressed their enthusiasm for the American struggle against the British with more than works of art and propaganda. They supported the Continental Army with money, supplies, and soldiers, including the wealthy marquis de Lafayette (1757–1834), whose fervor for the cause was so great that he sailed to America disguised as a woman to escape detection.

"This luxurious, unmatched glove features a complex design embroidered in silver, gilded silver, and colored silks. The wide, tabbed gauntlets—edged with metallic lace and sequins—depict a hatted man, accompanied by a small dog, kneeling and aiming his gun at a deer. Teeming with natural elements, the other tabs present a serpent shimmying up a stalk, crenelated buildings, cattails, and sea-monsters undulating from below. These natural and supernatural symbols were popular embellishments for housewares, costume, and accessories, as can be seen in a portrait of Ellen Maurice (2017.249), where she holds a glove richly embroidered with gold serpents. This arrangement of symbols may suggest protection from something uncertain. The serpent was understood as a sign of wisdom or prudence—and sea monsters could emblemize danger or the unknown. It is, however, difficult to determine the precise meaning of the scene; the embroidery could represent a personal device or a shared memory with a thoughtful gift-giver. -Sarah Bochicchio, 2020",'animal_fibre'
"George William, sixth earl of Coventry, commissioned this set of tapestries (58.75.2–.13) in Paris in 1763 for the tapestry room at his country seat, Croome Court (Worcestershire), which was then being remodeled by Robert Adam.

The harmonious and decorative quality of the ensemble was enhanced by the provision of en suite furniture covers. The set, comprising twelve pieces of wall covering and thirty-three pieces of furniture upholstery, was delivered and in place by January 1771. This particular tapestry shows the element Water or Neptune rescuing Amnymone in the medallion based on a painting by François Boucher.",'animal_fibre'
"The practice of embroidery was central to the textile production of the the Arts and Crafts movement; the fact that creator and maker were more often one in the same made this an appropriate medium for the expression of William Morris’ ideals. His daughter Mary, known as May, proved to be a skilled designer of embroidery and a skilled needleworker, and ran the Morris & Co. embroidery department from 1885 to 1896. While designs for this embroidered bedcover and the related valance have not been located, the attribution to May Morris is based in its similarity to several of her known works from the 1890s. The embroidery stitches employed- darning and running stitches- are technically very simple, but the skill with which they are executed and the harmonious use of color suggest the work of a professional in the workshop of Morris & Co.",'animal_fibre'
"Tapestry-woven upholstery for two settees and twelve armchairs was commissioned at the same time as the wall hangings depicting the Four Continents (1978.404.1–.4).¹ The Four Continents was one of two suites・each including four wall tapestries and coordinating seating furniture・that were ordered from Beauvais in 1786; the subject of the other suite was to be a series illustrating the arts, sciences, agriculture, and commerce. An earlier suite of tapestry furniture covers depicting the continents was produced at the Royal Manufactory of Gobelins in 1748, and the arrangement of the motifs in Le Barbier’s covers is similar: personifications of the continents are set against a landscape on the seat backs, and native animals populate the seat covers.² This subject in tapestry aligns with the contemporary popularity of the Four Continents in eighteenth-century European art: everything from porcelain table decorations and tablewares to dinner napkins and ceiling frescoes incorporated personifications of the continents (see MMA 64.101.1347, 1348). The settee showing America and Europe emphasizes the close relationship between France and the new United States, which France promoted so forcefully in the tapestry depicting America. The figure of France occupies the center of the sofa back, and America is seated off to the left. In this composition, France is ‘introducing the new nation to Europe across Neptune’s domain, the Atlantic; France’s discarded armor lies at her feet, as the war has been won, and Victory crowns her.’³ The armchairs repeat the female personifications of each continent, attended by male figures and some of the fauna typically associated with each. There are three variations on each of the four continents, and, although they are all slightly different, the iconographic program is consistent. It appears that this upholstery was not affixed to furniture frames until sometime after 1852, decades after its production.⁴ Usually, a client commissioned or purchased high-quality tapestry upholstery before furniture frames were made to accommodate the weavings. This type of upholstery was quite popular in the late eighteenth century, and the Beauvais manufactory made many such sets.⁵ However, the combination of matching wall hangings and seating furniture was more unusual, and clearly more expensive. A suite of furnishings would have been reserved for a formal room, such as a salon or drawing room.

"The Danish statesman of German origin Baron Johann Hartwig Ernst Bernstorff (1712-1772) remarked about King Frederick V of Denmark (1723-1766) that he ""loved France with a passion.""¹ The same could be said of Bernstorff, who was a true Francophile and was credited with speaking the language better than many French people.² During his tenure as Danish ambassador at the court of Versailles, from 1744 until 1751, Bernstorff developed a marked preference for the arts of France and lived in a beautifully furnished hôtel in the rue Bourbon in Paris.³ In 1752, not long after he was recalled to Copenhagen to assume the post of minister of foreign affairs, Bernstorff began building a grand town house in a new part of the city named Frederiksstaden, after the king. Although the exterior of the house, designed by Johann Gottfried Rosenberg (ca. 1709-1776), betrays German influence, the interior decoration was according to the latest French taste.  Particularly beautiful was the tapestry room on the main floor, embellished with four hangings from the series Les Amours des Dieux (The Loves of the Gods). Woven of wool and silk at the Beauvais Manufactory in 1754, after designs by the painter François Boucher (1703-1770), these tapestries were commissioned for Bernstorff by his friend the collector Louis-Antoine Crozat, Baron de Thiers (1700-1770), who acted as his representative in France.⁴ To complement these tapestries, a set of twelve chair backs, seats, and matching armrests as well as the covers for two settees were woven at the same time.⁵ The set of wall hangings and the tapestry-covered seat furniture -- two settees and twelve armchairs -- were shipped to Copenhagen and installed in 1756. A marble fireplace and overmantel mirror as well as three pier glasses and three console tables were also made in France for this room, as were the gilt-bronze three-light candelabra signed by François-Thomas Germain (1726-1791) and based on designs by Pierre Contant d'Ivry (1698-1777).⁶ The splendid carved and gilded armchairs and settees that were arranged against the walls of the room must have formed an important element of the decoration, which was described by Baron de Thiers as ""satisfying our ultimate conception of exquisite luxury.""⁷  The frames of the seat furniture were made by the Parisian joiner Nicolas-Quinibert Foliot, who stamped eight of the chairs and one of the settees. Established in the rue de Cléry, just like his father, Nicolas Foliot (ca. 1675-1740), whom he succeeded as menuisier du Garde-Meuble du Roi, the younger Foliot supplied many pieces to the court. Characteristic of his furniture is the somewhat massive, undulating outline of the chairs in this set, enlivened by symmetrically placed Rococo ornament such as the floral garlands, palm branches, and stylized leaves, which are gadrooned. A prominent shell motif forms the center of the back rail on both the chairs and the settees. Supported on cabriole legs, the feet are elegantly adorned with a large flower head. The set is upholstered à châssis, with removable tapestry seats, armrests, and backs, displaying colorful compositions of birds and animals in landscapes after designs by the painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686-1755), codirector of the Beauvais Manufactory from 1734 until his death.⁸ Yellow and brown symmetrical borders of scrolling foliage and rocaille motifs surround these scenes that clearly reflect the outline of the seat furniture, creating a beautiful harmony between the woven covers and the carved and gilded wooden frames.  The tapestry room remained intact until the beginning of the twentieth century, despite the vicissitudes of Bernstorff's house after his death. He bequeathed it to his nephew Andreas Peter Bernstorff (1735-1797), who, like his uncle, served as foreign minister of Denmark.⁹ The property was sold by his son to developers. It was divided and later reunited, and in 1829 became the residence of Prince Frederick Ferdinand (1792-1863) and his bride, Princess Caroline (1793-1881), the eldest daughter of the Danish King Frederick VI. There were renovations to the palace, but the tapestry room was left unaltered and the seat furniture was listed as in situ in the inventory drawn up during that same year.¹⁰ The widowed Princess Caroline remained in the house until the end of her life. The next owner of the Bernstorff palace was King George I of the Hellenes (1845-1913), the second son of King Christian IX of Denmark (1818-1906), who stayed there during visits to his country of birth. It was during this time that the crowned-G mark was branded into the wood of the furniture seats, identifying the pieces as his property. George I sold the seat furniture and the tapestries separately, early in the twentieth century. By 1902 the American financier and collector J. Pierpont Morgan (1837-1913) had acquired the Foliot chairs and settees from the London dealer Charles Wertheimer.¹¹ Morgan kept the set with most of the rest of his collection at his London town house to avoid paying United States import duties on artworks more than one hundred years old. Much to their surprise, Queen Alexandra of England (1844-1925) and her sister Dowager Empress Marie of Russia (1847-1928), both Danish princesses, recognized the seat furniture during a visit in 1908 as having belonged to their brother George I.¹² After the tariff was lifted, the suite was shipped to New York as a loan to the exhibition of Morgan's collection held at the Museum in 1912. Morgan died the next year, and, in 1915, following the exhibition, the furniture was returned to his heirs, who sold the settees and chairs to the New York art dealership Duveen Brothers. Presumably hoping to make a double profit, Joseph Duveen (1869-1939) had the tapestry covers removed from their eighteenth-century frames and fitted on Louis XV-style chairs and settees that were specifically made for this purpose by Carlhian et Cie, the Parisian decorating firm of Paul Carlhian and his brother André.¹³In 1919, assuming he was acquiring antique furniture, one of Duveen's regular clients, the philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. (1874-1960) agreed to purchase, for the staggering sum of 650,000 dollars, what was in fact a set of twelve reproduction chairs and two reproduction settees with the Beauvais covers from the Bernstorff tapestry room.¹⁴The seat furniture was included in this condition in the Metropolitan Museum's fiftieth-anniversary exhibition the next year.  The original pieces of furniture received modern upholstery, and half of the set was sold; the other half remained with the dealer. Only in 1948 was it discovered that the frames of the seat furniture in the Rockefeller collection were new, and a thoroughgoing effort was made to locate the eighteenth-century frames. In 1951 six of the original chairs and one settee were found in the Duveen Brothers warehouse, and the remaining half of the set turned up in 1965 at the Gothic Revival-style manor house Lyndhurst, in Tarrytown, New York. The last owner of this house had been Anna, duchess of Talleyrand-Périgord (1875-1961), the youngest daughter of the railroad magnate Jay Gould (1836-1892), who was an avid collector of French furniture.¹⁵ Having subsequently been acquired for the Rockefellers, the entire suite of seat furniture and tapestry covers eventually came into the possession of the Museum.¹⁶ Clothed once again in their original upholstery, the armchairs and settees serve as excellent reminders of the fact that French furniture was widely admired during the eighteenth century and served as elegant furnishings for residences all over Europe.

"This tapestry is one of seven hangings at The Cloisters that depict the hunt of the unicorn, a mythical creature first mentioned by the Greek physician Ctesias in the fourth century B.C. In the Middle Ages the animal was best known for its supposed invincibility and for the therapeutic property of its horn. So strong was the belief in the horn's miraculous cures that by the twelfth century the tusks of male narwhals, a small whale native to the Arctic, came to be regarded as ""unicorn horns.""The Unicorn Tapestries, as the group of seven is known, were probably designed in Paris but woven in Brussels. They are first documented in 1680, when they hung in the Paris home of François VI de La Rochefoucauld. By 1728 five of them decorated a bedroom at the family's château in Verteuil, in western France. The tapestries were looted during the French Revolution but were recovered in the 1850s; by 1856 they had been restored and rehung in the château's salon. No documentation sheds light on the early history of the tapestries, including either their commission or sequence of hanging. Striking differences in dimension and composition have prompted scholars to question whether the hangings constitute one set or are, in fact, from multiple sets.The Hunters Enter the Woods, like The Unicorn in Captivity, is set against a millefleurs background: a field of dark green spangled with blossoming trees and flowers. Of the 101 species of plants represented, 85 have been identified, including the prominent cherry tree behind the hunters and lush date palm in front of the sniffing hound. The cipher ""AE"" that is woven into each of the Unicorn Tapestries—and repeated here five times—alludes to their original owners, who remain unknown.",'animal_fibre'

"Floral velvets like this one are often referred to as jardinière velvets, using the French word for garden in reference to their bold, symmetrical floral patterns, or Genoa velvets, referring to the city where they were first produced. It is difficult to date this type of velvet precisely, as it was fashionable for formal interiors over a period of many years. The same type of design-large flowers and scrolling leaves symmetrically arranged to cover the entire width of a textile-also appears in monochrome damasks of the period.Velvet is distinguished from other flat textiles by its pile weave. This texture was created by an extra warp, in addition to the warp necessary for the background of the fabric. The pile warps were passed over small rods to create the loops of the pile. A polychrome velvet required as many extra sets of warps as it had colors in the pile, in this case four colors of velvet pile on a white satin background. Jardinière velvets usually had a combination of cut and uncut loops, giving further texture to the design. In this example, the combination of cut and uncut velvet on a smooth satin surface gives it an especially rich character, as all of the surfaces reflect the light differently.",'animal_fibre'

"This object is from the collection of Natalia de Shabelsky (1841-1905), a Russian noblewoman compelled to preserve what she perceived as the vanishing folk art traditions of her native country. Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments. Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.Russian bed curtains and towels were not only used for decorative purposes, but also provided an important role in ceremony. Bed curtains often adorned sleighs for weddings or carnival processions. Towels were draped over mirrors, trees, and temples, hung on walls, or used as offerings to the church in addition to their traditional uses. In wedding ceremonies the towel could be as large as six feet long and used to bind the couple together.",'animal_fibre'
"The story of Jacob as depicted in this set of six tapestries (1983.73.1–.6) begins with the scene of Esau selling his birthright to Jacob (Gen. 25:29–34). Esau, the hunter, sits with his bow and quiver at his feet. He clasps hands with Jacob, his brother, who is clad in the starred robe that will identify him throughout the story. By this handshake Esau and Jacob seal their agreement, and the former accepts a bowl of food in exchange for his birthright as firstborn. The secondary scenes represent different moments in time and serve to advance the story. In the center distance Esau is shown hunting with two dogs. To the right, Rebecca, mother of Esau and Jacob, is seen cooking outside the tent, probably preparing food for Jacob to present o his father, Isaac (Gen. 27). The narrative continues to unfold in the other tapestries, which depict Rachel giving her servant Bilhah to Jacob (Gen. 30:1–4), Rachel and Bilhah with her son Dan, and Jacob making a covenant with his father-in-law",'animal_fibre'

"Images of gardens were popular in the tapestry medium from the medieval era, where the so-called mille-fleurs (thousand flowers) (see also 2013.506) provided a decorative, and sometimes symbolic, setting for scenes of romance and play. Park and garden tapestries continued to enjoy popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly for the decoration of more intimate chambers, where they provided a pleasant contrast with the grander subject matter of tapestries used in more formal settings. The theme enjoyed new popularity with the advent of the Rococo style during the eighteenth century, and a number of highly decorative landscape and garden series were produced in French and Netherlandish workshops during the second third of the eighteenth century. Among the most notable was the series of romantic pastorals that Boucher designed for the Beauvais workshops between 1734 and 1736 (64.165.1–.8). Known as the Fetes Italiennes, and loosely inspired by the idyllic park scenes of Antoine Watteau, this series depicted handsome gentlefolk and peasants in idealized exterior settings.",'animal_fibre'

"""At eleven o’clock set out for the Thuilleries, to see the balloon go off; we soon quitted the coach, and it was with the greatest difficulty we got through the crowd on the Pont-royal to the little garden door. It was not long afterwards, that the Duke of Cumberland was in danger of being squeezed to death, as announced in all the public journals. The Queen of France sat in the balcony in front of the Thuilleries, appeared serious, and our party remarked, that she looked like a very handsome English woman. As soon as the aëronauts had taken their flight, I quitted the gardens.""[1] In his diary entry for December 1, 1783, Joseph Cradock (1742–1826) refers to the many spectators who watched a historic event take place that day: the first manned hydrogen balloon flight. The aeronauts Jacques-Alexandre-César Charles (1746–1823), a physicist, and his collaborator, Marie-Noël Robert (1760–1820), took off from the gardens of the Tuileries in a gondola suspended from a netted hydrogen balloon.Balloon-shaped and carved with netting, the finials of these side chairs, supplied for the queen’s boudoir at the Château des Tuileries in February 1784, celebrate Charles and Robert’s successful flight. Georges Jacob, one of the outstanding menuisiers of the ancien régime, provided the walnut frames, which he described as “of a new shape,” possibly referring to the arched top rail or the seat shaped like a horseshoe. The brothers Rousseau, who were decorative painters as well as sculptors, executed the delicate carving, each element of which is carefully detailed in their 1784 invoice. The chairs’ legs have the form of arrow-filled quivers, and the uprights of the back are shaped like fasces, or bundles of rods tied with ribbon, which symbolized power or authority in classical antiquity. The now little-known Presle, who advertised as “painter and gilder to the king,” gilded the frames. For certain details of the carving, such as the myrtle branches on the seat rails, a clear greenish tone of gilding was chosen to subtly contrast with the yellow gold used elsewhere.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010][1] Cradock 1828, vol. 2, pp. 38–39.",'animal_fibre'

"Part of a larger set, this remarkable corner settee and its pair, also in the Museum, were commissioned by one of the most powerful figures in eighteenth-century Franconia, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim (1708–1779). Prince-bishop of Würzburg and, after 1757, also of Bamberg, Seinsheim divided his time between two official residences in those cities and his three summer castles, Veitschöchheim, Werneck, and Seehof.[1] Preferring the country to the city, Seinsheim spent about three months a year outside Bamberg, at Seehof, where he enjoyed walking and hunting. He was fond of gardens and did much to embellish the late-seventeenth-century castle and especially its park, where he ordered that a maze, a theater, and a cascade with grotto and trelliswork arcades be constructed.In 1761 he also resumed work on one of the ancillary buildings at Seehof, the Franckenstein Schlösschen. This garden pavilion at the east end of the orangery and greenhouses had been conceived as a place where the prince could retreat from the strict etiquette at his court. Built by the architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel (1703–1769) for one of Seinsheim's predecessors, Johann Philipp Anton von Franckenstein, prince-bishop from 1746 to 1753, the Schlösschen had been left unfinished at the time of Franckenstein's death. Contemporary records indicate that Seinsheim decided to have its two main rooms, the Saal and the Audience Chamber (also called the Arbor Room, or berceau), embellished with frescoes and stuccowork. All four walls of the Audience Chamber were to be decorated as an illusionary arbor with trelliswork and floral festoons. Franz Anton Ermeltraut, court painter at Würzburg, was commissioned to execute a small trompe l'oeil ceiling fresco. It is not known when this was finished because the work was delayed by occasional disputes between the patron and the painter and the latter's frequent illnesses.[2] No description of the room's interior was made when the Franckenstein Pavilion was demolished in the nineteenth century, but a drawing thought to be Ermeltraut's design for the Arbor Room has been preserved, illustrating its intended decoration.[3] Also, an inventory of 1774 at Schloss Seehof mentions a ""Grünes Perceau-zimmer,"" or Green Trelliswork Room, in the garden pavilion, showing that the room had been completed by then as planned.Among the furnishings listed were the two settees, together with a pair of matching armchairs and four side chairs that are also in the Museum's collection.[5] In addition, there were four wall brackets hanging in niches, two of which have been preserved as well.[6] These furnishings were described as ""von bildhauer Arbeith grün Lassirt,"" or carved and glazed green.Both the settees and the matching chairs have serpentine gilded frames consisting of large scrolls of various shapes and openwork aprons decorated with polychrome flowers and foliage. They are supported on slightly curved legs carved with a pattern of reeds, and rest on bun feet that are partly covered by foliage. Most unusual is the off-white studded latticework intertwined with gilded and painted foliage on the inner backs of the seats; this must have been in total harmony with the original setting of the furniture. The outer backs of the settees and armchairs were left unfinished, as they were intended to stand against the wall; the side chairs, however, have latticework carving on both sides and were meant to be seen in the round. Corresponding to the inventory description of 1774, traces of a green glaze, originally applied over the gilding, are still present on the furniture.[7] Subsequent inventories offer additional details about the pieces, mentioning their green silk-velvet seat cushions and their placement.[8] Being rather top-heavy and unsteady, the settees stood in two corners of the room and the armchairs are described as being fastened in the other two. Grooves in the outer backs of the settees seem to imply that they too were once secured to the walls of the room.It is, unfortunately, not known who was the maker of this unique garden-room furniture so expressive of the exuberant Rococo taste. Its sculptural silhouette and elaborate carving, the choice of linden wood, and the unusual construction and simple joinery all make it seem likely that a sculptor or master carver rather than a cabinetmaker was responsible for the set.[9] It has been suggested that Margravine Sophie Caroline von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1737–1817), of neighboring Bayreuth, presented the suite to Seinsheim.[10] This would explain the absence of bills in Seehof's archival records. The margravine is known to have visited Seinsheim regularly, and pieces of furniture were occasionally exchanged between them. Also in favor of a Bayreuth provenance is the florid style of the pieces: Rococo furniture of Bayreuth was characterized by unrestricted use of naturalistic motifs, such as flowers, foliage, reeds, and birds. There was also a preference in Bayreuth for naturalism in interiors. Several rooms in the more recent of Bayreuth's two castles, the Neues Schloss, were decorated before 1760 in imitation of latticework pavilions, the first examples of their kind in Germany.[11] A complete set of furniture would have been an unusually large gift, however. Since the Museum's suite was in such perfect harmony with its original setting, and given Seinsheim's attention to the smallest details of Seehof's embellishments, it seems more likely that the prince-bishop ordered it himself. With the exception of a corner settee in the Würzburg Residenz, no other pieces known today bear even the slightest resemblance to the Seehof set.[12] For this reason, and in the absence of contemporary documents, it is impossible to attribute the furniture to a specific artist.The settees, chairs, and wall brackets presumably remained in the Franckenstein Pavilion until it was pulled down, between 1867 and 1870, and were then transferred to the castle itself. Seehof, which was in the possession of the bishopric and then part of the Bavarian royal domain until 1842, had become the private property of Freiherr Friedrich von Zandt and his descendants. Photographs taken at the turn of the century and later show the furniture in the Zandt family dining room.[13] They indicate that large carved flowers, now missing, originally adorned the cresting of the frames. The castle survived World War II intact, but the interior furnishings were sold off after the death in 1951 of the last male heir of the Zandt family.[14] In 1956 the Munich antiques dealer Fischer-Böhler sold this exceptional seat furniture to the New York collector Emma A. Sheafer. At that time the chairs and settees were upholstered in eighteenth-century painted Chinese silk, and only the trelliswork carving on the outer backs of the side chairs was left uncovered. Mrs. Sheafer never knew the full splendor of the furniture that filled the dining room of her New York City apartment. It was with their painted silk show covers that the furniture came to the Museum as part of her bequest in 1973. Once the fabric had been taken off, a conservation campaign was undertaken. This included the reconstruction of the foliage around the inner edge of the frames, which had been cut away to accommodate the upholstery; the removal of later paint layers on the trelliswork; and the manufacture of seat cushions covered in velvet to match the originals.[15][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide 2006]Footnotes:[1] Much of the information in this entry is taken from Kisluk-Grosheide 1990.

They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, pp. 171–72.[8] See the inventories of 1802, room 57B, and 1817–18, p. 37, no. 2A, transcripts of which are kept in the archives at Schloss Seehof.[9] Linden wood was more often used for sculpture than for furniture during this period. Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately.

"Tapestry-woven upholstery for two settees and twelve armchairs was commissioned at the same time as the wall hangings depicting the Four Continents (1978.404.1–.4).¹ The Four Continents was one of two suites・each including four wall tapestries and coordinating seating furniture・that were ordered from Beauvais in 1786; the subject of the other suite was to be a series illustrating the arts, sciences, agriculture, and commerce. An earlier suite of tapestry furniture covers depicting the continents was produced at the Royal Manufactory of Gobelins in 1748, and the arrangement of the motifs in Le Barbier’s covers is similar: personifications of the continents are set against a landscape on the seat backs, and native animals populate the seat covers.² This subject in tapestry aligns with the contemporary popularity of the Four Continents in eighteenth-century European art: everything from porcelain table decorations and tablewares to dinner napkins and ceiling frescoes incorporated personifications of the continents (see MMA 64.101.1347, 1348). The settee showing America and Europe emphasizes the close relationship between France and the new United States, which France promoted so forcefully in the tapestry depicting America. The figure of France occupies the center of the sofa back, and America is seated off to the left. In this composition, France is ‘introducing the new nation to Europe across Neptune’s domain, the Atlantic; France’s discarded armor lies at her feet, as the war has been won, and Victory crowns her.’³ The armchairs repeat the female personifications of each continent, attended by male figures and some of the fauna typically associated with each. There are three variations on each of the four continents, and, although they are all slightly different, the iconographic program is consistent. It appears that this upholstery was not affixed to furniture frames until sometime after 1852, decades after its production.⁴ Usually, a client commissioned or purchased high-quality tapestry upholstery before furniture frames were made to accommodate the weavings. This type of upholstery was quite popular in the late eighteenth century, and the Beauvais manufactory made many such sets.⁵ However, the combination of matching wall hangings and seating furniture was more unusual, and clearly more expensive. A suite of furnishings would have been reserved for a formal room, such as a salon or drawing room.

The marvel of this original design is that it identifies not only the artist but also the weaver, Peter Lekeux, and gives the date of sale -- October 23, 1747 -- as well.  In addition, the metal threads to be used in the weaving are described: ""dark yellow plate"" (a plain, metal strip); ""light yellow plain"" (a metal strip wound around a silk or linen core); and ""grey frosted"" (a textured thread that sparkles).

It is possible the sampler maker embroidered the letters to commemorate a sibling’s marriage. If this is the case, ""T"" would be the initial of the sibling’s first name and ""HK"" the initials of the spouse’s full name.

"This casket, the largest in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection of embroidered boxes, contains a multitude of objects, from glass bottles, which were typically fitted into boxes of the period, to a large array of sewing implements and materials, including 25 paper thread winders made from folded playing cards, several ivory thread winders, a bodkin, three ivory embroidery tools, a spool of gold filé thread, a silk tassel, several loose skeins of silk thread, a silk needle case, and a piece of detached buttonhole stitch fabric. Some of the objects clearly do not match the casket’s seventeenth-century date. Thread, both dyed silk and metal varieties, was purchased by weight, and the number of objects devoted to the organization of threads speaks to the value of this material. Decorated boxes intended to store sewing implements, among other things, were known on the Continent as well as in England; several seventeenth-century Dutch cushion-shaped containers survive, and seventeenth-century genre paintings confirm their practical use as supports for sewing.The completion of a decorated casket or cabinet would have been considered the culmination of a young woman’s education in needlework skills, and a few boxes have survived that can be firmly attributed to schoolgirls. Martha Edlin’s dated embroidered objects form the most complete record we have of one person’s output in the seventeenth century (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), although professional contributions at any point in the work would certainly have been possible. The exuberance of the decoration and the rather indiscriminate combination of materials and techniques suggest that this casket is the work of an amateur. Contrast this with the cabinet illustrating scenes from the Life of Joseph (MMA, 39.13.3a-k), which was executed in a single technique (laid and couched silk) and precisely and evenly worked on all faces of the box. This casket also lacks the consistency of theme present on most cabinets; the top of the lid shows the meeting of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, whereas the side panels are apparently random combinations of motifs typical of the period: heraldic animals, a castle, and a fountain, all surrounded by oversized flora and fauna. It is possible that the embroidered panels of this casket may have been applied to the wood carcass at a date significantly later than the execution of the decoration. The carcass itself is too large for the embroidered panels; the gaps where the satin foundation fabric does not cover the wood are patched with more silk and disguised with metal bobbin lace. The color and style of the lining—green silk with a padded main compartment—differ from most other boxes of the seventeenth century as well. Another casket in the Lady Lever Art Gallery collection has a similar padded interior, but the silk lining is described as the typical salmon-pink color.Nevertheless, this casket is important for its possible association with a mirror in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection (MMA, 39.13.2a). The back of the mirror frame is marked with the initials A.P. and the date 1672, and the casket contains thread holders or winders and a metal bodkin marked with the same initials. Both of these objects were in the collection of Percival Griffiths, and early scholars assumed that they were the work of the same maker. Although the mirror frame displays a more skilled and certain command of techniques and materials, it does contain some unusual elements, such as actual shells used in the decoration of the grotto. G. Saville Seligman and Talbot Hughes mentioned ""Lady Ann Paulet, who was a very accomplished broiderer"" in association with these embroideries, possibly referring to a lady-in-waiting to Queen Mary II (1662–1694), but no other evidence exists to support this attribution. The uncertain date of the construction of the casket, along with the survival of various tools and accessories, speaks to the continued significance of embroidery in the lives of women beyond the seventeenth century.[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'

"This armorial tapestry celebrates the Greder family of Solothurn (Switzerland), many of whom served in the French army. It was probably commissioned by François Laurent Greder (1658-1716) between 1691, when he became a brigadier and 1694, when he was made a knight of the Order of Saint Louis. The dramatic use of the swans to flank the armorial is an allusion to the swan feet that form part of the Greder arms. The tapestry does not bear the marks of the major French Royal Gobelins or Beauvais manufactories; it is not as technically proficient as the works woven in those workshops. For example, it was woven in two pieces that were subsequently sewn together (the seam is visible along the center vertical). Instead, it was probably woven either in the Lorraine region of France or in one of the smaller, less-organized commercial weaving workshops in Paris, such as that of Louis and Jean Baptiste Hinard, or of Gilles Bacor.",'animal_fibre'

"The canvas ground of this spot sampler is a crowded, asymmetrical flurry of ornamental designs; these include fauna, such as birds, snails, a boar, and butterflies; a variety of fantastic flora in the form of flowering and fruiting branches and stylized blossoms known as slips; and geometric interlacing patterns similar to those of newly fashionable ""knot"" parterres, designs for which were first published in England by Thomas Hyll in his Proffitable Art of Gardening (1568). The sampler is divided roughly into two parts, with the natural world presented at the top and geometric motifs below.Spot samplers may have come closest to fulfilling the etymological destiny of the sampler, or exemplar, as ""an example to be imitated; a model, pattern; an archetype."" They are composed of collections of patterns and stitches to which the maker might refer when she was in need of inspiration or guidance for a particular technique. They generally do not include a date or a name in the body of the work that would allow a connection to be made with an embroiderer at a certain point in her education.A. J. B. Wace cited the existence of samplers as early as the beginning of the sixteenth century, writing that one was purchased for Elizabeth of York, who died in 1503, and that Elizabeth, Countess of Oxford, who died in 1537, left her two sisters twelve samplers in her will, although it is not clear that these were the work of her own hand. The earliest extant English sampler is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum; it was inscribed and dated by Jane Bostock in 1598. A sampler with a very similar composition to the present example composed of tent-stitch slips and animals above a group of geometric designs worked in silk and metal threads, is also in the Victoria and Albert Museum (inv. no. T.234-1928). Spot samplers were originally dated to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century, but more recently they have been reassigned to the mid-seventeenth century on the basis of a group of dated spot samplers that Carol Humphrey has brought to light. Spot samplers are relatively rare survivals compared to seventeenth century band samplers, which may result from their continuing usefulness as pattern references, a function that would have worn them out. The fact that these are rarely dated or signed may indicate that some are the work of professional teachers or embroiderers, in which case they would not have been treasured and saved by the descendants of the makers in the same way as ""schoolgirl"" accomplishments. Nevertheless, early in their existence they were certainly valued by the women who actually referred to them. The manner in which the maker of this sampler used materials and the fact that several individual motifs in this piece were left half-finished suggest that this is the first draft of a final work. Once the maker had mastered the technique and produced enough of the design to judge the final effect, there was no need to waste precious materials, particularly metal threads, and time in completing the motif.Geometric patterns similar to those found on this sampler were used on small purses and other decorative accessories; a cushion in the Colonial Williamsburg collection (inv. no. 1967-62), for example, is decorated with a similar diamond-shaped motif. It has been suggested that the tent-stitch motifs, or slips, on spot samplers were intended to be cut out and applied to another ground fabric for the production of valances, bed hangings, or cushion covers. It seems more likely that these were intended to be saved as design ideas rather than used in another end product. Surviving unused slips suggest that when these were worked in any quantity for use in appliqué, they were organized methodically in rows of identical motifs, rather than squeezed into the available space at different angles of orientation.[Emily Zilber, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'

His methods encompassed streamlined production, fair pricing, and global marketing.

"This contemporary creation represents a revival of a precolonial textile tradition developed by Merina weavers on the island of Madagascar.  In the nineteenth century, the royal court and aristocracy of the ruling Merina people of the central highlands used elaborately patterned silk textiles, known as lamba akotofana,  During that period, King Radama I introduced the Chinese silkworm to the island.  Just as silk was associated with the emperor and with Christianity in Ethiopia, in Madagascar it was identified with royalty and immortality.  Given its strength and durability, it was conceived of as especially suited for apparel for the afterlife.  Such costly cloths were worn by members of the elite on important occasions as marks of status.  They were also drawn upon for the outer layer of fabric wrapped around notable ancestors as second burial shrouds.The Merina and Betsileo people are the main silk weavers in Madagascar.  Until recently weaving was a female vocation.  In order to weave bands of complex pattern, Merina weavers adapted their looms to include one or more supplementary heddles suspended above.  Each of these could then be manipulated to produce a band of pattern floating across the warp of the textile.  Many of these patterns are derived from local trees and flowers.  Predominant among them are believed to be variations on ""The Tree of Life"" motif.During the colonial period, patronage of such works by the local aristocracy gradually came to an end.  In recent years an innovative group of weavers from the town of Arivonimano, near the capital Antananarivo, have studied historical works conserved in the collection of The British Museum as a point of departure for renewal of their heritage.  Among them is the master weaver Martin Rakotoarimanana who produced this work for display.  It is not a literal replica of a historical prototype but rather an inspired departure that reflects the same demanding mastery of the medium achieved in the nineteenth century.",'animal_fibre'

"In 1964, Loretta Hines Howard generously presented to the Museum over 140 Neapolitan crèche figures, dating from the second half of the eighteenth century. The varied assortment includes figures from the three traditional scenes of a complete Neapolitan presepio: the Nativity, with angels, shepherds, and sheep; the procession of the three Magi, with their colorful retinue of attendants; and the varied and gay crowd of country and town people thronging the tavern, or inn, of Bethlehem — the diversorium mentioned by St. Luke, where on the Holy Night there was no place for Mary and Joseph. Averaging between twelve and fifteen inches in height, according to the position they were to take in perspective in the stage set, the figures are pliable and can be given poses at will, according to their facial expressions. Their bodies are made of tow and wire, their arms and legs are finely carved of wood, and their heads and shoulders are modeled of terracotta and accurately finished. Their attire, often enriched by accessories, jewels, and embroideries, is a sheer joy for the lover of folklore and eighteenth-century costumes.According to a tradition that seems to be supported by stylistic comparisons with figures in the collections of Naples and in the vast holdings of the Bavarian National Museum in Munich, some of the winsome heads of the Howard angels are to be credited to the best eighteenth-century masters: Giuseppe Sammartino (1720–1793), well known for his monumental sculptures in marble and in stucco, his pupils Salvatore di Franco, Giuseppe Gori, and Angelo Viva, and one Lorenza Mosca (d. 1789), who was employed at the Royal Porcelain Factory at Capodimonte and stage director of the Royal Christmas Crib.Since Mrs. Howard's gift, the Museum has recreated the Neapolitan Christmas crib scene, much to the delight of visitors during the holiday season.",'animal_fibre'

Flowers are often associated with the goddess, as a headdress and held in her hands, or replacing her head and hands. The minor goddesses on horseback flanking the great goddess also have rounded bellies with the addition of a flower motif on the belly.",'animal_fibre'
"Ecclesiastical garments were meant to contribute to the sense of mystery and awe associated with worship; this beautifully crafted dalmatic and maniple exemplify that practice. The depiction of the saints is artfully rendered, the skin tones expressed in applied silk with facial features and other details, such as hair and the definition of fingers depicted in embroidery. The monk's costume is recreated in particularly fine detail, down to the knotted cord chinstrap on his hat. The saints have been identified as St. Bonaventure, in Franciscan habit, wearing a cardinal's hat and holding a book and crosier, and St. John the Baptist in a brown camel's hair tunic and red mantle, holding Lamb of God and a banner. This dalmatic and maniple are part of a set that includes a cope (2009.300.3410), a two chasubles (2009.300.2949 and 2009.300.2952a–c) and a second dalmatic (2009.300.3411a, b).",'animal_fibre'

"Band samplers are composed of horizontal rows (""bands"") of embroidered patterns stitched along the woven linen foundation fabric. The shape of this band sampler is unusual, as it is square rather than rectangular, long to ensure that many bands can be stitched. Many of the patterns stitched onto band samplers can be traced to sixteenth-century pattern books, and often include depictions of fruit, flowers, and geometric patterns. This undated and unsigned sampler consists of three bands, the last of which includes ""boxers,"" male figures who flank a floral motif and hold a ""trophy,"" in this case a bird. The figure of the boxer is probably derived from the motif of a lover offering a flower to his beloved, which is also found in a number of sixteenth-century pattern books.",'animal_fibre'
"Embroidered in China with a dragon roundel at its center and four distinctive figures dressed in European garments in the surrounding field, this coverlet reflects the two disparate worlds of East and West and the contradictions that arose from artistic exchange between them. The men wear breeches and doublets, whose style and cut generally conform to late sixteenth- and early seventeenth century European dress.¹ Yet these Western garments, depicted with detailed embroidery, bear certain characteristic Chinese motifs: one man has a dragon design on his doublet, while another’s costume shows a typically Asian auspicious motif of intersecting diamonds within a diagonal lattice. In addition, the men’s features—including wispy mustaches and beards—have an Asian character. While the embroiderer may have intended to represent Portuguese gentlemen, there is a certain mixing of imagery and types here that is seen in other decorative arts of the period that depict foreigners, such as the painted Japanese Namban screens showing the ""barbarians"" arriving in Japan.²The basic design of the coverlet, which at some point was lined in a vibrant clamp resist-dyed silk from India (MMA 1975.208a-c), consists of a central roundel in a field surrounded by one or more borders; although this layout is frequently seen in works made for export, it also appears in domestic Chinese kang (daybed) covers.³ Its imagery—including dragons flanking a flaming jewel, the birds and flowers of the border, and the Chinese-style lions in each corner—is common in Chinese textiles. Some of the details, however, are unusual, or are combined in unexpected ways, suggesting the involvement of a European trader or client unfamiliar with the selection and placement of motifs in Chinese iconography. The jewel between the dragons, for example, is uniformly surrounded by flames, resembling a Western sun more than the characteristic Asian flaming jewel. And the lotus pond at one edge of the border, which would normally be the backdrop for pairs of waterfowl, such as ducks or egrets,⁴ instead features large pheasants, more often depicted in a dry, rocky setting.

"By the mid-eighteenth century, French silks made in Tours, Nîmes, and above all Lyon dominated taste Europe-wide, increasingly surpassing Italian work. Such was the demand for colorful and naturalistically decorated furnishing silks like this example, as well as asymmetrically patterned dress silks, that it has been estimated that there were approximately 8,000 looms in Lyon by 1739. More than one third of the city’s inhabitants was involved in the silk industry as weavers and, more tangentially, spinners, dyers, merchants, and retailers.  This silk was displayed in European Textiles and Costume Figures, on view at the School of Industrial Arts in 1935, and at Walton High School in 1939.[Elizabeth Cleland, 2020]",'animal_fibre'

"This chasuble is from a set of six vestments—also including a stole, maniple, burse, chalice veil, and chalice cover—whose quality, extent, and provenance make the group an important addition to the Museum's fine collection of ecclesiastical costume. The chasuble's embroidered decoration-a nearly symmetrical pattern of full-blown, seminaturalistic flowers, small blossoms, curving leaves, and scrolls—is an excellent example of the style of late Baroque ornament used to embellish Italian vestments from the end of the seventeenth century to the middle years of the eighteenth. The robust flowers, worked in long and short stitches, French knots, and metallic loops, are carefully modeled in four to five shades of silk. The metallic thread is primarily used in laid and couched work, cursively following the contours of the motifs and secured in twill or chevron patterns with yellow silk. Although it is often impossible to identify the specific place of manufacture of such embroideries, documentation accompanying this gift proposes western Sicily. Attestations given in 1915 in Partanna and Mazara del Vallo state that according to tradition this set of vestments was a gift to Nicolo Spedaliere (also recorded as Spitaleri), head priest of the mother church of Partanna, from his bishop. Furthermore, the superior of the Collegia di Maria, which was founded in 1681 in Mazara del Vallo, avers that since that time schools and women's religious orders have existed throughout the diocese in which embroidery like this example as well as other types were practiced.",'animal_fibre'

"Small-scale devotional tapestries like this one were popular among the most elite collections of Europe. One buying trip for twelve such textiles cost Queen Isabella of Castile the equivalent to ten years of the salary she paid the ship’s master on Christopher Columbus’s transatlantic voyage in 1492. A tapestry comparable in size and subject to this one belonged to Isabella’s granddaughter, the Habsburg Queen Catherine of Portugal. The sixteenth-century appeal of this tapestry lay in the skill of its weavers—who rendered the folds of Veronica’s mantle in silver thread, tackling the challenging effect of watery reflections—and in its compelling design. The life-size Veronica, head overlapping the border, seems to step out of the textile and into our space.[Elizabeth Cleland, 2017]",'animal_fibre'
"Velvets like this were used for clothing, religious vestments, and altar dressings, as well as for wall coverings and cloths of honor. The thick, light-reflecting, tactile pile, which differentiates velvet from other silks, was achieved during the weaving process by using rods or wires to loop up warp threads rather than pull them tight and flat. This sumptuous example, which incorporates glittering strips of silver lamella running from selvedge to selvedge, is of a type popularly described as “cloth of silver” from the sixteenth century onward. This cloth of silver was displayed in European Textiles and Costume Figures, on view at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences (visible at far right in the photograph of 1938), and at Walton High School (visible at center right in the photograph of February 9, 1939).[Elizabeth Cleland, 2020]",'animal_fibre'
"Images of gardens were popular in the tapestry medium from the medieval era, where the so-called mille-fleurs (thousand flowers) (see also 2013.506) provided a decorative, and sometimes symbolic, setting for scenes of romance and play. Park and garden tapestries continued to enjoy popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly for the decoration of more intimate chambers, where they provided a pleasant contrast with the grander subject matter of tapestries used in more formal settings. The theme enjoyed new popularity with the advent of the Rococo style during the eighteenth century, and a number of highly decorative landscape and garden series were produced in French and Netherlandish workshops during the second third of the eighteenth century. Among the most notable was the series of romantic pastorals that Boucher designed for the Beauvais workshops between 1734 and 1736 (64.165.1–.8). Known as the Fetes Italiennes, and loosely inspired by the idyllic park scenes of Antoine Watteau, this series depicted handsome gentlefolk and peasants in idealized exterior settings.",'animal_fibre'

In 1380 Muscovite armies, following the image on a battle standard, defeated the Mongols at the famous battle of Kulikovo. This elegant later work demonstrates the icon’s continuing importance to the Muscovite court.",'animal_fibre'
"This tapestry was part of a set of twelve celebrating courtly pastimes, each dedicated to a month of the year. Here, the ripened fruits and vintage traditionally associated with autumn are evoked by a lady and gentleman sampling wine and a boy feasting on grapes. In the middle ground, a pair of lovers meet under a simple trellised arbor, beautifed by abundant trusses of ripe fruit. Behind them, vintners press grapes and barrel wine, while in the distance, dancing peasants celebrate the end of the harvest. April, from the same series, is on display nearby.Though woven in eighteenth-century Paris, these hangings were designed after a sixteenth-century Netherlandish tapestry set (now lost) in the French royal collection. The resulting works winningly combine a Renaissance sensibility in subject matter, compositional style, and clothing fashions with a lush Rococo border, a rainbow palette, and virtuosi weaving techniques more typical of 1730s France.",'animal_fibre'
"This sofa and two armchairs (1987.62.2, .3) are from a set of furniture that also included a daybed, six side chairs, and two additional armchairs. The set was designed by the Bolognese architect Filippo Pelagio Palagi, who in 1832 was commissioned by Carlo Alberto, king of Sardinia, to redecorate his royal palaces. One of these palaces was at Racconigi, and Palagi designed this set of furniture for the principal drawing room next to the royal bedroom.The armchairs and sofa are distinguished by the sculptural treatment of the crest rails and by the quality and refinement of the veneering. The set of furniture was executed by Gabrielle Cappello, whose workshop produced many of Pelagi's designs for Racconigi.

"Though this tapestry’s edges have been cut, very little of its design is missing, except for a likely border. A hardly visible inscription gives voice to the grimacing, gesticulating, jeering crowd, thronging around the barely clothed figure of Jesus Christ: “ECCE HOMO”- ‘Here is the Man’- is woven in gilded silver metal-wrapped threads immediately below his representation, as if hovering in front of the patterned balustrade. The architecture’s veined marbles and carved ornamentation, and the myriad textures of clothing, all create effects of rich patterning characteristic of established tapestry design conventions. The tapestry’s claustrophobically cropped, half-length composition and sharply receding perspective, on the other hand, have as much in common with early Netherlandish panel painting. Indeed, this tapestry is based upon a painted design executed in multiple versions in the workshop of the painter, Quentin Metsys; one of the most well-known examples is in the collection of the Museo del Prado, Madrid. As such, this is one of a sizeable group of smaller-scale devotional tapestries (like 06.301 also at The Met) produced by talented weavers almost certainly working in Brussels- the center of excellence for figurative tapestry weaving throughout the later fifteenth and the sixteenth centuries- probably made on speculation for sale on the open market. Representing the scene recounted in the Biblical book of John, 19:5, when the Roman governor, Pontius Pilate, showed the arrested Christ to the people, mockingly crowned with thorns, just before his execution, this subject matter was ideal for the tapestry’s privileged owner to contemplate and use as a devotional tool, meditating on the narrative of Christ’s sacrifice.",'animal_fibre'

"This suite of four tapestries and its coordinating upholstery (MMA 1978.404.4a-c–.18a–c) were commissioned from the Beauvais manufactory in 1786 and woven between 1790 and 1791.¹ As has been noted, ""The attractive and not impossible suggestion that the set was intended to be a gift from King Louis XVI to George Washington was made by the first scholar to publish the work . . . but it is not supported by any contemporary evidence.""² Regardless of whether the suite was intended as a gift to President Washington, the French Revolution intervened, and it is perhaps miraculous that the tapestries were woven at all. By the time they were complete, the French king was in no position to bestow diplomatic gifts on anyone. It is the representation of America as a rather demure-looking young woman that sets this iconographic scheme apart from other groupings of the Four Continents. In the Beauvais tapestry set, America has evolved from the scantily clad, spear-toting, armadillo-riding, cannibalistic warrior princess seen in sixteenth century representations to the woman dependent on the protection of the female personifications of Liberty and Minerva (whose shield carries the fleur-de-lis of France).³ In addition to this representational shift, the Indian princess who had originally stood for the entire Western Hemisphere here represents only the United States. The concept for this view of America defended by France in the guise of Minerva was suggested by none other than Benjamin Franklin, and a medal based on his suggestion was designed by Augustin Dupre and struck in France in 1782.⁴The production of these tapestries is thus a vivid example of the Gallic enthusiasm for the American colonists’ struggle for independence from Great Britain, France’s longtime foe, which existed at the highest levels of society. This was not the first American subject for the designer of the series, Jean-Jacques- Francois Le Barbier (an official peintre du Roi by 1780). In 1782 his illustration of the first Continental Congress appeared as the frontispiece in Essais historiques et politiques sur les Anglo-Américains (Brussels, 1781–82), just one of several publications on the subject of the American cause that appeared in the early 1780s.⁵ Of course, the French expressed their enthusiasm for the American struggle against the British with more than works of art and propaganda. They supported the Continental Army with money, supplies, and soldiers, including the wealthy marquis de Lafayette (1757–1834), whose fervor for the cause was so great that he sailed to America disguised as a woman to escape detection.

"Sumptuous velvets, such as this example, were among the most highly prized luxury fabrics of the Renaissance. Utilizing variations on a relatively small number of decorative motifs, most notably the pomegranate, palmette, artichoke, and garland, these silken-pile textiles developed from earlier fifteenth-century subtle voided patterns, formed by the appearance of the ground fabric where there was no pile on the surface, into visually and technically more complex designs. Here, the symmetrical pattern of elaborate artichoke forms within lobed compartments surrounded by ogivally arranged intertwined leaves and flowers is woven with metal thread, and some details are executed with metal loops (bouclé) for additional texture. The jewel-tone silk velvet primarily forms the background, which, in areas, has a subtle ""sculpted"" leaf pattern achieved by juxtaposing two different heights of the velvet pile.Woven in Italy—particularly Florence, Venice, and Genoa—and in Spain, velvets were coveted throughout Europe and also in Turkey, where production demonstrated reciprocal influences, especially with Venetian weavings. This particular example exhibits Eastern influence in the crenate collar or clip motif that secures the garlands. Contemporary paintings, inventories, and extant examples clearly indicate the international appeal of velvets and their varied uses: from ecclesiastical vestments to caftans and European-style garments for the very wealthy, to opulent furnishings, cloths of honor, and diplomatic gifts.",'animal_fibre'

"Jacques-Louis David was First Painter to the emperor, but Napoleon did not like the official coronation portrait that David painted during the autumn and winter of 1805. Instead, he preferred a portrait that François Gérard had prepared in 1805 for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It shows Napoleon in the Throne Room of the Tuileries Palace, the seat of the empire. The emperor commissioned a number of repetitions to give to prominent officials, such as his grand-chamberlain, the duc de Tallyrand, and to his numerous brothers and sisters, whom he had installed on thrones throughout western Europe. It is no longer certain which of the many versions of Gérard's portrait was the first, although it may be the canvas now at the Château de Versailles.In 1808, Napoleon ordered the imperial tapestry works to execute a woven copy of his favorite portrait, thereby aligning himself with the royal tradition of tapestry patronage that extends back to the Middle Ages. A painted replica could have been produced quickly and with little expense, but tapestry was much more time-consuming and costly, and therefore considerably more precious. Eight weavers worked for three full years to make this tour de force. It was presented to the arch-chancellor of the empire, Jean-Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, four days after it was completed on March 7, 1811.In their depictions of Napoleon in his imperial robes, David and Ingres both strove to create novel imagery consonant with the new regime.

"On a visit to the royal palace of Fontainebleau on September 14, 1787, Arthur Young described Marie-Antoinette’s then recently redecorated boudoir as a delicious little room with exquisite painting, observing that “nothing can exceed the extremity of ornament that is here with taste bestowed.”[1] Designed by the architect Pierre Rousseau (1751–1829 ), the queen’s boudoir at Fontainebleau is, indeed, a jewel box of a room. Its large mirrors alternate with shimmering mother-of-pearl-like boiserie painted by Michel-Hubert Bourgeois and his assistant Jacques-Louis-François Touzé with lighthearted arabesques and flowers. An important aspect of the interior decoration was the matching seat furniture supplied by Georges Jacob and clearly intended to harmonize with the gold and silver tones of the decor. This screen’s gilded frame incorporates silvered highlights, now much worn, such as the wisps of ivy trailing around the uprights shaped like burning torches. The overall unity in the design of the room and its furnishings was also expressed through the subtle repetition of certain decorative motifs. The cupid’s bow and wreath of roses, symbols of love, carved on top of the fire screen, for instance, recur in gilt bronze on the mantelpiece, where they are combined with ivy. The motif of a string of pearls pulled through a spiraling ribbon is used not only to embellish the screen but to frame the wall paneling of the room as well.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010][1] Young 1792, pp. 55–56.",'animal_fibre'
"This extremely rare hanging combines an exquisitely well-preserved palette with the distinctive long and narrow format of a wainscot tapestry. In a style referred to by Flemish weavers at the time as ""English fashion"", it was intended to hang between the cornice and the dado of a wood-paneled room. The tapestry is attributed on stylistic, iconographic and technical grounds to Flemish immigrant weavers who sought refuge from the religious tumult of the era by relocating to England, probably London. In excellent condition, it is a particularly engaging example of the output of this fascinating and only recently studied diaspora of weavers from Flanders. The tapestry is notable for its weavers' remarkable use of color in the construction of forms and effects of light and cast shadow. The idyllic landscape contrasts vistas of pastoral relaxation with a hunting scene, flanking a central moated building. Representative of the magpie spirit which circumstances demanded of these weavers, rather than working from a brand new design, the elements of the tapestry cartoon have been artfully assembled around a reused design source: the central manor house takes its inspiration from a woodcut representing King Solomon's Palace by the Swiss artist, Jost Amman.",'animal_fibre'

"The same 1789 inventory [of Saint Cloud] mentions a much larger set of furniture that had been commissioned from Georges Jacob two years before for the Salon des Jeux du Roi, or King's Gaming Room, at Saint Cloud. Jacob, one of the most successful chair makers of the eighteenth century, supplied sixty-two pieces of furniture, including sixteen identical armchairs, for this room where fortunes were won and lost at the gaming tables. According to the detailed account, Jacob charged 24 livres per armchair for cutting the walnut to shape and joining the various parts together. The carving, by an unidentified carver, cost 180 livres, and the gilding, by Louis-François Chatard, amounted to 240 livres. A paper label pasted underneath the frame of an armchair in the Metropolitan (fig. 58) identifies it as having been ordered in February 1788 for the gaming room at Saint Cloud. The notches cut underneath the frame next to the maker's stamp indicate that it is the third of four chairs that were ordered from Georges Jacob at that time, to supplement the set he had supplied the previous year. These formal chairs with straight backs, called fauteuils meublants, would have been placed along the walls of the room together with the settees and bergères of the set. The rectilinear frame of the armchair, with its curved front seat rail, scrolled arm supports, and turned straight legs all carved with guilloches, rosettes, and stylized leaves, is the epitome of neoclassicism. The 1789 inventory describes the upholstery on the set as a gray blue brocaded gros de Tour, or ribbed silk. Much of the gaming room seat furniture, including twelve of the armchairs, was still recorded at the palace in the spring of 1798. The Museum's chair was eventually acquired by Georges Hoentschel. The 1908 catalogue of his collection lists its Saint Cloud provenance but not its maker or date.",'animal_fibre'
"In a woodland setting, three men and three women dance in a ring. A pile of musical instruments lies in front of them on the bank of a stream. For centuries, these bucolic figures have been called shepherds and shepherdesses, although there are no attributes specifically identifying them as such. This tapestry is from a set of eight, traditionally called Les Sujets de la Fable. The designs for all eight tapestries are based in part upon drawings then in Louis XIV's collection- now preserved in the Louvre- which were all, at that time, attributed to Giulio Romano. Four of the tapestries in this series- all of which are part of The Met’s collection- ultimately take as their inspiration frescos by Giulio Romano and his assistants in the Palazzo Te, Mantua. The design source of this tapestry is Giulio’s fresco depicting folk born under the constellation of the Goat celebrating its ascendency, painted in the Palazzo’s sala dei venti.",'animal_fibre'
"This design was commissioned in the early 1770s as part of the decoration for a salon in the Palais Bourbon in Paris. Ten years later, in the early 1780s, it was used again in the Grand Palace in Peterhof, the country residence of the Russian empress Catherine the Great. In the Peterhof Palace, the textile was used in a boudoir that was decorated en suite, meaning that the same textile was used for the walls, furniture covers, and curtains. It was a popular pattern, and in addition to the Museum's piece with a pale blue background, examples with different background colors such as red, green, and yellow exist in other museum collections in the United States and Europe.The work of designer and entrepreneur Philippe de Lasalle came to the attention of Catherine the Great through their mutual acquaintance, the philosopher Voltaire. In 1771, Lasalle produced several woven portraits of reigning monarchs, including Louis XV of France and Catherine the Great. Voltaire owned one of the portraits of Catherine and praised its likeness in a letter to her. Examples of Lasalle's designs were sent to the empress and she became a patron. The partridge silk was one of several Lasalle fabrics subsequently imported for the Russian palaces. Lasalle was also commissioned to design wall hangings to commemorate an important military victory which were hung in the Chesma Palace, and another silk showing peacocks and pheasants was used in what became known as the Lyon Drawing Room in the Czarsko Selo Palace.",'animal_fibre'

"This object is from the collection of Natalia de Shabelsky (1841-1905), a Russian noblewoman compelled to preserve what she perceived as the vanishing folk art traditions of her native country. Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments. Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.In 19th-century Russia the swastika was a heraldic symbol along with the imperial eagle.

"The repeating pattern of stylized flowers arranged in a fan shape within an arch in red and gold on a shaded green ground reflects Christopher Dresser's interest in Japanese textiles, while it also fulfills his requirements for good textile design. Dresser argued that textiles, unlike pictorial art, were only suited for flat, ornamental design. As he elaborates in Principles of Decorative Design (1873), ""The ornamentist when enriching a fabric deals only with a surface, and has no thought of placing pictures thereon; he has simply to enrich or beautify that which without his art would be plain and unornamental.""This pattern was shown at the 1871 International Exhibition in London, and illustrated in the accompanying Art-Journal Catalogue, where it was advertised as ""Very beautiful and not extremely costly fabrics for upholstering purposes, manufactured by Messrs. J. W. and C. Ward of Halifax, from the designs by Dr. Cornelius [sic] Dresser, who has done much excellent work not only in Art-decoration but also in the inculcation of the principles on which it rests.""Many of the firms who produced Dresser's textile and carpet designs believed in his abilities as a designer. All in the Halifax region, a fair number of them, including John Lewis, John Whitely Ward, John Crossley and his brother, and John Lister, also commissioned Dresser to design the interiors of their homes. Unfortunately, only two commissions survive: Allangate Mansion, circa 1870 for Thomas Shaw, MP, and Bushloe House for Hiram B. Owston, Dresser's lawyer, built sometime between 1866 and 1880, survive. Both houses are in very poor condition and leave only clues to the total composition of Dresser's interiors.",'animal_fibre'

William Morris had founded the workshop at Merton, in Surrey, near London, in 1881 as part of his vision to use the integrity of medieval craftsmanship to revitalize the art and design of postindustrial Britain.

"As its full-size domed canopy is suspended from the ceiling rather than supported on posts, this tester bed, which bears the stamp of the menuisier Georges Jacob, is a type called lit à la duchesse en impériale. Its original but now fragile hangings, woven in 1782–83 at the Beauvais tapestry manufactory after designs by Jean-Baptiste Huet (1745–1811), have been replaced by modern silk damask, except for the lining of the interior dome. French eighteenth-century beds tended to be lofty, as it was customary to pile them with three or more mattresses filled with straw, wool, horsehair, or feathers. Tobias Smollett (1721–1771) noted in 1766, “French beds are so high, that sometimes one is obliged to mount them by the help of steps.”[1]The custom of receiving visitors while reposing in a large and elegantly fitted out bed was practiced in France during the eighteenth century mostly by aristocratic women. The Museum’s imposing piece of furniture with its exquisitely carved floral decoration, the work of an unknown carver, must have formed a splendid backdrop for such official calls or congratulatory visits. In 1791 the bed is documented as standing in the large bedchamber of Guyonne-Marguerite de Durfort de Lorge, duchesse de Choiseul-Praslin (1737–1806), at her Parisian home, the Hôtel de Belle Isle. Following the turmoil of the Revolution and the political changes of the early nineteenth century, the bed was sold in Paris in 1830. It became part of the famous collections at Hamilton Palace, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the residence of Alexander Hamilton Douglas, tenth Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852), where it was placed in one of the state rooms. The duke’s grandson sold the contents of the palace, including the bed, at a highly anticipated auction that took place in 1882. Through the intermediation of several dealers, the bed was acquired in 1897 by the financier and railroad executive George J. Gould (1864–1923). His wife, the former actress Edith M. Kingdon (1864–1921), used it in her bedroom of their New York town house.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010]Footnotes:[1] Tobias George Smollett. Travels through France and Italy. London, 1766.

"Silk-embroidered linen covers were common furnishings in Iberian households. The proportions of this example indicate that it was used over a table rather than on a bed. The floral designs—elegant Renaissance-style scrolling vines with carnations, irises, and other flowers as well as hummingbirds seeking nectar—are constructed with brilliant yellow silk embroidered on a natural linen ground (outlines in brown tannin ink, drawn for the embroiderers to follow, are still visible in some areas). The golden yellow color, a favorite in Iberia for textiles, was derived from weld, a local dyeplant that thrived in the region and was relied on for its brilliance and durability.¹ Although the contrast between the yellow silk and the ecru ground echoes that of certain Indian embroideries made in Bengal and imported into Portugal and Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (see MMA1975.4, MMA 23.203.1), the ease of the design and the variety in stitch type (including satin, chain, and stem as well as various kinds of knots and filling stitches) help identify this as a European cover. The configuration of the cover’s decorative elements constitutes a basic format that may have originated in Islamic Spain. In particular, the large central field with a series of outer borders, including a broad center border flanked, or ""protected,"" by narrower guard borders on either side, was an established style for carpets throughout the Islamic world and one that influenced other regional textile designs, notably Spanish embroidery (the demarcation of the four outer corners in this example may, however, be more Iberian than Islamic in character). This design approach, in turn, was transmitted around the world via Spanish and Portuguese colonial administration and trade, from tapestries made by Andean weavers in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Peru (see MMA 56.163) to Asian and Indian embroideries intended for the European market (see MMA 1975.208d). Given the shared heritage of Portugal and Spain, especially during the sixteenth century, when both countries were united under a single ruler, it can be difficult to differentiate the embroidery production of one from the other.² Both regions had longstanding traditions of fine textiles, from folk works to commissions made by professional guilds for the Church and royal court. This example lies somewhere in between: although the cover was intended for actual household use, its intricate style and high quality suggest that it was made for a person of means and status.

"This tapestry is part of four hangings that have been reconstructed from what originally was a set of three tapestries depicting the Nine (or Ten?) Worthies.  The heroes depicted included King Arthur, Joshua, David, Hector of Troy, and Julius Caesar, along with various attendants.  One of the reconstructed hangings (32.130.2b, 47.101.1, 47.152) shows two of the three Hebrew Worthies in their settings and with nearly all of their attendant figures.  Another represents King Arthur (32.130.2a, 47.101.4), one of the three or possibly four figures that appeared in the original tapestry devoted to the Christian Worthies, together with some attendant figures.  The third and fourth pieces represent respectively Hector of Troy (47.101.2) and Julius Caesar (47.101.3), with attendant, taken from a third tapestry that depicted the three Pagan Worthies.  Other fragments (47.101.5 and 49.123), showing architectural elements, bits of landscape, and the incomplete figures of three cardinals and a bishop, all apparently unconnected to those parts of the three original hangings that survive, are preserved separately in the Metropolitan Museum.",'animal_fibre'
"Though small in size, this rich devotional tapestry, woven with virtuoso technique in the priciest of raw materials, embodies the highest end production associated with early sixteenth-century Brussels. Complementing its physical appeal was the caliber of its designer, Bernard van Orley, wo was admired official court painter to both Margaret of Austria and, subsequently, Mary of Hungary. With fleeting movement, gorgeously observed draperies billowing, the three kings launch themselves into this scene, as if having just strode into the tapestry from behind its left and right borders. This is a more dynamic version of a design van Orley also executed in oil on panel in a painting now in the collection of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Van Orley, or a member of his workshop, also explored this composition in a related and extended scene in The Met’s drawing (2014.100) itself, apparently, a design for a larger tapestry.",'animal_fibre'
"Part of a larger set, this remarkable corner settee and its pair, also in the Museum, were commissioned by one of the most powerful figures in eighteenth-century Franconia, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim (1708–1779). Prince-bishop of Würzburg and, after 1757, also of Bamberg, Seinsheim divided his time between two official residences in those cities and his three summer castles, Veitschöchheim, Werneck, and Seehof.[1] Preferring the country to the city, Seinsheim spent about three months a year outside Bamberg, at Seehof, where he enjoyed walking and hunting. He was fond of gardens and did much to embellish the late-seventeenth-century castle and especially its park, where he ordered that a maze, a theater, and a cascade with grotto and trelliswork arcades be constructed.In 1761 he also resumed work on one of the ancillary buildings at Seehof, the Franckenstein Schlösschen. This garden pavilion at the east end of the orangery and greenhouses had been conceived as a place where the prince could retreat from the strict etiquette at his court. Built by the architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel (1703–1769) for one of Seinsheim's predecessors, Johann Philipp Anton von Franckenstein, prince-bishop from 1746 to 1753, the Schlösschen had been left unfinished at the time of Franckenstein's death. Contemporary records indicate that Seinsheim decided to have its two main rooms, the Saal and the Audience Chamber (also called the Arbor Room, or berceau), embellished with frescoes and stuccowork. All four walls of the Audience Chamber were to be decorated as an illusionary arbor with trelliswork and floral festoons. Franz Anton Ermeltraut, court painter at Würzburg, was commissioned to execute a small trompe l'oeil ceiling fresco. It is not known when this was finished because the work was delayed by occasional disputes between the patron and the painter and the latter's frequent illnesses.[2] No description of the room's interior was made when the Franckenstein Pavilion was demolished in the nineteenth century, but a drawing thought to be Ermeltraut's design for the Arbor Room has been preserved, illustrating its intended decoration.[3] Also, an inventory of 1774 at Schloss Seehof mentions a ""Grünes Perceau-zimmer,"" or Green Trelliswork Room, in the garden pavilion, showing that the room had been completed by then as planned.Among the furnishings listed were the two settees, together with a pair of matching armchairs and four side chairs that are also in the Museum's collection.[5] In addition, there were four wall brackets hanging in niches, two of which have been preserved as well.[6] These furnishings were described as ""von bildhauer Arbeith grün Lassirt,"" or carved and glazed green.Both the settees and the matching chairs have serpentine gilded frames consisting of large scrolls of various shapes and openwork aprons decorated with polychrome flowers and foliage. They are supported on slightly curved legs carved with a pattern of reeds, and rest on bun feet that are partly covered by foliage. Most unusual is the off-white studded latticework intertwined with gilded and painted foliage on the inner backs of the seats; this must have been in total harmony with the original setting of the furniture. The outer backs of the settees and armchairs were left unfinished, as they were intended to stand against the wall; the side chairs, however, have latticework carving on both sides and were meant to be seen in the round. Corresponding to the inventory description of 1774, traces of a green glaze, originally applied over the gilding, are still present on the furniture.[7] Subsequent inventories offer additional details about the pieces, mentioning their green silk-velvet seat cushions and their placement.[8] Being rather top-heavy and unsteady, the settees stood in two corners of the room and the armchairs are described as being fastened in the other two. Grooves in the outer backs of the settees seem to imply that they too were once secured to the walls of the room.It is, unfortunately, not known who was the maker of this unique garden-room furniture so expressive of the exuberant Rococo taste. Its sculptural silhouette and elaborate carving, the choice of linden wood, and the unusual construction and simple joinery all make it seem likely that a sculptor or master carver rather than a cabinetmaker was responsible for the set.[9] It has been suggested that Margravine Sophie Caroline von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1737–1817), of neighboring Bayreuth, presented the suite to Seinsheim.[10] This would explain the absence of bills in Seehof's archival records. The margravine is known to have visited Seinsheim regularly, and pieces of furniture were occasionally exchanged between them. Also in favor of a Bayreuth provenance is the florid style of the pieces: Rococo furniture of Bayreuth was characterized by unrestricted use of naturalistic motifs, such as flowers, foliage, reeds, and birds. There was also a preference in Bayreuth for naturalism in interiors. Several rooms in the more recent of Bayreuth's two castles, the Neues Schloss, were decorated before 1760 in imitation of latticework pavilions, the first examples of their kind in Germany.[11] A complete set of furniture would have been an unusually large gift, however. Since the Museum's suite was in such perfect harmony with its original setting, and given Seinsheim's attention to the smallest details of Seehof's embellishments, it seems more likely that the prince-bishop ordered it himself. With the exception of a corner settee in the Würzburg Residenz, no other pieces known today bear even the slightest resemblance to the Seehof set.[12] For this reason, and in the absence of contemporary documents, it is impossible to attribute the furniture to a specific artist.The settees, chairs, and wall brackets presumably remained in the Franckenstein Pavilion until it was pulled down, between 1867 and 1870, and were then transferred to the castle itself. Seehof, which was in the possession of the bishopric and then part of the Bavarian royal domain until 1842, had become the private property of Freiherr Friedrich von Zandt and his descendants. Photographs taken at the turn of the century and later show the furniture in the Zandt family dining room.[13] They indicate that large carved flowers, now missing, originally adorned the cresting of the frames. The castle survived World War II intact, but the interior furnishings were sold off after the death in 1951 of the last male heir of the Zandt family.[14] In 1956 the Munich antiques dealer Fischer-Böhler sold this exceptional seat furniture to the New York collector Emma A. Sheafer. At that time the chairs and settees were upholstered in eighteenth-century painted Chinese silk, and only the trelliswork carving on the outer backs of the side chairs was left uncovered. Mrs. Sheafer never knew the full splendor of the furniture that filled the dining room of her New York City apartment. It was with their painted silk show covers that the furniture came to the Museum as part of her bequest in 1973. Once the fabric had been taken off, a conservation campaign was undertaken. This included the reconstruction of the foliage around the inner edge of the frames, which had been cut away to accommodate the upholstery; the removal of later paint layers on the trelliswork; and the manufacture of seat cushions covered in velvet to match the originals.[15][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide 2006]Footnotes:[1] Much of the information in this entry is taken from Kisluk-Grosheide 1990.

They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, pp. 171–72.[8] See the inventories of 1802, room 57B, and 1817–18, p. 37, no. 2A, transcripts of which are kept in the archives at Schloss Seehof.[9] Linden wood was more often used for sculpture than for furniture during this period. Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, p. 169.[10] This was suggested by the Munich dealer Fischer-Böhler.[11] Kisluk-Grosheide 1990, pp. 156–57, fig. 23.[12] Heinrich Kreisel attributed the Würzburg settee to Johann Köhler, an otherwise unknown sculptor, who was paid for ""sculptural work [and/or] carving executed in the newly furnished chamber in the princely residence""; Kreisel 1930, pp. 29–30.

"Portraits from the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries are replete with minutely detailed representations of garments and accessories decorated with emblematic motifs. The gauntlets of these gloves are embroidered with motifs which also appear on other objects made in the late Elizabethan era—a disembodied eye raining pale blue and silver tears, a colorful pansy flower, and a bright green parrot with pearls on its wings. The weeping eye is related to a contemporary emblem book, Henry Peacham's Minerva Britanna, or A Garden of Heroical Devises of 1612, though this motif was known as a symbol of unrequited love well before the publication of Peacham's book.The pansy, watered by the tears of the weeping eye, was a popular flower in the Elizabethan era. It was known to be a favorite of the queen herself and the pansy continued to appear in embroidery well into the seventeenth century.Despite the present fragile and somewhat degraded condition of these gloves, they retain enough of their sumptuous embroidery to convey the luxury of the highest quality needlework of the late Tudor and early Stuart era.",'animal_fibre'

"The settees and chairs illustrated here (see 1974.356.114–.121) were made for the Franckenstein Pavilion in the gardens of Seehof Castle near Bamberg, one of the three summer residences in Southern Germany used by Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, prince bishop of Würzberg and Bamberg. A true garden enthusiast, it was under von Seinsheim that the gardens of Seehof were embellished, which must have resembled the still extant Rococo gardens completed by von Seinsheim at Veitshöchheim. His love for gardens and garden imagery also carried over into the interior decoration and furnishings of his castles, as the Seehof furniture demonstrates. A unique example of German Rococo furniture executed in a more flamboyant style than its French prototypes, the ensemble was designed specifically for the Garden Room in the Franckenstein Pavilion. Used as an audience room, it was referred to as the ""Green Trellis Chamber"" in the 1774 Seehof inventory and painted entirely with trompe l'oeil trellis and foliage. The garden room's furniture was made to match: the backs of the chairs and settees are richly carved in the form of garden trellis-work with colored flowers and foliage.",'animal_fibre'

In addition to geometric designs that are of the type that would have been used to decorate small purses, cushions, and other accessories, the sampler includes ""slips,"" motifs that would have been worked in tent stitch and then cut out and appliqued onto larger pieces of work that would have been too large and unwieldy to embroider on their own.

"In this triptych, Ringgold combines language and imagery to structure her complex, fantastical narrative of survival and redemption set in an apartment building in Harlem. By 1983, Ringgold had immersed herself in a new art form, story quilts, which seemed a natural progression from her painting, fabric sculpture, and performance art. With story quilts, this activist artist—concerned throughout her career with issues of feminism and race—creates a new expression that acknowledges cultural and personal history. Domestic arts—sewing, quilting, weaving—have long been associated with women, and quilting reflects the folk traditions (and the struggles and achievements) of Black women. For Ringgold, the fact that her mother was a dressmaker and fashion designer adds another evocative layer of meaning and history to an already loaded medium. Storytelling, too—the expression of narrative—carries dense referents with legends, tales, even jokes associated with African-American community life and oral history.In Street Story Quilt, one stylized Harlem facade—a grid of fifteen windows—is depicted three times at different moments in a story that transpires over decades. Handwritten text fills panels above each window. In the first panel, ""The Accident,"" a character named Grace narrates the story of ten-year-old A.J. and his grandmother, Ma Teedy, who have just witnessed a car accident that kills A.J.'s mother and four brothers. The central panel, ""The Fire,"" depicts the devastating effects of a blaze inadvertently set by A.J.'s drunken father, who dies in the fire. Text reveals that ""A.J. ran away from home right after big Al's funeral. He was picked up a few days later for sellin dope to a cop."" The traumas continue, one compounding the other, but through it all, Grace notes: ""Say what you want 'bout Ma Teedy but she was a real woman … I like her because she a survivor. Always keep herself and her family lookin good.""The final panel is ""The Homecoming,"" in which A.J., now a man who has fully redeemed himself and become a successful writer and actor, returns to the scene to pick up his grandmother and take her back to California with him. Grace describes her insights: ""I knew that boy was special from the day he was born. He was just different, with his badness. Peoples used to talk bout him after his Ma died, then his Pa died and he had to run and hide from the Mafia. That's that kick in the ass the black man gets. But A.J. done made that kick into a kiss.

"With subtlety and dexterity, this tapestry's weavers- who apparently used the monograms AR and ICM- borrowed, enlarged, reversed, and added color to Hans Schäufelein’s design for the Pentecost woodcut in Ulrich Pinder’s Speculum Passionis, published in 1507.This panel is part of a group of similarly sized scenes from the New Testament, woven across more than two decades, all closely based upon printed prototypes by Albrecht Dürer, Hans Baldung Grien, Martin Schongauer and Hans Wechtlin, as well as by Schäufelein.

"Beginning in the twelfth century, the Tuscan town of Lucca and the Adriatic port of Venice dominated European silk weaving, which subsequently spread to Genoa, Florence, and Milan. Spanish silk weavers, long established in Granada and Valencia, were, by the 1500s, emulating their Italian counterparts. Raw silk, imported from the Near East or cultivated locally, was spun, dyed, spooled, and woven within family workshops under the patronage of wealthy, sometimes noble, silk manufacturers. This crimson silk damask was displayed in Arms, Armor, and Textiles: 1492–1776, on view at the George Bruce branch, New York Public Library (visible at far right in the photograph of 1934), and later in European Textiles and Costume Figures, at Walton High School (visible at far right in the photograph of February 16, 1939).[Elizabeth Cleland, 2020]",'animal_fibre'
"This tapestry depicts the gods Apollo and Diana killing the children of Niobe as a punishment for the affront that Niobe had caused their mother, Latona. The set from which this panel derived was known as ""The Horses"" because the mythological subjects were a thinly veiled pretext to depict a sequence of splendid horses in dynamic action. The designs were created by Francis Cleyn, a native of Rostock who worked at the Danish court before traveling to England in the early 1620s. He was appointed official designer to the Mortlake tapestry works in 1625, and during the following decade provided a sequence of new design series, including ""The Horses."" Two high-quality weavings of this subject were provided to Charles I before 1637, of which only one fragment survives (Victoria and Albert Museum, London). Following the Civil War, the Mortlake works continued to weave from Cleyn's designs, but these later weavings lacked the quality of materials and skilled craftsmanship that characterized earlier production.This set was woven sometime in the 1650s or 1660s for Henry Mordaunt, second earl of Peterborough, whose arms appear in the upper border, along with those of his wife, Penelope O'Brien.",'animal_fibre'
"Presenting musicians, acrobats, and exotic animals within a fanciful architectural setting, this tapestry is from a set known as the Berain Grotesques, in reference to the pervasive stylistic influence of Jean Berain (1640–1711), who may even have provided preliminary sketches. The lighthearted subject matter and whimsical design contrast with the heavier, ornate style that had characterized French tapestry during the third quarter of the seventeenth century. The series enjoyed immense popularity during the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, and the Beauvais workshop produced many weavings for French clients.",'animal_fibre'

"The earliest British charity schools for poor and orphaned children were founded around the country by local gentry, to support and educate children whose families lived in the vicinity. In the eighteenth century, the number of institutions increased significantly. Arguably the most famous of these is the Foundling Hospital in London established by Thomas Coram in 1741; the charity still exists today as the Thomas Coram Foundation for Children. Most of these small samplers were monochrome; made to be included in a book of stitching exercises. This more colorful example might have been made into a pincushion or other decorative item to be sold as a fund raiser for the school.",'animal_fibre'

"The binding of this 1649 Bible printed by the Company of Stationers and Book of Psalms printed by Richard Cotes is decorated with two scenes from the Old Testament. The front cover shows Elijah and the Widow of Zarapeth (1 Kings 17:8–16), and the back cover shows Elijah Fed by Ravens (1 Kings 17:1–6), two episodes in the life of the prophet when God provided for him by sending sustenance from unlikely sources, ravens and a poor widow. Although not as common as other biblical scenes rendered in needlework, the numerous depictions of the story of Elijah in paintings and engravings show how familiar these stories would have been to their seventeenth-century audience. Yvonne Hackenbroch suggested a likely source for the front of the embroidered cover in Gerard de Jode’s late sixteenth-century Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamentis, although some of the costumes were updated from this source to reflect contemporary fashion.Two factors lead to the conclusion that this decorated binding is the work of an amateur: the level of proficiency of the embroiderer and the presence of initials, presumably those of the maker. The techniques and materials employed are fewer and simpler than are commonly seen on Bible covers of a professional caliber; the two scenes from the life of Elijah are worked in tent stitch on canvas, which would have been made separately and then applied to the satin background of the book binding. The scenes are then framed in a cartouche of silk-wrapped purl thread, which is applied in a couching technique that would be relatively simple to work. A knot stitch is used on the satin background to make the floral border and the maker’s initials M.B., as well as the spine, which is covered in six registers of flora and fauna. Although tedious to work in this quantity, the stitch is not terribly difficult. The fact that this Bible and Book of Psalms were decorated by an amateur embroiderer shows that the skills so important to a young woman’s education were put to use in the making of decorative objects necessary to a properly appointed household.Like cabinets decorated with raised-worked panels, the finished cover would probably have been delivered, along with the book itself, to a binder who specialized in the application of decorative covers. The same craftsman may have applied the decorative silver metal trim to the edges, as well as the gold metal clasps. The publication date of a book cannot be used as conclusive evidence for the date of any type of cover. However, it is probable that books intended to receive decorative textile covers were intentionally constructed with smooth spines, in order to facilitate the application of the cover and to avoid interrupting the design, unlike the spines with protruding cords, which are commonly found on leather bound books of the period. Nevertheless, the embroidery design on the spine imitates the appearance of leather bindings with the horizontal cords and panels in between.[Katy Reed-Basham and Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'

"The settees and chairs illustrated here (see 1974.356.114–.121) were made for the Franckenstein Pavilion in the gardens of Seehof Castle near Bamberg, one of the three summer residences in Southern Germany used by Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, prince bishop of Würzberg and Bamberg. A true garden enthusiast, it was under von Seinsheim that the gardens of Seehof were embellished, which must have resembled the still extant Rococo gardens completed by von Seinsheim at Veitshöchheim. His love for gardens and garden imagery also carried over into the interior decoration and furnishings of his castles, as the Seehof furniture demonstrates. A unique example of German Rococo furniture executed in a more flamboyant style than its French prototypes, the ensemble was designed specifically for the Garden Room in the Franckenstein Pavilion. Used as an audience room, it was referred to as the ""Green Trellis Chamber"" in the 1774 Seehof inventory and painted entirely with trompe l'oeil trellis and foliage. The garden room's furniture was made to match: the backs of the chairs and settees are richly carved in the form of garden trellis-work with colored flowers and foliage.",'animal_fibre'

"This tapestry illustrates the legend of Veronica’s veil, an episode from a twelfth-century French epic poem, La Vengeance de Nostre Seigneur (The Vengeance of Our Lord), an amalgam of apocryphal sources from the first century which tell of the Roman Emperor Vespasian’s campaigns in Jerusalem. The poem was popularized in the fourteenth century as the subject of mystery plays. Portrayed at center, Veronica has been brought to the Emperor Vespasian, who kneels before her, in order to cure him of his illness. Veronica holds the cloth with which she had wiped perspiration from Christ’s face as he carried the cross on the road to Calvary. Christ’s image was transferred to the cloth along with his miraculous healing powers.

The colorful stylized tulips and carnations arranged in rows of alternating diagonals imitate the more elegantly stylized floral silks and velvets of Safavid Iran.

"Images of gardens were popular in the tapestry medium from the medieval era, where the so-called mille-fleurs (thousand flowers) (see also 2013.506) provided a decorative, and sometimes symbolic, setting for scenes of romance and play. Park and garden tapestries continued to enjoy popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly for the decoration of more intimate chambers, where they provided a pleasant contrast with the grander subject matter of tapestries used in more formal settings. The theme enjoyed new popularity with the advent of the Rococo style during the eighteenth century, and a number of highly decorative landscape and garden series were produced in French and Netherlandish workshops during the second third of the eighteenth century. Among the most notable was the series of romantic pastorals that Boucher designed for the Beauvais workshops between 1734 and 1736 (64.165.1–.8). Known as the Fetes Italiennes, and loosely inspired by the idyllic park scenes of Antoine Watteau, this series depicted handsome gentlefolk and peasants in idealized exterior settings. In this case, a pretty young woman, a child, and a gardener rest in the shade of an overgrown terrace, beneath statues of Apollo and Hercules.",'animal_fibre'

Its appearance is in sharp contrast to textiles produced in earlier periods. The earlier pieces exhibit a lighter, more delicate palette of minty greens, light blues and a heavy use of golden metal-wrapped threads.",'animal_fibre'
"Improvements in English domestic glass production in the second half of the century coincided with the fashion for raised-work embroidery and resulted in the production of some of the most spectacular examples of embroidered household furnishings of the seventeenth century.The three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the creative use of materials on this example are very impressive. The tail feathers of the peacock are created from fragments of actual bird feathers, there are tiny shells and bits of coral in the grotto surrounding the fish pond, and the costumes of the courting couple include details such as real lace trimmings and seed pearls.The decoration of this mirror refers to a marital union, symbolized by the couple flanking the mirror glass, the two manor houses above them, and the figure of Harmony, in the guise of a young woman playing a lute, at the top of the mirror. The heraldic lion and leopard suggest that the owner was a loyal Royalist, as these animals appear on the royal coat of arms as well.",'animal_fibre'
"In terms of both design and technique these wall panels exemplify the highest quality furnishing textiles of the late eighteenth century. Part of a major decorative commission executed by Jean Démosthène Dugourc, they were intended to decorate the Billiard Room of the Casita del Labrador in Aranjuez, the rural pleasure palace built for King Charles IV of Spain between 1791 and 1803. The panels were woven by Camille Pernon, premier producer of luxury silks in Lyon. The central embroidered landscapes, based on paintings of the countryside surrounding Arunjuez, were probably applied after the panels were delivered to Spain.Dugourc, who was raised at Versailles, was named dessinateur du Garde-Meuble de la Couronne in 1784. From 1786 he also worked for the decoration of a number of rooms at the Casita del Labrador. These panels are a strong statement of his eclectic use of motifs, in this case taken from Raphael's decorations for the Vatican Loggia, which were in turn inspired by Roman wall paintings. These two unused panels in pristine condition convey the daring color of Dugourc's scheme in a way that the faded panels preserved in situ at Aranjuez cannot.",'animal_fibre'

"The Museum's set of six armchairs and two settees from the Tapestry Room at Croome Court, Worcestershire, formerly the seat of the earls of Coventry, is among the best documented of all English Neoclassical furniture.¹ It was executed by the leading London cabinetmakers, John Mayhew and William Ince² who in 1769 billed the owner of Croome, George William, the sixth earl (1721-1809), for ""6 Large Antique Elbow Chairs, with oval Backs, Carv'd with Double husks & ribbon, knot on top, Gilt in the Best Burnish'd Gold, Stuff'd with Besthair, in Linen, Backt with Fine Crimson Tammy, proper for Covering with Tapistry in the Country, the patterns included. 2 Settees for Each Side the Chimney, richly Carv'd & Gilt, Stuff'd & Cover'd to match the chairs. 10 Setts of Castors, with Screws, & fixing to the Chairs & Sofas.""³ The floral cartoons for the furniture covers were executed from 1760 to 1767 at the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris by Maurice Jacques (1712-1784) and the decorative artist Louis Tessier (1719/20-1781).  In England this was the first instance in which seat covers were designed en suite with a set of tapestry hangings, which were intended to be used rather like wallpaper, covering the walls from chair rail to cornice. The tapestries had a series of trompe l'oeil medallions with scenes designed by François Boucher (1703-1770) representing allegories of the elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. The tapestries were finally installed in June 1771 by Mayhew and Ince: ""Three Men's time at Croome putting up the Tapestry."" This was the first of several sets of this group of tapestries, called the Tentures de Boucher, woven at the Gobelins for English houses, of which the best known are the ones made for Osterley Park, Middle-sex; Newby Hall, North Yorkshire; Weston Park, Shropshire; and Moor Park, Hertfordshire (now at Aske, North Yorkshire). Between 1902 and 1904 the ninth earl of Coventry sold the tapestries and tapestry-covered furniture and recovered the walls with green damask. Subsequently the original seat covers were acquired by a dealer in Paris, who removed and applied them to a set of modern frames in the Louis XV style. The Tapestry Room from Croome Court was given to the Metropolitan Museum by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1958, together with the modern set of frames. In the following year the original frames were discovered in a warehouse in Paris. They were purchased by the Kress Foundation and shipped to the Museum, where they were refitted with their original tapestry covers.[William Rieder, adapted from European Furniture in The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Highlights of the Collection/ Daniëlle O.

"This tapestry with its rich and complex imagery is the fourth in a series of ten expounding the story of Christ’s redemption of mankind. The series reveals, on the one hand, mankind’s fall from grace and its inability to resist temptation in spite of the assistance offered by the Virtues, and, on the other, Christ’s mission to reconcile mankind with God and thus achieve redemption. The content of these extended visual narratives is drawn from Christian scriptures as well as from medieval allegory, poetry, and drama, and is perhaps based ultimately on a mystery or morality play. Trees, flora, and waterways separate the various episodes. (The subjects are identified and the inscriptions translated in the line drawing.) The individual scenes in the tapestry have counterparts in contemporary panel paintings by Netherlandish artists, notably Rogier van der Weyden. It may be that the unknown designers of the series were painters or were active in a workshop that included painters. The quality and style of the weaving suggest that the series was created in Brussels. This tapestry and seven others from the series were in the collection of Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, bishop of Burgos from 1514 until his death in 1524.",'animal_fibre'

All three vestments bear the coats-of-arms of the De Vissher-van der Gheer and Van Culemborch families. The probable owner, Johannes De Vissher van der Gheer (ca.1527–1591), was canon of the Chapter Church of Saint Barbara at Culemborg and later vicar of the Chapter Church of Saint John at Utrecht. His motto, ""We are bent, not broken, by the waves,"" describes not only the bulrushes depicted below, but also perhaps the effects on the wearer of the tumultuous political and religious climate of the Netherlands in 1570. The depiction of the Israelites gathering the manna that sustained them in the desert prefigures the eucharistic host. This reference would be clearly apparent at the moment of the Consecration, when the priest, who at that time celebrated the Mass facing the altar with his back to the worshipers, raised the host on high.[Alice Zrebiec, 1996]",'animal_fibre'
"Representing spring and summer, fire and air, these hangings (MMA 46.43.1-.4) were part of a larger set that must also have included the two missing seasons and elements. This series included portraits of Louis XIV, his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, marquise de Montespan (1641 – 1707 ), and six of their children, all shown as deities. The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers. The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds. Various birds, insects, and wind instruments are rendered around this medallion, while a sunburst is shown above and Juno with peacock below. The closeness of the depiction of Louis XIV to an image of the king painted on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles by Charles Le Brun in 1683 – 84 makes it likely that the designs for the main figures in the set of hangings were supplied by his workshop; however, they may be the work of the painter François Bonnemer (1638 – 1689 ), who is known to have made cartoons after compositions by Le Brun. In 1685 Bonnemer provided designs for the embroidered seat covers of the benches and stools in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alentours, or decorative borders, full of delightful details, are believed to be by Jean Lemoyen le Lorrain, an artist little known today who worked in the circle of Le Brun.The other embroideries are thought to depict three of Montespan’s children with the king: Louise-Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes (1673 – 1743 ), with flowers symbolizing Flora, or spring (MMA 46.43.1); Françoise-Marie, Mademoiselle de Blois (1677 – 1749 ), with wheat ears, as Ceres, or summer (MMA 46.43.2); and Louis-Auguste, duc de Maine (1670 – 1736 ), in armor, as Mars, or fire (MMA 46.43.3).The compositions of the seasons include floral wreaths with the zodiac symbols for the appropriate months, while salamanders, torches, smoking braziers, and censers pertain to the element fire. The background of these rare surviving embroideries is worked in metal thread, now tarnished, which must have given them a sumptuous and shimmering appearance when they were first made. The hangings were documented in 1718 as in the collection of Louis-Alexandre, comte de Toulouse (1678 – 1737 ), the youngest child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, at the Château de Rambouillet. During the nineteenth century they belonged to King Louis-Philippe and were hung at the Palais Royal, Paris.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, adapted from The Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts/Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide and Jeffrey Munger; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010]",'animal_fibre'
"This tablecloth closely follows a tapestry set, known as the Loves of Gombaut and Macée, to represent the carefree, sexually enlivened lives of the shepherds Gombaut and Macée. Its border illustrates incidents taken from the first six tapestries of the set, embroidered in tent stitch using wool and silk in brilliant red, pink, blue, and dark blue-green colors. The tablecloth is also based on a set of eight woodcuts by John Le Clerc, made about 1587, which are thought to have been copied from the tapestry series. The widespread popularity of the story is apparent from the number of its depictions that have survived.The scenes shown extol the ideal pleasures of Arcadian life. Macée washes her feet in a stream and later raids a bird's nest with Gombaut in a scene taken from the first tapestry. Then they play tiquet, a game similar to croquet, and a man smacks a girl. A bagpipe player performs, the two shepherds dance, and they feast on biscuits, water, and strawberries in scenes taken from the third and fourth tapestries. Finally, Gombaut is betrothed to Macée and marries her in scenes from the fifth and sixth tapestries. Several scenes found in the tapestries are omitted in the embroidery, including the shepherds as children chasing butterflies and the onslaught of wolves that causes Gombaut's unfortunate death and concludes the story. Gombaut's later life is rarely shown in illustrations of the story; the sad approach of death is not in keeping with the idyllic pastoral theme. The harsh realities of peasant life were rarely acknowledged before the nineteenth century. The explanatory French verses, in the late fifteenth-century style, found on the tapestries and also on the woodcut prints are also absent from this tablecloth.",'animal_fibre'
"Patterns of scrolling vines, or rinceaux, with flowers, birds, and insects - like the design on this coif, or cap – were extremely popular in England in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. By the 1580s portraits of Queen Elizabeth I and several of her courtiers show the sitters wearing embroidered sleeves decorated with an early version of this pattern in monochrome thread (usually black) on white linen.¹  Examples like this coif, made of linen embroidered with polychrome silk and metal threads, were first produced about 1600. This popular scrolling pattern appeared on both men’s and women’s headgear, women’s jackets, and furnishing textiles. The design, which may derive from similar motifs found in Islamic Spain, remained fashionable in England at least until the 1620s.² Features like the small diaper patterns used to fill the interiors of individual leaves and flower petals in blackwork embroidery and the striped or shaded leaves and petals like those seen here continued to be employed in English crewel embroidery of the later seventeenth century. These features are also found in some of the earlier surviving Indian chintz patterns produced for export to Europe. English embroidery patterns and Continental verdure tapestries were sources that contributed to the creation of the lush floral designs seen in late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Indian chintz.³ A miniature version of a scrolling floral pattern appears in one of the earliest surviving Indian chintzes, found on the walls of the circa 1677 dollhouse of Petronella Dunois (1650–1695), now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (no. BK-14656)⁴  A sarasa for the Japanese market (see MMA 2010.55), another type of Indian cotton, also displays this type of pattern, and a much larger-scale variation that includes exotic animals appears on an Indian embroidered bedcover (see MMA 68.61).A number of ornament prints, such as the German artist Bernhard Zan’s design of 1581 (see MMA 20.8.1), could have served as models for European embroideries. Like the rinceaux design itself, ornament prints often had extended periods of use and were circulated and copied long after their original invention. While there is to date no concrete evidence that designs or textiles of this exact type were sent to Indian craftsmen to copy, the practice of sending patterns to India is well documented, and it seems likely that versions of such successful patterns as the European rinceaux with flowers influenced Indian textile production for the international market.

"During the early fifteenth century, European velvet design was largely characterized by the use of voided patterns formed where the pile was absent.  In the second half of the century, technical innovations led to the production of increasingly complex velvets in which the richness of design and texture were achieved through the use of different heights of cut pile and of supplementary metal threads.  In this example, the broad meandering vine and the stylized foliage are woven in metal-wrapped thread with some details in raised loops to give even greater tactile effect.",'animal_fibre'

"John Vanderbank was head of the Great Wardrobe workshop in London from 1689 to 1717, with responsibility for weaving and repairing tapestries for the British crown. During the early 1690s, he provided tapestries ""designed in the Indian manner"" for Queen Mary's apartments at Kensington Palace (the queen was an avid collector of Chinese porcelain).

"This suite of four tapestries and its coordinating upholstery (MMA 1978.404.4a-c–.18a–c] were commissioned from the Beauvais manufactory in 1786 and woven between 1790 and 1791. ¹ As has been noted, ""The attractive and not impossible suggestion that the set was intended to be a gift from King Louis XVI to George Washington was made by the first scholar to publish the work . . . but it is not supported by any contemporary evidence.""² Regardless of whether the suite was intended as a gift to President Washington, the French Revolution intervened, and it is perhaps miraculous that the tapestries were woven at all. By the time they were complete, the French king was in no position to bestow diplomatic gifts on anyone. It is the representation of America as a rather demure-looking young woman that sets this iconographic scheme apart from other groupings of the Four Continents. In the Beauvais tapestry set, America has evolved from the scantily clad, spear-toting, armadillo-riding, cannibalistic warrior princess seen in sixteenth century representations to the woman dependent on the protection of the female personifications of Liberty and Minerva (whose shield carries the fleur-de-lis of France).³ In addition to this representational shift, the Indian princess who had originally stood for the entire Western Hemisphere here represents only the United States. The concept for this view of America defended by France in the guise of Minerva was suggested by none other than Benjamin Franklin, and a medal based on his suggestion was designed by Augustin Dupre and struck in France in 1782.⁴ The production of these tapestries is thus a vivid example of the Gallic enthusiasm for the American colonists’ struggle for independence from Great Britain, France’s longtime foe, which existed at the highest levels of society. This was not the first American subject for the designer of the series, Jean-Jacques- Francois Le Barbier (an official peintre du Roi by 1780). In 1782 his llustration of the first Continental Congress appeared as the frontispiece in Essais historiques et politiques sur les Anglo-Américains (Brussels, 1781–82), just one of several publications on the subject of the American cause that appeared in the early 1780s.⁵Of course, the French expressed their enthusiasm for the American struggle against the British with more than works of art and propaganda. They supported the Continental Army with money, supplies, and soldiers, including the wealthy marquis de Lafayette (1757–1834), whose fervor for the cause was so great that he sailed to America disguised as a woman to escape detection.

"This object is from the collection of Natalia de Shabelsky (1841-1905), a Russian noblewoman compelled to preserve what she perceived as the vanishing folk art traditions of her native country. Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments. Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.The composition of the upper band suggests that the central form is a stylized representation of the goddess flanked by two minor goddesses on horseback. The goddess as tree of life symbol is often expressive of agricultural fertility. As Russia moved from hunting to an agrarian society, the horse became glorified through connection with the goddess. Though the design lacks other signifiers such as the presence of birds, it was likely an individual interpretation of the motif.",'animal_fibre'

"Tapestry-woven upholstery for two settees and twelve armchairs was commissioned at the same time as the wall hangings depicting the Four Continents (1978.404.1–.4).¹ The Four Continents was one of two suites・each including four wall tapestries and coordinating seating furniture・that were ordered from Beauvais in 1786; the subject of the other suite was to be a series illustrating the arts, sciences, agriculture, and commerce. An earlier suite of tapestry furniture covers depicting the continents was produced at the Royal Manufactory of Gobelins in 1748, and the arrangement of the motifs in Le Barbier’s covers is similar: personifications of the continents are set against a landscape on the seat backs, and native animals populate the seat covers.² This subject in tapestry aligns with the contemporary popularity of the Four Continents in eighteenth-century European art: everything from porcelain table decorations and tablewares to dinner napkins and ceiling frescoes incorporated personifications of the continents (see MMA 64.101.1347, 1348). The settee showing America and Europe emphasizes the close relationship between France and the new United States, which France promoted so forcefully in the tapestry depicting America. The figure of France occupies the center of the sofa back, and America is seated off to the left. In this composition, France is ‘introducing the new nation to Europe across Neptune’s domain, the Atlantic; France’s discarded armor lies at her feet, as the war has been won, and Victory crowns her.’³ The armchairs repeat the female personifications of each continent, attended by male figures and some of the fauna typically associated with each. There are three variations on each of the four continents, and, although they are all slightly different, the iconographic program is consistent. It appears that this upholstery was not affixed to furniture frames until sometime after 1852, decades after its production.⁴ Usually, a client commissioned or purchased high-quality tapestry upholstery before furniture frames were made to accommodate the weavings. This type of upholstery was quite popular in the late eighteenth century, and the Beauvais manufactory made many such sets.⁵ However, the combination of matching wall hangings and seating furniture was more unusual, and clearly more expensive. A suite of furnishings would have been reserved for a formal room, such as a salon or drawing room.

"Crowned and splayed double-headed eagles, symbols of the Habsburg dynasty, are woven into this Chinese textile, one of a large group of related examples made for the Portuguese and Spanish market in the last part of the sixteenth century. The group represents an early production for export of complex woven silks that integrate both Iberian and Asian aesthetics and design. In this example, the eagle holds in its talons arrows that pierce a heart-shaped vase. The device of a heart pierced by arrows is associated with the Augustinian religious order, while representations of floral vases were popular motifs in China. The conflation of pious and secular imagery seen here may be the result of free rein being given to the master weaver commissioned to produce the cloth. Although the pattern, colors, and general layout have a notable European character, a number of details point to an Asian hand in the design. The form of the oddly shaped leaf on the scrolling vines, for example, resembles Chinese floral patterns more than the European acanthus leaves we might expect to find, especially as associated with the grapelike fruit cluster motif that repeats throughout. Additionally, the stylized dark blue flowers are Chinese peonies; they alternate with the eagles, whose extended, erect neck feathers and patterned breasts recall the graphic means sometimes used by Chinese artisans to render the image of a phoenix. It could be that the weaver modified an original source (perhaps a European print) to incorporate these Asian elements within the overall European format. A related group of silks, possibly from a different workshop, shares some of the design features seen here, including the arrow-holding double-headed eagles amid scrolling vines, although in that group the eagles are contained within narrow vertical panels delineated by leafy borders. Multiple examples of textiles with this design exist; in general, they have the same crimson red (lac dye) ground and are decorated in two colors, blue and yellow. In addition to silk, these fine woven textiles incorporate flat threads of gold leaf on paper, typical of East Asian works.¹ A complete cope (Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto) and a portion of a chasuble (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) made of this fabric confirm that it was used in Christian ecclesiastical vestments.²  The exact location of production for this group of silks is unknown, but the combination of Iberian and Asian motifs and styles is typical of products exported through Macau, a major center of trade in the sixteenth century.Although other Macau silks possess similar design elements, the color scheme of this example, with its pattern of green, blue, and yellow, is distinctive.  It has been proposed, based on the motif of the arrow piercing the heart, that the fabric was made specifically for Augustinians active in the Philippines, but examples found in Spain, Portugal, and other European centers suggest it may have been part of the larger Iberian trade.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1.

"Images of gardens were popular in the tapestry medium from the medieval era, where the so-called mille-fleurs (thousand flowers) (see also 2013.506) provided a decorative, and sometimes symbolic, setting for scenes of romance and play. Park and garden tapestries continued to enjoy popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, particularly for the decoration of more intimate chambers, where they provided a pleasant contrast with the grander subject matter of tapestries used in more formal settings. The theme enjoyed new popularity with the advent of the Rococo style during the eighteenth century, and a number of highly decorative landscape and garden series were produced in French and Netherlandish workshops during the second third of the eighteenth century. Among the most notable was the series of romantic pastorals that Boucher designed for the Beauvais workshops between 1734 and 1736 (64.165.1–.8). Known as the Fetes Italiennes, and loosely inspired by the idyllic park scenes of Antoine Watteau, this series depicted handsome gentlefolk and peasants in idealized exterior settings.",'animal_fibre'
"The French statesman René-Louis de Voyer de Paulmy (1694 – 1757 ), marquis d’Argenson, observed in 1749 that the palace at Parma was bereft of everything; it had not a stick of furniture nor even a staircase. He predicted that much time would be needed to remedy these shortcomings. [1] No wonder, then, that the previous year Louise-Élisabeth, the eldest and favorite daughter of Louis XV, who with her husband, Don Philip of Spain, had been awarded the duchy of Parma, declined to settle in the empty shell. She traveled to her father’s court at Versailles instead, where she commissioned furnishings for her new home. Louise-Élisabeth (1727 – 1759) returned to northern Italy in October with thirty-four wagonloads of purchases and gifts. It is quite possible that this armchair was among the things she brought back at that time.Part of a large set of seat furniture made in Paris but assembled, gilded, and upholstered in Parma, this chair has been attributed to Nicolas-Quinibert Foliot and was possibly executed after a design by the architect and designer Pierre Contant d’Ivry. The Foliots were an important family of chairmakers active in mideighteenth-century Paris and employed by the Garde-Meuble de la Couronne, the royal office that supplied furniture to the French court.An unknown sculptor executed the high-relief carving, consisting of rocailles, shells, wing motifs, C-scrolls, and floral garlands. This decoration is highly asymmetrical on the chair’s side rails and is thus an expression of the pure Rococo style. The chair is upholstered à châssis, with a drop-in seat and removable back and arm pads, to which the original crimson velvet is tacked underneath, accommodating a seasonal change of upholstery. The scalloped edge of the gold trim echoes the serpentine outline of the chair’s frame. An armchair belonging to the same set is shown in the Museum’s full-length portrait of Louise-Élisabeth’s daughter Maria Luisa of Parma (1751 – 1819), later queen of Spain (26.260.9).Footnotes1.

Large-scale figurative tapestries like this one had been woven in Saint Petersburg since at least 1716 when Peter the Great founded a tapestry weaving workshop under royal protection; by 1756, its weavers were directed by Jean Baptiste Rondet, who had worked at the great Manufacture Royale des Gobelins in Paris. This tapestry, woven during the reign of Empress Catherine II of Russia, was probably entirely the work of Russian weavers, and is part of a large group of technically proficient tapestries modelled after great paintings in the Russian royal collection.",'animal_fibre'
"The Museum's set of six armchairs and two settees from the Tapestry Room at Croome Court, Worcestershire, formerly the seat of the earls of Coventry, is among the best documented of all English Neoclassical furniture.¹ It was executed by the leading London cabinetmakers, John Mayhew and William Ince² who in 1769 billed the owner of Croome, George William, the sixth earl (1721-1809), for ""6 Large Antique Elbow Chairs, with oval Backs, Carv'd with Double husks & ribbon, knot on top, Gilt in the Best Burnish'd Gold, Stuff'd with Besthair, in Linen, Backt with Fine Crimson Tammy, proper for Covering with Tapistry in the Country, the patterns included. 2 Settees for Each Side the Chimney, richly Carv'd & Gilt, Stuff'd & Cover'd to match the chairs. 10 Setts of Castors, with Screws, & fixing to the Chairs & Sofas.""³ The floral cartoons for the furniture covers were executed from 1760 to 1767 at the Gobelins Manufactory in Paris by Maurice Jacques (1712-1784) and the decorative artist Louis Tessier (1719/20-1781).  In England this was the first instance in which seat covers were designed en suite with a set of tapestry hangings, which were intended to be used rather like wallpaper, covering the walls from chair rail to cornice. The tapestries had a series of trompe l'oeil medallions with scenes designed by François Boucher (1703-1770) representing allegories of the elements: Air, Earth, Fire, and Water. The tapestries were finally installed in June 1771 by Mayhew and Ince: ""Three Men's time at Croome putting up the Tapestry."" This was the first of several sets of this group of tapestries, called the Tentures de Boucher, woven at the Gobelins for English houses, of which the best known are the ones made for Osterley Park, Middle-sex; Newby Hall, North Yorkshire; Weston Park, Shropshire; and Moor Park, Hertfordshire (now at Aske, North Yorkshire). Between 1902 and 1904 the ninth earl of Coventry sold the tapestries and tapestry-covered furniture and recovered the walls with green damask. Subsequently the original seat covers were acquired by a dealer in Paris, who removed and applied them to a set of modern frames in the Louis XV style. The Tapestry Room from Croome Court was given to the Metropolitan Museum by the Samuel H. Kress Foundation in 1958, together with the modern set of frames. In the following year the original frames were discovered in a warehouse in Paris. They were purchased by the Kress Foundation and shipped to the Museum, where they were refitted with their original tapestry covers.[William Rieder, adapted from European Furniture in The Metropolitan Museum of Art – Highlights of the Collection/ Daniëlle O.

"This object is from the collection of Natalia de Shabelsky (1841-1905), a Russian noblewoman compelled to preserve what she perceived as the vanishing folk art traditions of her native country. Traveling extensively throughout Great Russia, she collected many fine examples of textile art of the wealthy peasant class. From the 1870s until moving to France in 1902, Shabelsky amassed a large collection of intricately embroidered hand-woven household textiles and opulent festival garments with rich decoration and elaborate motifs. The Brooklyn Museum holdings include many fine examples including the majority of the garments. Portions of Shabelsky's collection are also housed at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, the Cleveland Art Museum, and the Russian Museum of Ethnography in St. Petersburg.In Russian culture the Sirin, Alkonost, and Gamayun are mythical birds with the head and often breast of women. The Sirin, based on the Siren of Greek mythology, sings songs of the heavens, but leads mortal men to their death. The siren is often a metaphor for temptation of the weak. The Alkonost and Gamayun are not considered evil as the Sirin. They deliver prophecies to mortals and represent God's will in religious belief. The tree of life motif in this piece is an excellent example of how the tree of life and goddess merged into one form. In this example the motif could be viewed as both the goddess in the birth position and as a flowering plant with symmetrical branches.",'animal_fibre'
"Working an embroidered maps such as this sampler became part of a young girl’s education, starting in the 1770s, and continuing until about the 1840s. The map of England and Wales was so popular that printed versions were available to be stitched, which slightly reduces the potential for learning geography, while retaining the importance of practicing neat embroidery. This example that had the name and the maker written on the frame, is quite late. But the polychrome embroidery on a fine wool foundation has survived in relatively good condition compared to some examples that were made on more fragile silk satin foundations. The addition of colored borders in the counties aids in distinguishing one place from another. Other embroidered maps of geographical features were produced, from individual towns and counties, to the entire world in two hemispheres.",'animal_fibre'
"These tapestry panels are part of a set of twelve armchairs and two settees ordered in Paris in 1753 by Baron Johann Ernst Bernstorff, Danish ambassador to the court of Versailles between 1744 and 1751. After returning to Denmark, Bernstorff commissioned this seat furniture for the tapestry room of his new residence in Copenhagen that was hung with four wall tapestries of the Amours des Dieux series woven at the Beauvais Manufactory. The tapestry covers are woven with animal and bird subjects after designs by the painter Jean-Baptiste Oudry (1686–1755). For a fuller description of the entire set, see, e.g., MMA 35.145.1.",'animal_fibre'
"Part of a larger set, this remarkable corner settee and its pair, also in the Museum, were commissioned by one of the most powerful figures in eighteenth-century Franconia, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim (1708–1779). Prince-bishop of Würzburg and, after 1757, also of Bamberg, Seinsheim divided his time between two official residences in those cities and his three summer castles, Veitschöchheim, Werneck, and Seehof.[1] Preferring the country to the city, Seinsheim spent about three months a year outside Bamberg, at Seehof, where he enjoyed walking and hunting. He was fond of gardens and did much to embellish the late-seventeenth-century castle and especially its park, where he ordered that a maze, a theater, and a cascade with grotto and trelliswork arcades be constructed.In 1761 he also resumed work on one of the ancillary buildings at Seehof, the Franckenstein Schlösschen. This garden pavilion at the east end of the orangery and greenhouses had been conceived as a place where the prince could retreat from the strict etiquette at his court. Built by the architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel (1703–1769) for one of Seinsheim's predecessors, Johann Philipp Anton von Franckenstein, prince-bishop from 1746 to 1753, the Schlösschen had been left unfinished at the time of Franckenstein's death. Contemporary records indicate that Seinsheim decided to have its two main rooms, the Saal and the Audience Chamber (also called the Arbor Room, or berceau), embellished with frescoes and stuccowork. All four walls of the Audience Chamber were to be decorated as an illusionary arbor with trelliswork and floral festoons. Franz Anton Ermeltraut, court painter at Würzburg, was commissioned to execute a small trompe l'oeil ceiling fresco. It is not known when this was finished because the work was delayed by occasional disputes between the patron and the painter and the latter's frequent illnesses.[2] No description of the room's interior was made when the Franckenstein Pavilion was demolished in the nineteenth century, but a drawing thought to be Ermeltraut's design for the Arbor Room has been preserved, illustrating its intended decoration.[3] Also, an inventory of 1774 at Schloss Seehof mentions a ""Grünes Perceau-zimmer,"" or Green Trelliswork Room, in the garden pavilion, showing that the room had been completed by then as planned.Among the furnishings listed were the two settees, together with a pair of matching armchairs and four side chairs that are also in the Museum's collection.[5] In addition, there were four wall brackets hanging in niches, two of which have been preserved as well.[6] These furnishings were described as ""von bildhauer Arbeith grün Lassirt,"" or carved and glazed green.Both the settees and the matching chairs have serpentine gilded frames consisting of large scrolls of various shapes and openwork aprons decorated with polychrome flowers and foliage. They are supported on slightly curved legs carved with a pattern of reeds, and rest on bun feet that are partly covered by foliage. Most unusual is the off-white studded latticework intertwined with gilded and painted foliage on the inner backs of the seats; this must have been in total harmony with the original setting of the furniture. The outer backs of the settees and armchairs were left unfinished, as they were intended to stand against the wall; the side chairs, however, have latticework carving on both sides and were meant to be seen in the round. Corresponding to the inventory description of 1774, traces of a green glaze, originally applied over the gilding, are still present on the furniture.[7] Subsequent inventories offer additional details about the pieces, mentioning their green silk-velvet seat cushions and their placement.[8] Being rather top-heavy and unsteady, the settees stood in two corners of the room and the armchairs are described as being fastened in the other two. Grooves in the outer backs of the settees seem to imply that they too were once secured to the walls of the room.It is, unfortunately, not known who was the maker of this unique garden-room furniture so expressive of the exuberant Rococo taste. Its sculptural silhouette and elaborate carving, the choice of linden wood, and the unusual construction and simple joinery all make it seem likely that a sculptor or master carver rather than a cabinetmaker was responsible for the set.[9] It has been suggested that Margravine Sophie Caroline von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1737–1817), of neighboring Bayreuth, presented the suite to Seinsheim.[10] This would explain the absence of bills in Seehof's archival records. The margravine is known to have visited Seinsheim regularly, and pieces of furniture were occasionally exchanged between them. Also in favor of a Bayreuth provenance is the florid style of the pieces: Rococo furniture of Bayreuth was characterized by unrestricted use of naturalistic motifs, such as flowers, foliage, reeds, and birds. There was also a preference in Bayreuth for naturalism in interiors. Several rooms in the more recent of Bayreuth's two castles, the Neues Schloss, were decorated before 1760 in imitation of latticework pavilions, the first examples of their kind in Germany.[11] A complete set of furniture would have been an unusually large gift, however. Since the Museum's suite was in such perfect harmony with its original setting, and given Seinsheim's attention to the smallest details of Seehof's embellishments, it seems more likely that the prince-bishop ordered it himself. With the exception of a corner settee in the Würzburg Residenz, no other pieces known today bear even the slightest resemblance to the Seehof set.[12] For this reason, and in the absence of contemporary documents, it is impossible to attribute the furniture to a specific artist.The settees, chairs, and wall brackets presumably remained in the Franckenstein Pavilion until it was pulled down, between 1867 and 1870, and were then transferred to the castle itself. Seehof, which was in the possession of the bishopric and then part of the Bavarian royal domain until 1842, had become the private property of Freiherr Friedrich von Zandt and his descendants. Photographs taken at the turn of the century and later show the furniture in the Zandt family dining room.[13] They indicate that large carved flowers, now missing, originally adorned the cresting of the frames. The castle survived World War II intact, but the interior furnishings were sold off after the death in 1951 of the last male heir of the Zandt family.[14] In 1956 the Munich antiques dealer Fischer-Böhler sold this exceptional seat furniture to the New York collector Emma A. Sheafer. At that time the chairs and settees were upholstered in eighteenth-century painted Chinese silk, and only the trelliswork carving on the outer backs of the side chairs was left uncovered. Mrs. Sheafer never knew the full splendor of the furniture that filled the dining room of her New York City apartment. It was with their painted silk show covers that the furniture came to the Museum as part of her bequest in 1973. Once the fabric had been taken off, a conservation campaign was undertaken. This included the reconstruction of the foliage around the inner edge of the frames, which had been cut away to accommodate the upholstery; the removal of later paint layers on the trelliswork; and the manufacture of seat cushions covered in velvet to match the originals.[15][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide 2006]Footnotes:[1] Much of the information in this entry is taken from Kisluk-Grosheide 1990.

They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, pp. 171–72.[8] See the inventories of 1802, room 57B, and 1817–18, p. 37, no. 2A, transcripts of which are kept in the archives at Schloss Seehof.[9] Linden wood was more often used for sculpture than for furniture during this period. Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, p. 169.[10] This was suggested by the Munich dealer Fischer-Böhler.[11] Kisluk-Grosheide 1990, pp. 156–57, fig. 23.[12] Heinrich Kreisel attributed the Würzburg settee to Johann Köhler, an otherwise unknown sculptor, who was paid for ""sculptural work [and/or] carving executed in the newly furnished chamber in the princely residence""; Kreisel 1930, pp. 29–30.

"This large rectangular textile with Chinese motifs and embroidery techniques is part of an important but little understood group of related works made in China for export.¹ Described by various scholars as hangings, covers, or coverlets, all the textiles in the group share a common layout with a central roundel in a rectangular field, surrounded by multiple borders. This type of composition is often associated with the influence of Portuguese and Spanish models, although there are some earlier Asian examples that employ this format as well.² Wholly Asian in subject and style, however, are the motifs. The pair of phoenixes at the center of the textile encircle a large peony. Similar dynamically posed birds are also seen in an architectural stone relief excavated from the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) capital and now in the National Museum of China, Beijing, as well as in a corresponding textile in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum,³ and peonies often figure in Ming rank badges, in which a pair of birds encircle a flower. Within the rectangular field are flowers and four more birds -- two golden pheasants and two peacocks, which were used as insignia for the second and third civil ranks in both Ming and Qing China. The multiple borders surrounding the central field include a wide border embroidered with various animals—rare creatures such as a tiger and elephant in addition to the familiar horse, deer, and goat, all of which are depicted side by side with such distinctively mythical Chinese beasts as a blue qilin and a white, singlehorned xiezhi. A composite animal with hooves and usually a single horn, the qilin is mentioned in poetry as early as the Han dynasty (206 b.c.–a.d. 220),⁴ its appearance was sometimes said to signal the birth of a sage, and it was used as a rank insignia for nobles. The xiezhi also appears in Han dynasty texts; known for its ability to distinguish virtue from evil, it used its sharp teeth and single horn to bite and gore wrongdoers, and it was the insignia for the censorate, which included judges. Here, both animals have flames shooting off their bodies, indicating their supernatural powers. Embroideries of this type were made for export, and a number have been preserved in Japan and Europe in historical contexts. The oldest documented example is an altar cloth in Saikyo￣ ji, a temple in Kyoto; it was donated in 1616.⁵ Another example, now in the Museo Diocesano, Chiavari, Italy, was donated to a church in Chiavari in 1651 and used as a baldachin, or canopy, for the clergy.⁶  Others are preserved in museum collections.⁷Chinese textiles and other goods came to the Americas via the Manila galleons’ annual trips between Acapulco (and Callao, the port city of Lima) and the Philippines. While to date no preserved embroideries from this group have been found in Mexico or Peru, their influence was present there by the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century,⁸ as evident in the similar layout and motifs of a Peruvian tapestry in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 33).⁹[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1.

"Tapestry-woven upholstery for two settees and twelve armchairs was commissioned at the same time as the wall hangings depicting the Four Continents (1978.404.1–.4).¹ The Four Continents was one of two suites・each including four wall tapestries and coordinating seating furniture・that were ordered from Beauvais in 1786; the subject of the other suite was to be a series illustrating the arts, sciences, agriculture, and commerce. An earlier suite of tapestry furniture covers depicting the continents was produced at the Royal Manufactory of Gobelins in 1748, and the arrangement of the motifs in Le Barbier’s covers is similar: personifications of the continents are set against a landscape on the seat backs, and native animals populate the seat covers.² This subject in tapestry aligns with the contemporary popularity of the Four Continents in eighteenth-century European art: everything from porcelain table decorations and tablewares to dinner napkins and ceiling frescoes incorporated personifications of the continents (see MMA 64.101.1347, 1348). The settee showing America and Europe emphasizes the close relationship between France and the new United States, which France promoted so forcefully in the tapestry depicting America. The figure of France occupies the center of the sofa back, and America is seated off to the left. In this composition, France is ‘introducing the new nation to Europe across Neptune’s domain, the Atlantic; France’s discarded armor lies at her feet, as the war has been won, and Victory crowns her.’³ The armchairs repeat the female personifications of each continent, attended by male figures and some of the fauna typically associated with each. There are three variations on each of the four continents, and, although they are all slightly different, the iconographic program is consistent. It appears that this upholstery was not affixed to furniture frames until sometime after 1852, decades after its production.⁴ Usually, a client commissioned or purchased high-quality tapestry upholstery before furniture frames were made to accommodate the weavings. This type of upholstery was quite popular in the late eighteenth century, and the Beauvais manufactory made many such sets.⁵ However, the combination of matching wall hangings and seating furniture was more unusual, and clearly more expensive. A suite of furnishings would have been reserved for a formal room, such as a salon or drawing room.

"This is the second in a set of four tapestries illustrating the life of a man as divided into twelve periods of six years. Ceres, in the center, stands for the summertime of life; the symbols and occupations of three months, April, May, and June, represent the years from ages 18 to 36. Ceres, Roman goddess of the harvest, is identified in a Latin elegiac distich on a scroll. The pansies and daisies of Ceres’s dress are not traditionally her flowers, and it has been suggested that they may refer here to the possible patron of this tapestry series, Margaret of Austria, Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1507 until 1530. The green bird conspicuous in the composition might also have been intended as a reference to Margaret of Austria, who apparently owned a green parrot.Each of the three vertical sections includes a roundel at the top surrounded by twenty-four hourglasses on a ground that is light above and dark below, in varied proportions, according to the seasons. Each roundel contains a sign of the zodiac, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer, and figures variously symbolizing April, May and June. The roundels are seen against the sky, which is dark blue at the top, and are flanked by winds, most with their names inscribed on their bellows or elsewhere. Below the two outer roundels are representations of the months’ occupations: gardening for April and sheep-shearing for June. Below the occupations and the center roundels are episodes from mythology and classical history illustrating protagonists associated with particular ages of a man. Under April is the sleeping youth Hercules, proving his new-found maturity by choosing Minerva and Discipline over Venus and Vice. Under May, Venus and Adonis dally. Under June, the soldier being presented with arms is identified in his banderol as ""Curius"", probably indicating Marcus Curius Dentatus, who was prized for refusing brides from the Samnite ambassadors, represented by the alluring maidens surrounding him. Given that he seems to be accepting the weaponry, an alternative identification sometimes suggested is that this is the triumphant young soldier Lucius Sicinius Dentatus whom, Pliny writes, was presented with arms in recognition of his bravery.The two outer episodes have framed pairs of verses in Latin, supported by pedestals, between them and the occupation of the month above; the center episode has a similar inscription between it and the deity below. The verses refer to the story illustrated. In the upper border, on scrolls held by winged boys, are three Latin couplets connecting each month with an age in the life of a man. In the lower border, flanking the inscription below the deity, are two medallions containing an animal, bird or object. The foregrounds of all the scenes are filled with flowering and fruiting plants.",'animal_fibre'
"This elaborate quarto-size bookbinding is the work of a professional embroiderer and contains a rich variety of materials applied with a series of complex and imaginative techniques. The composition of the cover and matching back is dominated by a central royal blazon of the Stuart monarchy quartered with the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The arms are surmounted by the royal crown and supported by a lion and unicorn engaging the shield with the Order of the Garter with its motto: ""Honi Soit Qvi Mal Y Pense"" in silver filé. The royal arms are surrounded by a voluted cartouche accentuated by fronds of tightly packed silver purl, couched down closely onto the green satin ground and headed by a scroll with the inscription ""Gloria Deo."" Flanking this central cartouche are two unidentified badges bearing a crossed silver key and what appears to be a staff, each within a wreath of satin-stitch laurel leaves and silver bells. Beneath and above these is a finely worked voluted interlace of couched silver cording, from which all the foliage, flowers, and heavily fruit-laden festoons hang in thick profusion.The front cover’s degraded condition helps to identify the array of techniques. A surviving coil of couched silver purls on the lower right volute beneath the royal arms suggests that the entire interlace was once filled with such couched silver purls. This is confirmed by the remnants of stitch holes that once held them to the satin surface. In addition, some missing leaves on the festoon reveal how several detached buttonhole leaves were raised by small tufts of wool felt, still present in the spaces of the festoon’s missing leaves. The various fruits are made vivid by a mixture of pink, blue, red, and yellow silk threads blended expertly in long-and-short-stitch silk thread over padding that follows closely the shape of the gourds, apples or peaches, and pomegranates. The grapes are rendered in a variety of stitches, including couched silver purl in the form of grape clusters loosely stitched over with yellow and pink silk floss. The effect is a silvery pink-yellow variegation that mimics the frosty skin of actual grapes. Ink marks of the original design are still visible in places.The royal coat of arms had been associated with the English Bible since the break with Rome in 1534, when Henry VIII proclaimed himself the ""Supreme Head on Earth"" of the Church of England. Thereafter, the royal coat of arms became emblematic not just of the king’s temporal authority, but his spiritual authority as well. The Tudor, and later the Stuart arms, would be emblazoned over the printed Bible and other investitures of ceremony of the English church, examples of which can be found in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The cover encloses three books bound together: the Geneva version of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer, printed in 1612 and 1616, respectively, by the London printer Robert Barker, as well as a Book of Psalms, printed by the Company of Stationers in London in 1624, a date that provides a terminus post quem for the binding. As David McKitterick notes, it was not uncommon for such works to be bound together in the seventeenth century, even texts of varied dates such as these. The richness of the cover suggests a ceremonial use. The prominent imprese on the cover, possibly relating to insignias of office, may also imply a more official usage. Yvonne Hackenbroch reported a ""tradition"" (though without supporting documentation) that this volume had been a gift from King James I to Sir Edward Denny, later 1st Earl of Norwich. Although in 1870 Isaac d’Israeli recorded an 18th-century report of a gift of gloves from King James I to Denny, this provenance cannot be confirmed from the imprese, which show no likeness to Edward Denny’s coat of arms and have yet to be identified. It may also be reasonably supposed that James would confer as gifts copies of his own Authorized Version of the Bible, in print since 1611, rather than the older Geneva version, as here. A surviving Master’s Crown of the Broderer’s Company, dated to the second half of the sixteenth century and illustrated in George Wingfield-Digby’s Elizabethan Embroidery (1964), is very similar in design and technique to this Bible cover. As such, the comparison brings the latter into association with an unquestionable piece of professional work of the very highest quality and shows the persistence of style and technique into the seventeenth century.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'
"Commissioned by Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, a great-nephew of Pope Alexander VIII, this was part of a massive series, heroic in scale as well as narrative, of fifteen tapestries depicting the romanticized version of the Christians’ First Crusade into Jerusalem recounted in Tasso’s sixteenth-century epic poem, Gerusalemme Liberata (Jerusalem Delivered). In a gentle illusionistic interplay of spatial projection and recession, double-headed eagles (alluding to the Ottoboni arms), settle on the imposing sculptural surround to a landscape scene in which the Turkish princess, Erminia, fleeing from Christian soldiers, seeks shelter with a shepherd and his family.",'animal_fibre'
"The complicated figural composition and the color combination of red and yellow, as well as the choice of materials and technique, relate this fabric to earlier traditions in Florentine weaving. In this example, disparate decorative motifs, arranged in a fluid, nearly narrative manner, have a convincing coexistence despite their symmetrical arrangement: dolphins' tails merge into a cartouche that in turn forms the support for an elaborate vase, which is simultaneously a container for a variety of flowers, in whose leaves nest two birds, and a ledge for two winged figures that confront the amorini, bows and arrows at their feet, below. That this particular composition, with motif variations, is also known in different color schemes and fabric types attests to its popularity as a design for a number of furnishing uses.",'animal_fibre'

"Band samplers are composed of horizontal rows (""bands"") of embroidered patterns stitched along the linen foundation fabric. Many of the patterns stitched onto band samplers can be traced to sixteenth-century pattern books, and often include depictions of fruit, flowers, and geometric patterns. The sampler includes bands of floral and geometric patterns, in addition to a band that includes ""boxers,"" male figures who flank a floral motif and hold a ""trophy,"" in this case a flower. The figure of the boxer is derived from the motif of a lover offering a flower to his beloved, which is found in a number of sixteenth-century pattern books.Included on the sampler is the name Esther French and the year 1684, presumably the name of the maker and the year in which she completed her work. She may have been Esther French (sometimes written as ""Hester"") of Warminster, Wiltshire, England, who was born on November 25, 1670. This would make her thirteen or fourteen years old when she completed her sampler. Esther was born into a family of clothiers (professionals who make or sellcloth) and married into the Wansey family, another family of clothiers in Warminster.",'animal_fibre'

"Cyrillic script on a fictive plaque adorning a trompe l’oeil frame identifies “Rembrandt”, the artist of the painting this tapestry imitates. Large-scale figurative tapestries like this one had been woven in Saint Petersburg since at least 1716 when Peter the Great founded a tapestry weaving workshop under royal protection; by 1756, its weavers were directed by Jean Baptiste Rondet, who had worked at the great Manufacture Royale des Gobelins in Paris. This tapestry, woven during the reign of Empress Catherine II of Russia, was probably entirely the work of Russian weavers, and is part of a large group of technically proficient tapestries modelled after great paintings in the Russian royal collection.",'animal_fibre'

Portraying scenes from classical myths symbolizing the elements, the medallions are based on designs by François Boucher. The set was delivered and in place by June 1771. The group was the first using this design to be woven with a crimson background and it may have been the first made specifically to extend around four walls of a room without architectural frames.",'animal_fibre'
"A shawl was a required fashion accessory during much of the nineteenth century. In the early 1800s long, rectangular, stolelike examples, hand-woven in India with boteh (pine cone) or paisley patterned end panels, were coveted for use with Empire-style dresses. This style was followed by the square shawl and then, with the introduction of wider skirts, by ""plaids""—a term used not to describe the pattern but to connote a very large and long shawl, usually ten feet by five feet.Stylistically, this shawl demonstrates both a ""four seasons"" layout—in which the ground color is different in each of the quadrants—and an organization a la pivot, indicating the manner in which the vegetation swirls around a central point. The design for the shawl is probably French, but it may have been purchased by a Scottish manufacturer and jacquard-woven in Paisley.[Alice Zrebiec, 1995]",'animal_fibre'

"Minerva, Roman goddess of art and science, stands as if on a stage in the center foreground of this composition, surrounded above and to the sides by curling plant tendrils, gamboling animals and putti, and elegant swags of drapery. In the cartouche above, Minerva receives offerings of a book and vessel. This is one of two surviving tapestries of Minerva from the thrice-woven series of tapestries called the Doria Grotesques. Perino del Vaga designed the eight-piece sequence in about 1545 for the naval commander Andrea Doria to add to the substantial tapestry collection in his glorious palazzo in Fassolo, then just outside the port city of Genoa. The Grotesques, each featuring a different deity, showcased Perino's dexterity in this decorative field, combining respect for antique prototypes with Raphael-inspired Renaissance grace. Though designed in Italy, the three sets of Grotesques tapestries, all made for Doria, were woven 500 miles away in the Southern Netherlands, almost certainly in Brussels, where the most celebrated weavers in the world worked. The Met also owns Neptune from this series (2011.14): the tapestries were apparently created in different workshops, their weaving styles being quite dissimilar.

"During his tenure as governor of the Dutch-controlled area of Brazil, Johan Maurits (1604–1679) commissioned two artists in his service to record the area’s wildlife and inhabitants. The resulting works were translated into tapestries for him by 1678; he found them so impressively lifelike that he wrote, ""it would be possible, by the tapestries, to see Brazil without crossing the ocean.""¹ In contrast, the first English tapestries depicting exotic and foreign scenes were inventive compilations of motifs from the Far East. John Vanderbank, weaver in London, is recorded as having supplied nine pieces in the ""Indian Manner"" for the decoration of Kensington Palace in the 1690s.² These tapestries are thought to have been of the same type as the present hanging, and if this theory is correct, they would have complemented the vast collection of Asian porcelain and Dutch Delft ceramics of Queen Mary II (1662–1694). A print by Daniel Marot the Elder suggests the appearance of such a collection juxtaposed with wall decoration of either Asian lacquer panels or some European imitation.³ The Toilet of the Princess is one of two Indo-Chinese tapestry scenes in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection. As many as fifty variations on these compositions of exotic characters on little islands floating on plain backgrounds were made in England, attesting to their popularity.⁴ These tapestries were made in sets of varying dimensions and numbers of panels, depending on the room for which they were intended. Placing scattered vignettes against a dark background was a concept clearly inspired by the lacquer panels that were being imported to Europe from Japan and China. The diarist John Evelyn mentioned seeing an inventive use of lacquer panels in 1682, writing, ""in the hall are contrivences of Japan Skreens, instead of wainscot; . . . The landskips of the skreens represent the manner of living, and country of the Chinese.""⁵ Individual motifs and groupings on the tapestries are an imaginative combination of Chinese and Indian scenes that derived from a variety of sources, including illustrations from the works of such European travelers and artists as the Danish Melchior Lorck (1526–after 1588) and the Dutch Arnold Montanus (1625?–1683).⁶ The designer of the tapestries attributed to Vanderbank has not been discovered. The original owner of this tapestry is not known. However, Elihu Yale (1649–1721) had four tapestries in this style, two with designs very close to those in the Metropolitan Museum.⁷ Yale was born in Boston, but his family moved back to England when he was a child. He served the East India Company from 1670 to 1692 and remained in Madras, India, until 1699, looking after his lucrative personal business interests there. Yale was governor of Fort St. George in Madras from 1687 to 1692. According to an English visitor to Madras in 1675, the English governors lived in great splendor with numerous attendants, thus Yale may have been attracted to these charming tapestries as a reminder of his lifestyle during his tenure in India.⁸ Though he never returned to North America, Elihu Yale agreed to support a newly established college in New Haven by sending 417 books as well as bales of cloth to be sold, which brought in 562 British pounds.⁹ The founders were so grateful for this windfall that in 1718 they renamed the school Yale College.

"This band sampler by Margret Barber, probably worked between 1661 and 1663, is divided into rows within three larger sections, each of which showcases a specific technique. The top two-thirds of the sampler includes motifs easily classifiable into standard categories, such as alphabetic characters, geometric designs, and floral motifs, worked in silk and linen on a linen ground using several common stitch techniques. An embroidered alphabet marks the end of the top third of the piece. The middle third is worked with white thread on a white ground, a technique commonly known as whitework. This middle section features scattered design motifs and concludes with an embroidered rendering of the maker’s name and dates of production.The bottom third of the piece is worked in reticella, a technique that originated in the late fifteenth century. The technique developed from cutwork and utilized stitches common to embroidery. Threads were pulled from a plain weave linen fabric to create open spaces in which a design was completed and the deconstructed fabric was stabilized primarily with buttonhole stitches. The result is a design based on the grid of the foundation fabric, with open areas throughout and arched and scalloped borders. Subsequently, the technique progressed to the point where the foundation fabric was eliminated and the design was worked over threads temporarily secured to a piece of vellum or paper for stability during the construction of what was called punto in aria (literally, ""stitches in air""), or early needle lace.Designs for reticella were popularized through numerous editions of late sixteenth-century Continental pattern books. Copies of these books made their way into England, and their popularity occasioned the publication of English pattern books, mostly consisting of patterns copied from the earlier book.Although cutwork and needle-lace techniques continued to be popular, especially for fashionable accessories, through the 1630s, there are very few examples of these techniques that have been attributed to English manufacture, despite the number of English samplers that confirm these skills were taught. The finest lace was imported, although the cost was certainly prohibitive for all but the elite. Therefore, the cultivation of practical skill in whitework and lace techniques would enable the maker to produce all manner of trimming necessary to fashionable attire. This sampler was purchased by London’s Royal School of Needlework in 1916; and it is quite possible that it continued to fulfill its seventeenth-century function of being an exemplar for early twentieth-century students.Samplers containing whitework, cutwork, and needle lace were attempted after basic skills were already mastered, if the case of Martha Edlin can be considered typical. She created her polychrome band sampler first and then move on to the more challenging whitework and cutwork embroidery. Women’s training in this standard progression of technical skills was an extraordinarily important part of a seventeenth-century education, particularly for daughters of the upper class and gentry. According to the household accounts of the Verney family, at least two hours each day were set aside for the practice of embroidery under the instruction of a tutor. It was decided that Sir Ralph Verney’s eight-year-old daughter, ""being a girl she shall not learn Latin, so she will have more time to learn breeding [manners] hereafter and needlework too."" Training in embroidery not only prepared a girl in practical necessities, but it also held a moral dimension. Richard Braithwaite in his 1631 text The English Gentlewoman noted that textile production should be considered ""arguments of [her] industry, memorials of [her] piety."" Women were educated in preparation for marriage, to run a household, and to be a good Christian. Verses from the Bible were often read aloud as women performed household sewing and embroidery, instilling the very activity of working with a needle with pious associations.The use of all three embroidery types—colored, whitework, and lace techniques—on a band sampler is relatively rare compared with simpler combinations of colored bands and whitework. As previously noted, it is uncertain how much actual needle-lace trimming was produced in England during the mid-seventeenth century, but there is a relatively large number of surviving whitework samplers dated to the 1640s. Particularly notable are examples that include figural compositions with detached elements.[Emily Zilber, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'
"The settees and chairs illustrated here (see 1974.356.114–.121) were made for the Franckenstein Pavilion in the gardens of Seehof Castle near Bamberg, one of the three summer residences in Southern Germany used by Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim, prince bishop of Würzberg and Bamberg. A true garden enthusiast, it was under von Seinsheim that the gardens of Seehof were embellished, which must have resembled the still extant Rococo gardens completed by von Seinsheim at Veitshöchheim. His love for gardens and garden imagery also carried over into the interior decoration and furnishings of his castles, as the Seehof furniture demonstrates. A unique example of German Rococo furniture executed in a more flamboyant style than its French prototypes, the ensemble was designed specifically for the Garden Room in the Franckenstein Pavilion. Used as an audience room, it was referred to as the ""Green Trellis Chamber"" in the 1774 Seehof inventory and painted entirely with trompe l'oeil trellis and foliage. The garden room's furniture was made to match: the backs of the chairs and settees are richly carved in the form of garden trellis-work with colored flowers and foliage.",'animal_fibre'
"As its full-size domed canopy is suspended from the ceiling rather than supported on posts, this tester bed, which bears the stamp of the menuisier Georges Jacob, is a type called lit à la duchesse en impériale. Its original but now fragile hangings, woven in 1782–83 at the Beauvais tapestry manufactory after designs by Jean-Baptiste Huet (1745–1811), have been replaced by modern silk damask, except for the lining of the interior dome. French eighteenth-century beds tended to be lofty, as it was customary to pile them with three or more mattresses filled with straw, wool, horsehair, or feathers. Tobias Smollett (1721–1771) noted in 1766, “French beds are so high, that sometimes one is obliged to mount them by the help of steps.”[1]The custom of receiving visitors while reposing in a large and elegantly fitted out bed was practiced in France during the eighteenth century mostly by aristocratic women. The Museum’s imposing piece of furniture with its exquisitely carved floral decoration, the work of an unknown carver, must have formed a splendid backdrop for such official calls or congratulatory visits. In 1791 the bed is documented as standing in the large bedchamber of Guyonne-Marguerite de Durfort de Lorge, duchesse de Choiseul-Praslin (1737–1806), at her Parisian home, the Hôtel de Belle Isle. Following the turmoil of the Revolution and the political changes of the early nineteenth century, the bed was sold in Paris in 1830. It became part of the famous collections at Hamilton Palace, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the residence of Alexander Hamilton Douglas, tenth Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852), where it was placed in one of the state rooms. The duke’s grandson sold the contents of the palace, including the bed, at a highly anticipated auction that took place in 1882. Through the intermediation of several dealers, the bed was acquired in 1897 by the financier and railroad executive George J. Gould (1864–1923). His wife, the former actress Edith M. Kingdon (1864–1921), used it in her bedroom of their New York town house.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010]Footnotes:[1] Tobias George Smollett. Travels through France and Italy. London, 1766.

"Attributed to the cabinetmaker Martin Carlin, who was known for his graceful furniture mounted with Sevres porcelain, this exquisite two-piece desk was made about 1776. A date letter for that year is painted on the back of the central porcelain plaque, together with the mark of Edme-Francois Bouillat (1739/40–1810), a painter at the Sevres manufactory. A specialist in different kinds of floral ornament, Bouillat decorated the main plaque with a flower basket suspended from a large bowknot. The history of this secretary is well documented. During the eighteenth century it graced the collections of two remarkably different women. Its first owner was the popular soprano Marie-Josephine Laguerre (1755–1783), who as a fille d'Opera enjoyed a luxurious and dissolute existence made possible by her wealthy lovers. Her personal property was publicly sold in April 1782, less than a year before her untimely death. The catalogue indicates that she owned this secretary as well as two other pieces of furniture embellished with porcelain plaques. Some of the Sevres decorative wares in her collection may have been displayed on the marble shelves of the secretary. It is likely that Dominique Daguerre, who with his partner, Simon-Philippe Poirier, had a virtual monopoly on the purchase of Sèvres plaques, supplied the piece of furniture to Laguerre and bought it back at the 1782 sale, but this is not documented. In May of that same year, Maria Feodorovna, grand duchess of Russia, and her husband, Paul (1754–1801), visited Paris incognito as the comte and comtesse du Nord. The future empress was described by Jeanne-Louise-Henriette Campan (1752–1822), first lady-in-waiting to Marie-Antoinette, as being “of a fine height, very fat for her age, with all the stiffness of the German demeanour.”[1] In Paris, Maria Feodorovna frequented the shops of the fashionable dealers, where she is likely to have acquired the porcelain-mounted secretary and other furnishings for her country residence at Pavlovsk.According to a detailed description of her private rooms written in 1795 by Maria Feodorovna herself, the secretary was placed in her boudoir.[2] It remained at the imperial palace until the Soviet government, which had taken possession of Pavlovsk after the Revolution of 1917, offered works of art for sale to the dealer Joseph Duveen (1869–1939), who had traveled to the Soviet Union in 1931.[1] Campan 1823, vol. 1, p. 237.[2] Feodorovna 1795/1903, p. 374.",'animal_fibre'

While designs for this embroidered bedcover and the related valance have not been located, the attribution to May Morris is based in its similarity to several of her known works from the 1890s.

"The term ""bizarre silk"" was popularized with the publication of Vilhelm Slomann’s Bizarre Designs in Silks (1953). Slomann’s theory that these woven silks were designed, and is some cases produced, in India was quickly refuted, but the term has stuck.¹ The precise origin for this distinctive style of silk produced in Europe between about 1690 and 1720 has not been established; a number of cultures clearly contributed to the creation of these patterns. Certain relationships have been drawn: for example, an integration of Japanese design concepts such as the abstraction of motifs and a discrepancy of scale has been suggested as a primary influence.² In this panel the influence of Ottoman sixteenth- and seventeenth-century design is apparent in the meandering pattern and the layering of motifs, as well as in their large scale. Like many European bizarre silks, the motifs in this panel have become so stylized that they defy identification. The high quality of this particular example and others of the type suggests that these textiles were made in well-established European weaving centers, such as Lyon or Tours in France, in Venice, or in other Italian or Spanish textile-producing cities. A small number of them have been associated with the Spitalfields weaving center (now in the East End of London) on the basis of the extant design drawings by several early eighteenth-century English designers.³ The Dutch are known to have had a significant silk-weaving industry as well (see MMA 1976.12), and some Dutch examples of bizarre silk from the early eighteenth century have been identified.⁴ There are few complete garments surviving from the turn of the eighteenth century, but a rare unaltered bizarre silk mantua is at the Metropolitan Museum (see MMA 1991.6.1a,b). Mantuas of this period were relatively unstructured women’s gowns that took most of their shape from draping and pinning on the body. The expanse of fabric from the shoulder to the train created an ideal showcase for such luxurious textiles with large patterns.Very few bizarre silks seem to have been used for interior decoration, though vegetal motifs similar to those seen on the dress silks found their way to embroidered furnishings (see MMA 53.32.1a-d and 53.32.2a-d). 1.

"Commissioned by Louis XVI, this ensemble belongs to a set of four wall hangings (1978.404.1–.4) and fifty-six pieces of furniture upholstery (1978.404.5a–c–.18a–c) depicting the four continents: America, Europe, Asia, and Africa.",'animal_fibre'
"Tapestry-woven upholstery for two settees and twelve armchairs was commissioned at the same time as the wall hangings depicting the Four Continents (1978.404.1–.4).¹ The Four Continents was one of two suites・each including four wall tapestries and coordinating seating furniture・that were ordered from Beauvais in 1786; the subject of the other suite was to be a series illustrating the arts, sciences, agriculture, and commerce. An earlier suite of tapestry furniture covers depicting the continents was produced at the Royal Manufactory of Gobelins in 1748, and the arrangement of the motifs in Le Barbier’s covers is similar: personifications of the continents are set against a landscape on the seat backs, and native animals populate the seat covers.² This subject in tapestry aligns with the contemporary popularity of the Four Continents in eighteenth-century European art: everything from porcelain table decorations and tablewares to dinner napkins and ceiling frescoes incorporated personifications of the continents (see MMA 64.101.1347, 1348). The settee showing America and Europe emphasizes the close relationship between France and the new United States, which France promoted so forcefully in the tapestry depicting America. The figure of France occupies the center of the sofa back, and America is seated off to the left. In this composition, France is ‘introducing the new nation to Europe across Neptune’s domain, the Atlantic; France’s discarded armor lies at her feet, as the war has been won, and Victory crowns her.’³ The armchairs repeat the female personifications of each continent, attended by male figures and some of the fauna typically associated with each. There are three variations on each of the four continents, and, although they are all slightly different, the iconographic program is consistent. It appears that this upholstery was not affixed to furniture frames until sometime after 1852, decades after its production.⁴ Usually, a client commissioned or purchased high-quality tapestry upholstery before furniture frames were made to accommodate the weavings. This type of upholstery was quite popular in the late eighteenth century, and the Beauvais manufactory made many such sets.⁵ However, the combination of matching wall hangings and seating furniture was more unusual, and clearly more expensive. A suite of furnishings would have been reserved for a formal room, such as a salon or drawing room.

"This tapestry’s design belongs to the style of the “small-figure genre”, popularized towards the end of the century in part to compensate for vagaries of weaving execution threatened by the migration of weavers during the civil and religious unrest in the Habsburg Netherlands during these years.  Stylistically, Noble Retinue in a Landscape appears to be a later work and may prove to be a useful example of van Herzeele’s work after he had relocated to Antwerp for the last eight years of his life. Bearing in mind the Italian patrons of the Victorian and Albert Museum’s van Herzeele-woven five-part Landscape with the Arms of the Contarini family of Venice (127-130, a – 1869), as well as the Genovese patron, Andrea Doria, of the Doria Grotesques, and the inclusion of the arms of Cardinal Montalto (subsequently Pope Sixtus V) on the Story of the Sabines and the Romans, it is possible that, upon further investigation, Noble Retinue in a Landscape, with its Italianate border, might likewise have been an Italian commission.",'animal_fibre'

"While Lyons was the undisputed center of the silk-weaving industry during the eighteenth century, Genoa provided much of the high-quality velvet for both furnishings and fashion. A specialty was polychrome-velvet weaving, as in this fabric, which possibly was intended to be used for an elegant wide-skirted mantua, or gown. Although the pattern repeat of stylized and seminaturalistic flowers is relatively small, it appears more complex, as it is rendered with seven different colors, a feat of technical virtuosity. The individual motifs are further modeled by juxtaposing cut and uncut (""ciselé"") pile, which reflect light differently. This mutable effect is more dramatic when the fabric is in movement, as one's perception of the colors changes dramatically depending on whether the fabric is vertical or horizontal, flat or draped.",'animal_fibre'
"Sumptuous fabrics without any particular religious imagery were often used to make ecclesiastical vestments. This cope, in its original state, is composed of four full and two partial widths of a handsome red silk satin with an asymmetrical floral pattern, shown here in detail. The same fabric is used for the orphrey band, the morse, and the hood, which are, in addition to the cope as a whole, bordered in metallic lace. The hood is trimmed with an additional band of metallic lace and three bows of brocaded ribbon. The various floral and design elements of the main fabric, as well as the pattern organization in general, can be related to Italian textiles, particularly Venetian silks of the fifteenth century. The asymmetrical undulating composition and motifs of stylized blossoms, pomegranate buds with superimposed rosettes, and multilobed leaves with rounded edges are all inspired by the earlier fabrics. Also similar is the combination of solid-color ground with pattern in glowing metallic thread. The familiar motif of the opened pomegranate is borrowed from yet another group of Italian Renaissance silks and velvets. More specific to the eighteenth century is the device of ""threading"" together flowers and leaves of diverse types on one thin stem. This motif appears in the so-called bizarre silks, which are often thought to be of Italian manufacture and are contemporary with the cope.

"Peter Carl Fabergé (1846–1920) was a visionary and talented artisan and jeweler. In 1872 he took over his father's small jewelry atelier in Saint Petersburg and within forty years had transformed it into the world's largest enterprise of its kind, employing some five hundred craftsmen and designers. His methods encompassed streamlined production, fair pricing, and global marketing. The firm built a devoted clientele that included cabinet ministers and the newly rich and, above all, members of the Russian imperial family, the Romanov, for whom they made the most precious pieces and extraordinary Easter eggs.

"This type of glove, made of substantial leather with the hand and wrist gauntlet in one piece, may have been worn for practical protection by a person of means, despite the presence of silk and metallic thread embroidery, which to the modern eye would render the gloves impractical. Unlike other gloves of the time, which have separately constructed and highly decorated gauntlets that appear far too fragile to wear, this pair would have been relatively functional.These gloves were said to have belonged to James I, primarily because of the presence of the Scottish thistle in the embroidery, but there is no conclusive evidence of this connection. This attribution was first asserted by W. B. Redfern in 1904 and repeated by Frances Morris in 1929. As an insignia of royalty after James’s accession to the English throne, the thistle motif was usually combined with the Tudor rose to represent the union of England and Scotland under one ruler, as on an early seventeenth-century embroidered cushion cover with the royal arms surmounted by a large rose and two small stylized thistles, now held in the Victoria and Albert Museum.Beginning in the late sixteenth century, gloves play an increasingly visible role in portraiture, and their functions were practical as well as symbolic. This pair may be similar to the type of leather glove with metallic thread fringe described in the wardrobes of both sons of James I, as described in surviving inventories and bills for both princes’ wardrobes. Accounts from about 1608 for Henry, Prince of Wales, included ""four pair of staggs leather gloves, perfumed and fringed with gold and silver fringe, at 16s."" And his younger brother, Charles, when he was king, ordered similar gloves in even larger quantities during the 1630s: ""2 dozen pairs of thick stags lether gloues with gold and silver fringes.""

"The highly skilled maker who executed these gloves chose an intricate design—floral yet geometric—that alludes to the more simple versions found in early seventeenth century pattern books. As scholars have pointed out, pattern books for needlework and lacemaking, which were marketed towards women of the middling classes, presented an opportunity for upward mobility at a time when wealth was partially measured in fine possessions. The elite classes might hire artists and professionals to design and carry out, and thus distinguish their own embroidered goods. This pair of gloves features French knots, couching and raised work on purple satin in colored silk, silver and gilded silver thread, further ornamented with spangles and bobbin lace.

It became part of the famous collections at Hamilton Palace, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the residence of Alexander Hamilton Douglas, tenth Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852), where it was placed in one of the state rooms. The duke’s grandson sold the contents of the palace, including the bed, at a highly anticipated auction that took place in 1882. Through the intermediation of several dealers, the bed was acquired in 1897 by the financier and railroad executive George J. Gould (1864–1923). His wife, the former actress Edith M. Kingdon (1864–1921), used it in her bedroom of their New York town house.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010]Footnotes:[1] Tobias George Smollett. Travels through France and Italy. London, 1766.

"As one of the forerunners of modern design, Morris took much of his inspiration from the arts and crafts of the past. His disgust with the inferiority of many Victorian industrially made textiles, which he found lacking in both quality and appropriateness of design, led him to study the aesthetics and techniques of earlier historic examples-from tapestries to embroideries. This knowledge enabled him to take inspiration from the past while still creating for contemporary needs. Thus, a two-dimensional design such as ""Kennet"" could be—and was—successfully used for wallpaper, woven silks, and printed fabrics. The effect in each medium, however, was altered by choices in color combinations (bold or subtle), materials (shiny or matte), and textures (flat or pile). While the undulating flower stalks look back to Italian fifteenth- and sixteenth-century velvet designs, they also presage of Art Nouveau.",'vegetal_fibre'
"Like the Ages of Man tapestries (also on display in this gallery and perhaps designed in the same artist's workshop), the subject of this tapestry explores the cyclical nature of time. Embodying October, peasants sow the fields with seed in a crisp Autumnal landscape. Jupiter, seated on a plough, looks down the scene. A Zodiacal belt encloses this medallion, with Scorpio triumphant. Pairs of women with hourglasses separate the signs, whilst the background shifts from bright daylight through dusk to dark night, thence back through dawn to day. In the upper corners are SUPERNAS, actually a summer wind, and NOTUS, a south wind. In the lower corners are further charmingly-observed scenes of country life.",'animal_fibre'
"Czar Alexander presented this egg to his wife, Maria Feodorovna, on Easter 1890. The egg is extraordinary in its conception and technical virtuosity. It possesses one of the most sophisticated palettes of all the imperial Easter eggs. Divided into twelve sections in opalescent pink enamel, it opens on a hinge to reveal its surprise—a folding ten-panel gold screen in a crimson velvet pocket. Resting on Greek-key feet, the screen bears ten miniatures of the empress's favorite Danish and Russian retreats. A nostalgic reminder of her home country, the egg accompanied her on her travels.From left to right: imperial yacht Polar Star; Bernsdorff Palace, Copenhagen; Emperor Villa in Fredensborg Park, Hvidøre, Copenhagen; Fredensborg Palace, summer residence, Copenhagen; Amalienborg Palace, Copenhagen; Kronborg Castle, Elsinore; Cottage Palace, Alexandria Park, Peterhof; Cottage Palace, Alexandria Park, Peterhof (south main entrance); Catchina Palace, Saint Petersburg; imperial tacht Tsaverna.[Wolfram Koeppe, 2011]",'animal_fibre'
"This is the fourth in a set of four tapestries illustrating the life of a man as divided into twelve periods of six years. Aeolus, ruler of the winds, in the center, stands for the wintertime of life. The symbols and occupations of three months, October, November, and December, represent the years from ages 54 to 72, traditionally identified as the final three ages of a man, equated with old age, infirmity and death. Aeolus’s two attendants may be personifications of Snow and Frost. The owl symbolizes sleep and death.Each of the three vertical sections includes a roundel at the top surrounded by twenty-four hourglasses on a ground that is light above and dark below, in varied proportions, according to the seasons. Each roundel contains a sign of the zodiac, Scorpio, Sagittarius and Capricorn, and a figure variously symbolizing October, November or December. Flanking the roundels are embodiments of wintery winds, mostly with their names inscribed on their bellows or elsewhere, amongst them is Boreas, himself often the symbolic embodiment of winter. Beneath, as appropriate occupation of the month, pigs are fed under October and threshing and winnowing represent December (not, in fact, a usual activity for this month and probably included to allude to the accompanying inscription ""The Goat shakes the grain from the fallen ears""). Below are episodes from classical history and the Old Testament illustrating protagonists associated with particular ages of a man. For Old Age (54-60), the piety of the Byzantine Emperor Tiberius II is rewarded when he causes a paving stone inappropriately bearing the cross to be lifted and discovers treasure, which he distributes amongst the poor. For Infirmity (60-66), Tobias respectfully listens to the parting advice from his blind and infirm father, Tobit. For encroaching Death (66-72), Jacob blesses his grandsons Manasseh and Ephraim from his deathbed. Perhaps indicating the possible patron of this tapestry series, the empress in Tiberius’s scene has the facial features of Margaret of Austria, Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands; the man standing behind her repeats a figure representing Saint Gommaire in a stained-glass window (now in the Royal Museum of Art and History in Brussels) made for the chapel of the Fencers' Guild in Mechelen cathedral, probably a disguised portrait of a noble member of the guild and Margaret's court.The two outer episodes have framed pairs of verses in Latin, supported by pedestals, between them and the occupation of the month above; the center episode has a similar inscription between it and the deity below. The verses refer to the story illustrated. In the upper border, on scrolls held by winged boys, are three Latin couplets connecting each month with an age in the life of man. In the lower border, flanking the inscription below the deity, are two medallions containing an animal, bird or object. The foregrounds of all the scenes are filled with flowering and fruiting plants.",'animal_fibre'
"With the crucified Christ anchoring the composition, a host of angels fills a turbulent sky, holding the symbols of the Passion. Below, John the Evangelist strides in from the left; at the right, Mary Magdalene, richly-dressed fitting to the popular perception of her as a reformed courtesan, elegantly crumples forward with hand-wringing grief. Also weeping, the Virgin Mary gazes up at her son, and a third holy woman, possibly Mary of Cleophas, embraces the cross. The painterly detail of the tapestry’s design extends to the minutely observed background landscape, in which the bracketing episodes of the carrying of the cross and the entombment can be glimpsed flanking the central scene. To this the virtuoso tapestry-weavers, clearly at the pinnacle of their profession, have brought a material sumptuousness which would have glimmered in the candlelight and which serve to rank this tapestry amongst the richest survivals of the period.",'animal_fibre'
"The rich brown leather of these gloves is unusual; most surviving gloves from the seventeenth century are lighter in color. However, the motifs embroidered on the gauntlets—pea pods and blossoms—were quite common during the period. Pea pods were often associated with romantic love.

"This work is an example of a Marken Island sampler. Samplers from this area are characterized by bands of colorful patterns. Girls stitched these bands to practice patterns for ""vernaaide linten,"" ribbons that were attached to a cap and which were an important part of the costume tradition on Marken Island. These ribbons consisted of black embroidery on white linen. The women of Marken are said to have kept their samplers in or near their kitchens for handy reference, so much of the needlework appears darkened from residue from cooking fires. Samplers from this area, including this one, often include striped horses. Spot motifs, bands of geometric patterns, and bands of cutwork and whitework are also stitched. The letters L, S, P, I, M, and N, stitched individually, in pairs, and in groups in a seemingly random fashion on the bottom of the linen are perhaps the initials of the maker and her family members.",'animal_fibre'
"Raised work, or stumpwork as it is sometimes called, developed in England during the early seventeenth century, and was characterized by its high relief. The technique was used to create pictures and to decorate objects such as storage boxes for jewelry and writing supplies, baskets, and mirror frames. This box is typical of raised-work pieces in that it employs a variety of stitches and includes the use of metal thread and other materials, in addition to colored silks. The faces of the five women representing the Senses are drawn in ink on satin, and the figure of Sight holds a mirror made of mica that reflects her face. Other unexpected materials were frequently used to highlight details: real hair for a figure's head, tiny seed pearls for a necklace, and glass beads for animal eyes.Allegorical and biblical subjects, along with portraits of monarchs, were the most common themes for the decoration of a seventeenth-century box. Of the seven complete and partial boxes in the Museum's collection, the majority show biblical scenes, although these are sometimes combined with depictions of the Senses or the Seasons.Raised work had a rather short period of popularity and was at its peak during the mid-seventeenth century. The creation of raised-work boxes, mirror frames, and pictures ceased to be a fashionable occupation by the turn of the eighteenth century, if not sooner.",'animal_fibre'

"According to tradition, the unicorn cannot be disturbed while performing a magical act. The attack by the hunters thus presumably begins soon after the action depicted in The Unicorn Is Found, and the scene is one filled with chaos and commotion. The ferocity of the battle is conveyed by the converging lances aimed at the animal, the sounding of the hunting horns, and the menacing hounds. Already wounded on his back, the unicorn leaps across a stream in a desperate attempt to escape his encircling enemies.The use of hounds to scout, chase, and eventually attack the quarry was typical practice in medieval stag hunts, and the palatial buildings in the background might be a further allusion to the hunt as a royal or aristocratic pastime. Unlike The Hunters Enter the Woods and The Unicorn in Captivity, this and the other hangings are set in realistic landscapes that enhance the drama of the hunt.",'animal_fibre'

"John, Lord Dynham was a naval commander under five kings and treasurer of England from 1486 to 1501. The inscription around the garter is the motto of the Order of the Garter, to which Lord Dynham was appointed in 1487. The tapestry was probably woven to commemorate this event. The supporters in the form of stags -- or harts -- refer to Lord Dynham's family seat, Hartland. The repeated device of the topcastle of a warship with javelins leaning against the railing and swallow-tailed pennants flying above refers to Lord Dynham's distinguished naval career.",'animal_fibre'
"Part of a larger set, this remarkable corner settee and its pair, also in the Museum, were commissioned by one of the most powerful figures in eighteenth-century Franconia, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim (1708–1779). Prince-bishop of Würzburg and, after 1757, also of Bamberg, Seinsheim divided his time between two official residences in those cities and his three summer castles, Veitschöchheim, Werneck, and Seehof.[1] Preferring the country to the city, Seinsheim spent about three months a year outside Bamberg, at Seehof, where he enjoyed walking and hunting. He was fond of gardens and did much to embellish the late-seventeenth-century castle and especially its park, where he ordered that a maze, a theater, and a cascade with grotto and trelliswork arcades be constructed.In 1761 he also resumed work on one of the ancillary buildings at Seehof, the Franckenstein Schlösschen. This garden pavilion at the east end of the orangery and greenhouses had been conceived as a place where the prince could retreat from the strict etiquette at his court. Built by the architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel (1703–1769) for one of Seinsheim's predecessors, Johann Philipp Anton von Franckenstein, prince-bishop from 1746 to 1753, the Schlösschen had been left unfinished at the time of Franckenstein's death. Contemporary records indicate that Seinsheim decided to have its two main rooms, the Saal and the Audience Chamber (also called the Arbor Room, or berceau), embellished with frescoes and stuccowork. All four walls of the Audience Chamber were to be decorated as an illusionary arbor with trelliswork and floral festoons. Franz Anton Ermeltraut, court painter at Würzburg, was commissioned to execute a small trompe l'oeil ceiling fresco. It is not known when this was finished because the work was delayed by occasional disputes between the patron and the painter and the latter's frequent illnesses.[2] No description of the room's interior was made when the Franckenstein Pavilion was demolished in the nineteenth century, but a drawing thought to be Ermeltraut's design for the Arbor Room has been preserved, illustrating its intended decoration.[3] Also, an inventory of 1774 at Schloss Seehof mentions a ""Grünes Perceau-zimmer,"" or Green Trelliswork Room, in the garden pavilion, showing that the room had been completed by then as planned.Among the furnishings listed were the two settees, together with a pair of matching armchairs and four side chairs that are also in the Museum's collection.[5] In addition, there were four wall brackets hanging in niches, two of which have been preserved as well.[6] These furnishings were described as ""von bildhauer Arbeith grün Lassirt,"" or carved and glazed green.Both the settees and the matching chairs have serpentine gilded frames consisting of large scrolls of various shapes and openwork aprons decorated with polychrome flowers and foliage. They are supported on slightly curved legs carved with a pattern of reeds, and rest on bun feet that are partly covered by foliage. Most unusual is the off-white studded latticework intertwined with gilded and painted foliage on the inner backs of the seats; this must have been in total harmony with the original setting of the furniture. The outer backs of the settees and armchairs were left unfinished, as they were intended to stand against the wall; the side chairs, however, have latticework carving on both sides and were meant to be seen in the round. Corresponding to the inventory description of 1774, traces of a green glaze, originally applied over the gilding, are still present on the furniture.[7] Subsequent inventories offer additional details about the pieces, mentioning their green silk-velvet seat cushions and their placement.[8] Being rather top-heavy and unsteady, the settees stood in two corners of the room and the armchairs are described as being fastened in the other two. Grooves in the outer backs of the settees seem to imply that they too were once secured to the walls of the room.It is, unfortunately, not known who was the maker of this unique garden-room furniture so expressive of the exuberant Rococo taste. Its sculptural silhouette and elaborate carving, the choice of linden wood, and the unusual construction and simple joinery all make it seem likely that a sculptor or master carver rather than a cabinetmaker was responsible for the set.[9] It has been suggested that Margravine Sophie Caroline von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1737–1817), of neighboring Bayreuth, presented the suite to Seinsheim.[10] This would explain the absence of bills in Seehof's archival records. The margravine is known to have visited Seinsheim regularly, and pieces of furniture were occasionally exchanged between them. Also in favor of a Bayreuth provenance is the florid style of the pieces: Rococo furniture of Bayreuth was characterized by unrestricted use of naturalistic motifs, such as flowers, foliage, reeds, and birds. There was also a preference in Bayreuth for naturalism in interiors. Several rooms in the more recent of Bayreuth's two castles, the Neues Schloss, were decorated before 1760 in imitation of latticework pavilions, the first examples of their kind in Germany.[11] A complete set of furniture would have been an unusually large gift, however. Since the Museum's suite was in such perfect harmony with its original setting, and given Seinsheim's attention to the smallest details of Seehof's embellishments, it seems more likely that the prince-bishop ordered it himself. With the exception of a corner settee in the Würzburg Residenz, no other pieces known today bear even the slightest resemblance to the Seehof set.[12] For this reason, and in the absence of contemporary documents, it is impossible to attribute the furniture to a specific artist.The settees, chairs, and wall brackets presumably remained in the Franckenstein Pavilion until it was pulled down, between 1867 and 1870, and were then transferred to the castle itself. Seehof, which was in the possession of the bishopric and then part of the Bavarian royal domain until 1842, had become the private property of Freiherr Friedrich von Zandt and his descendants. Photographs taken at the turn of the century and later show the furniture in the Zandt family dining room.[13] They indicate that large carved flowers, now missing, originally adorned the cresting of the frames. The castle survived World War II intact, but the interior furnishings were sold off after the death in 1951 of the last male heir of the Zandt family.[14] In 1956 the Munich antiques dealer Fischer-Böhler sold this exceptional seat furniture to the New York collector Emma A. Sheafer. At that time the chairs and settees were upholstered in eighteenth-century painted Chinese silk, and only the trelliswork carving on the outer backs of the side chairs was left uncovered. Mrs. Sheafer never knew the full splendor of the furniture that filled the dining room of her New York City apartment. It was with their painted silk show covers that the furniture came to the Museum as part of her bequest in 1973. Once the fabric had been taken off, a conservation campaign was undertaken. This included the reconstruction of the foliage around the inner edge of the frames, which had been cut away to accommodate the upholstery; the removal of later paint layers on the trelliswork; and the manufacture of seat cushions covered in velvet to match the originals.[15][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide 2006]Footnotes:[1] Much of the information in this entry is taken from Kisluk-Grosheide 1990.

They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, pp. 171–72.[8] See the inventories of 1802, room 57B, and 1817–18, p. 37, no. 2A, transcripts of which are kept in the archives at Schloss Seehof.[9] Linden wood was more often used for sculpture than for furniture during this period. Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, p. 169.[10] This was suggested by the Munich dealer Fischer-Böhler.[11] Kisluk-Grosheide 1990, pp. 156–57, fig. 23.[12] Heinrich Kreisel attributed the Würzburg settee to Johann Köhler, an otherwise unknown sculptor, who was paid for ""sculptural work [and/or] carving executed in the newly furnished chamber in the princely residence""; Kreisel 1930, pp. 29–30.

"an one comprehend the feeling of eternity.Endowed with cosmological and metaphysical significance and empowered to communicate the deepest feelings, the qin, beloved of sages and of Confucius, is the most prestigious instrument in China. Han-dynasty writers state that the qin helped to cultivate character, understand morality, supplicate gods and demons, enhance life, and enrich learning. Ming-dynasty literati who claimed the right to play the qin suggested that it be played outdoors in a mountain setting, a garden, a small pavillion, or near an old pine tree (symbol of longevity) while burning incense to perfume the air. A serene moonlit night was considered an appropriate time for performance. Each part of the instrument is identified by an anthropomorphic or zoomorphic name and cosmology is ever present: for example, the upper board of wutong wood symbolizes heaven, the bottom board of zi wood symbolizes earth.

"This pictorial panel is unusual in that it is worked almost entirely in crewel wool thread, with only details and highlights in silk and metallic threads. Wool was commonly used for tent stitch or needlework on canvas from the sixteenth century, but this fiber is unusual in pictorial works such as this. Wool is more commonly found on bed furnishings of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries on a cotton twill foundation fabric.The presence of initials and a date probably indicate that this was an amateur production in both design and execution. The composition, which is extraordinarily crowded and naive, even within the genre of seventeenth-century pictures, is a small compendium of religious imagery, each story rendered in a kind of shorthand with only the key scene in the narrative nestled within the pictorial landscape conventions of this type. Hagar and Ishmael, banished from the home of Abraham, exit the scene in the lower left corner, while the princess of Egypt finds the baby Moses to the right. The river that delivered Moses flows from a rocky grotto, home to a mermaid, several types of fantastic fish, and a duck. Above the mermaid’s head at the right, Rebecca offers a drink to Eliezer from an antique urn on which the date 1667 is embroidered. The identity of the king under the central canopy is not certain, but he most likely represents Solomon sitting in judgment, as a woman appears to be pleading for a child in the arms of a cavalier with a sword. This interpretation is strengthened by the presence of a colorful moth or butterfly below the king. If we accept this as a symbol of the restoration of the Stuart monarchy, then the biblical Solomon, with whom King Charles I (father of the contemporary king) had been identified, would have been an appropriate choice. The rest of the panel is populated with flora and fauna, rendered with a typical disregard for relative scale, and a stately home with two small faces behind the mica windows. This particular conflation of religious and secular imagery is interesting for its visual emphasis on the central figure of the king, with other references scattered in a seemingly random fashion around the composition.[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",'animal_fibre'

"This deep red satin chasuble was embroidered in China. Its slender, A-line shape was common in chasubles of eighteenth-century Spain, where it may have been used.¹ The focal point of the embroidered design is the roundel with a double-headed eagle at the center of the vestment’s front and back. Although the double-headed eagle surmounted by a crown was a symbol of the Habsburg monarchy, here it is purely decorative and tinged with an auspicious Chinese flavor.² Instead of grasping arrows in their talons, as they would in the Habsburg motif, the birds dangle flowering and leafy stems from their beaks. In Chinese textiles auspicious birds frequently hold symbolic flora: a rank badge in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection features a crane that grips a branch bearing both a peach and a peach blossom.³ The front and back of the chasuble are each divided into three vertical sections, separated by narrow embroidered floral trim that also borders the neck and edges.⁴ The central section consists of a series of vertically aligned roundels, floral rosettes, and geometrically decorated vessels resting on stands amid a simple ogival pattern of flowering vines. On each of the two side sections, a graceful design of delicately curving leafy stems emerges from a multicolored cornucopia, a long-standing European motif. Cornucopias are included in at least two other eighteenth-century chasubles embroidered in China, one now in the Metropolitan and the other in the Museo Nacional del Virreinato, Tepotzotlan, Mexico, and formerly in the Catedral de Mexico—a reminder that there were markets besides Europe for chasubles embroidered in China.⁵ The scrolling pattern of the side panels is punctuated with large flowers, some of which include elements from Chinese decorative arts and others that are unusual from a Chinese perspective—even quite fantastic. The large flowers close to the cornucopias on the front of the garment and flanking the eagle roundel on the back are rather unrefined in technique, featuring dots on their radiating petals and a bold red, white, yellow, and blue coloration that lacks the more subtle shades of light red seen in the smaller flowers nearby, a customary coloration in Chinese embroidery. As dotted petals are fairly common in Indian floral textiles of the eighteenth century but unusual in Chinese examples, these bold flowers and other similarly distinctive blooms may reflect the Chinese embroiderer’s attempt to mimic the Indian floral patterns that were so popular in international trade.

"In 1785 Louis XVI purchased the Château de Saint Cloud in Marie Antoinette's name from the duc d'Orléans. The château, situated on a hillside overlooking the Seine not far from Paris, became the queen's favorite summer residence. Built in the sixteenth century and rebuilt during the seventeenth, the palace was in need of renovation. The architect Richard Mique (1728–1794) enlarged and altered it, and appropriate furnishings were ordered for the queen's apartment.Many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené (1748–1803), a member of an important dynasty of Parisian chair makers who received a royal appointment in 1784. Sené provided a set of seat furniture for the queen's dressing room, called her cabinet particulier ox cabinet de toilette that is described in the 1789 inventory of Saint Cloud. The daybed (41.205.1), the bergère (a comfortable chair upholstered between the arms and the seat, 41.205.2), and the fire screen (41.205.3a, b) from the set are now in the Museum's collections. They were the gift of Ann Payne Blumenthal, the second wife of George Blumenthal. The painted and gilt frame of the low daybed is embellished with floral motifs. Six short tapering and fluted legs surmounted by Ionic capitals support the piece. The front stiles of the head- and footboard, which are of equal height, are carved with female half-figures wearing Egyptian headdresses. The bergère, which has a medallion with Marie Antoinette's initials on its top rail, is decorated in a similar manner. A decade before Napoleon's North African campaign was to inspire the fashion known as égyptomanie, the queen appears to have had a taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art. Seated classical female figures, rather than Egyptian caryatids, decorate the feet of the fire screen, and a woman who once held a cornucopia reclines on its top. The carver is not known, but Louis-François Chatard (ca. 1749–1819) was responsible for painting and gilding the frames.According to the 1789 inventory the set was originally upholstered in a white-twilled cotton with rows of individual flowers embroidered by the queen herself. When the three pieces came to the Museum in 1941 only the fire screen's show cover had survived. Although the cotton ground is much discolored, Marie Antoinette's interlaced initials, composed of blossoms embroidered in satin stitch, are in remarkably good condition.",'vegetal_fibre'

"This woven fragment belongs to the upper part of an opreg cu ciucuri, a fringed apron traditionally worn by women from the Banat area of Romania and Serbia. The warp of the fragment's ground woven component is made of course, long wool fibers from the back of Turcana sheep. Highly twisted during spinning and dying, these fibers give desirable weight and stiffness to the apron.

"During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, Gujarat, in western India, supplied embroideries of the highest quality to the Mughal court; these textiles became valued commodities in Europe as soon as sea trade with that region was established. The Portuguese were the first Europeans to enter this market, but most surviving Gujarati embroideries relate to trade with England, which increased in the early seventeenth century.¹ Over the course of the seventeenth century, as the Gujarati embroiderers adjusted their output for the English market, they adopted the common motif of pink flowers detailed in yellow that bloom from dark green vines with light green or yellow veins. In the background are spotted leopards, striped deer, squirrels, birds, and other chain-stitched beasts filled with bands of color or details in contrasting hues. These elements are understood to have been culled from a variety of sources including English embroideries, examples of which must have been sent to India as models (see e.g. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, nos. 53.2202 and 53.172). But as English embroidery was itself responding to the influx of Asian textiles, incorporating and adapting many foreign motifs, the result was a mix of European, Indian, and Chinese imagery that then fed back to its original sources in a totally transformed state. This piece, consisting of several panels that have been joined and then quilted to form a bed-size coverlet, includes the motifs found on seventeenth-century coverlets but must have been made in the early eighteenth century, when an overall pattern of rinceaux enclosing flowers became more common.² However, Gujarati production is remarkable for its variety; at the same time, embroiderers were also producing patterns related to French bizarre silks and palampore designs (see e.g. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, no. 57.168).

"This marvelously preserved tapestry representing two angels playing on harps of gold against a rich floral ground is an exemplary demonstration of the character and style of the tapestries made at the Merton Abbey Tapestry Works under the direction of William Morris. Morris founded the workshop at Merton, in Surrey, near London, in1881 as part of his vision to use the integrity of medieval craftsmanship to revitalize the art and design of postindustrial Britain. These angelic figures were first conceived in 1878 for a stained glass window for Salisbury Cathedral by Edward Burne-Jones, Morris's lifelong friend and collaborator. In 1894 the figures and those in another window design provided the inspiration for two new tapestry cartoons painted by John Henry Dearle, the principal weaver and designer at the tapestry works. Dearle enhanced the linear emphasis and patterning of Burne-Jones's figures by placing them on a millefleur ground inspired by medieval tapestries. This tapestry is the second weaving of the design. It was commissioned by Major Charles Sydney Goldman as a stand-alone panel, possibly in anticipation of his impending marriage.",'vegetal_fibre'

"Upon Degas's death in 1917, more than 150 figurative sculptures were found in his studio. Most were made of fragile wax, clay, and plastiline (a wax- and oil-based modeling material). Many had deteriorated. Only a few were preserved in copies that had been cast from them in plaster. Except for the wax Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer (Washington: NGA) none of these sculptures had been publicly exhibited during the artist’s lifetime.Although Degas had not favored reproducing his sculptures in more permanent materials, his heirs authorized that copies be cast in bronze in order to preserve the compositions and to sell them as finished works. Paul-Albert Bartholomé, a sculptor and Degas's longtime friend, prepared 72 of the figures for casting, a process executed by the distinguished Paris foundry A.-A. Hébrard et Cie. The quality of the Degas bronzes was tightly controlled and their edition was limited. Only twenty-two editions of the series of 72 figures were cast. Each bronze within the series was assigned a number from one to seventy-two. The first twenty editions were assigned a letter from A-T. In most cases these numbers and letters were incised on the individual bronzes.The series of 72 bronzes was completed before May 1921 when it was exhibited in Paris. Edition A, comprising the first and best casts of the series, was reserved for the important Impressionist collector Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer. She later acquired the first bronze cast of the Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer (lettered A, but not numbered), which had been omitted from the initial series.

"In 1785 Louis XVI purchased the Château de Saint Cloud (fig. 49) in Marie Antoinette's name from the duc d'Orléans. The château, situated on a hillside overlooking the Seine not far from Paris, became the queen's favorite summer residence. Built in the sixteenth century and rebuilt during the seventeenth, the palacewas in need of renovation. The architect Richard Mique (1728-1794) enlarged and altered it, and appropriate furnishings were ordered for the queen's apartment.Many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sene (1748-1803), a member of an important dynasty of Parisian chair makers who received a royal appointment in 1784. Sene provided a set of seat furniture for the queen's dressing room, called her cabinet particulier ox cabinet de toilette that is described in the 1789 inventory of Saint Cloud. The daybed, the bergère (a comfortable chair upholstered between the arms and the seat), and the fire screen from the set are now in the Museum's collections (figs. 50?57). They were the gift of Ann Payne Blumenthal, the second wife of George Blumenthal. The painted and gilt frame of the low daybed (fig. 50) is embellished with floral motifs. Six short tapering and fluted legs surmounted by Ionic capitals support the piece. The front stiles of the head- and footboard, which are of equal height, are carved with female half-figures wearing Egyptian headdresses (fig. 51). The berg?re (fig. 52), which has a medallion with Marie Antoinette's initials on its top rail (fig. 53), is decorated in a similar manner. A decade before Napoleon's North African campaign was to inspire the fashion known as égyptomanie, the queen appears to have had a taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art. Seated classical female figures, rather than Egyptian caryatids, decorate the feet of the fire screen (figs. 54, 55), and a woman who once held a cornucopia reclines on its top. The carver is not known, but Louis-François Chatard (ca. 1749-1819) was responsible for painting and gilding the frames.According to the 1789 inventory the set was originally upholstered in a white-twilledcotton with rows of individual flowers embroidered by the queen herself. When the three pieces came to the Museum in 1941 only the fire screen's show cover (fig. 56)had survived. Although the cotton ground is much discolored, Marie Antoinette'sinterlaced initials, composed of blossoms embroidered in satin stitch, are in remarkably good condition (see fig. 57).",'vegetal_fibre'

They are worn over the tunic (kurta) cloak-fashion, covering the head and shoulders, with the long vestigial sleeves hanging down the back and joined by an embroidered band. Among the Tekke, the chyrpy's color indicated the age of the wearer: dark blue or black for a young woman, yellow for a married woman of middle age, and white for a matriarch. The motifs were most frequently stylized flowers, and especially the tulip, the most prolific wildflower of the region.

"This chasuble is constructed from a most unusual textile, from which two distinct designs were taken to create the front and back of the vestment. The back of the garment, shown here, was made from a portion of the fabric with a pattern of repeating mound-shaped motifs enclosed in an ogival frame linked by floral sprays; the front uses a pattern of red diamond-shaped motifs resting on a blue band, which once appeared on each side of the repeating-mound pattern. A departure from most of the dyed cloths made for export on India’s Coromandel Coast, this textile finds its closest visual parallel in a group of European brocaded silks now referred to as ""lace-patterned."" These eighteenth-century textiles are characterized by the use of large-scale motifs, especially streamers and floral sprays, which are set against delicate, lacelike diaper patterning and floral vines. Although these silks were related to contemporary eighteenth-century fashions in lace, at the time they may have been known as ""persiennes"" and were seen as having an exotic Eastern flair (see MMA 61.80.2). The relationship between this cloth and its European prototype is less direct than that of other Indian dyed cloths modeled after the so-called lace-patterned silks, samples of which must have been taken to India for the textile dyers to copy (see MMA 36.90.12). Both this fabric and a very similar one used to make a Dutch wentke recently acquired by the Metropolitan (MMA 2012.561) have diamond-shaped motifs and ogival frames linked by floral sprays, showing a reliance on the same European textile source. The prototype may have been Italian, as these fabrics reveal intriguing resemblances to Italian examples from the first quarter of the eighteenth century, which have comparably robust designs.¹ The style of the chasuble ・ combining aspects of Austrian and southern German fashions of the mid-eighteenth century ・ suggests that the fabric was traded to central Europe.

"The Palace of St. Cloud belongs to the Duke of Orleans, is situated on the declivity of a mountain washed by the Seine. . . . The view from the house is delightful.— Harry Peckham, A Tour through Holland . . .and Part of FranceLouis XVI purchased the country residence of the duc d’Orléans a few miles west of Paris for Marie-Antoinette in 1785. Being in need of renovation, the palace was enlarged and altered for the queen, and many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené. A member of an important dynasty of Parisian chairmakers, Sené had been appointed menuisier to the Crown in 1784.A detailed 1788 description of this set, which also included four matching armchairs and a stool, indicates that the pieces were intended for one of Marie-Antoinette’s private rooms at Saint-Cloud, her Cabinet Particulier. The frame of the daybed, originally longer but shortened at a later date, is embellished with carving of ivy on the seat rail and garlands of roses along the crest rail. Ionic capitals surmount the short legs, and most remarkable of all are the Egyptian female half-figures on tapering supports that decorate the front stiles. Even though in his bill Sené called them simply caryatids, these figures clearly express the queen’s taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art, well before Napoléon’s North African campaign made it fashionable. Similar ornament is found on the bergère (a comfortable armchair upholstered between the arms and the seat ), which, in addition, has a medallion on top with Marie-Antoinette’s initials framed by myrtle branches and roses. The matching screen, however, displays classical female figures on its feet and top rail. Unfortunately, the identity of the sculptor is not known, but Louis-François Chatard is documented as having painted and gilded the wooden surfaces.The 1789 inventory of Saint-Cloud records the entire suite in the queen’s Cabinet de Toilette, or dressing room. Listed by its show covers, as was customary for seat furniture, the set is described as being upholstered in white cotton twill, embroidered with a small floral ornament in silk. Known to have worked on needlepoint projects all her life, Marie-Antoinette did the embroidery herself, which she executed in satin stitch. Modern replicas of the queen’s handiwork, including her interlaced monogram on the panel of the fire screen, grace the frames of the furniture today. The colorful floral embroidery on the light cotton ground conveys a sense of summer, the season Marie-Antoinette preferred to spend at Saint-Cloud.Epigraph. Peckham 1788, p. 199.",'vegetal_fibre'
"While the Portuguese were undoubtedly the first importers and consumers of the Indian embroideries made for the western European market, at least a few examples of these textiles did appear in England by the late sixteenth century. The 1601 inventory of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury (1527-1608), included two quilts that were almost certainly products of this trade: “a quilt of yellow India stuff embroidered with birds and beasts” and “a quilt of India stuff embroidered with beastes.""¹ Indian quilts of the type produced for the Portuguese market appeared with increasing frequency in London sales into the 1620s, when their value began to decline, perhaps because of diminishing novelty.²The taste for Indian-style embroidery remained, however, and it is interesting to note that the English maker of this textile used not only the Indian palette of golden yellow on white but also an imported Indian cotton as the foundation. The cover has rare seventeenth-century marks on the plain-weave cotton fabric: the initials G.C.E. (for the English East India Company's original name, The Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies) as well as three other stamps whose significance has not yet been deciphered.³ On this bedcover, the embroidered designs draw heavily on such exotic motifs as pineapple-like vegetation and serrated leaves, but contemporary European sensibilities are also evident in the strapwork connecting the floral elements. Additionally, the three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the use of stitches with long floats that create a shinier surface to contrast with the matte appearance of the cotton ground diverge from the Indian prototypes, whose flatter chain stitches are less glossy. English bedcovers were usually part of coordinated sets that could include bolsters, pillows, and matching valances⁴In addition to the more common monochrome yellow-on white embroideries, Indian polychrome embroideries also arrived in England during the early seventeenth century. They, too, are described in sale records; for example, a 1614 sale included “a carpet or quilt embroidered upon calico with sundry silks.""⁵  The word “carpet” is probably used in its contemporaneous sense, that is, to signify decorative covers for a variety of furniture types, including beds. MMA 1970.173, an English polychrome silk and metal-thread bedcover, is more obviously dependent on the stylistic composition of Persian and Turkish carpets than this textile. By the eighteenth century, both embroidered and painted cotton textiles of this type, with a central medallion and smaller medallions in the corners of the central field, were being made in India for domestic consumption and for export.⁶  These imported polychrome covers had a lasting influence on the production of English embroidered bed furnishings of the eighteenth century.

"Embroidered in China, this depiction of the abduction of Helen is monumental both in scale and in the freedom granted to the embroiderers, who included many Chinese motifs and interpretations within a purely Western narrative. A quintessential account in the Western classical tradition, the story of the Trojan War inspired large sets of European tapestries; the earliest documented set was presented to Charles the Bold in 1472.¹ This embroidered hanging, too, was part of a large set, of which the Metropolitan Museum owns three, and four are preserved in other collections.² All have the same border, including an armorial at each corner that does not correspond completely with any known arms. Perhaps it is an erroneous rendering of the arms of the Mascarenhas family of Portugal; the nobleman Francisco Mascarenhas served as governor of Macau from 1623 to 1626. The abduction of Helen ignited war between Troy and Greece; this version, in which Helen is forcibly seized, relies on postclassical sources.³ Against a backdrop of European-style buildings with Baroque facades and struggling armored figures, a protesting Helen is carried off by two men, away from her white-bearded husband, Menelaus, and toward a boat on the right where the Trojan prince Paris awaits. No single print source has yet been found, but the subject matter and composition of the hanging were surely based on European sources.⁴The Chinese embroiderers were responsible for many details from the Chinese decorative vocabulary, such as the waves in the background, the phoenixes in the center of the upper border, various details of the armor, the scales of the serpents and tritons in the border, and the lychee fruit seen outlined against the side of the boat. While most of the hanging is embroidered, the figures’ faces and exposed limbs were painted directly on the cotton foundation cloth, probably also in China. Especially in the faces, the modeling of light and shadow for a three-dimensional effect, while naively done, shows an aspect of European-style painting that had reached East Asia with Jesuit missionaries in the sixteenth century. The Italian Jesuit Giovanni Niccolo (or Nicolao, 1563–1626) established an academy of painting in Japan in 1583 to train local artists to produce religious art. When the missionaries’ relations with Japanese authorities deteriorated, Niccolo fled Japan, returning to Macau in 1614. Some of his students became active in China, including You Wenhui (baptized Manoel Pereira, 1575–1633), a young Chinese from Macau, and Ni Yicheng (also known as Jacopo Niva, 1579–1635), of Japanese and Chinese parentage. You Wenhui produced the only surviving painted portrait of the Jesuit leader Matteo Ricci (1552–1610).⁵ The more highly regarded Ni Yicheng had studied at Niccolo’s academy in Japan, and in China he ""was in constant demand to paint works . . . both for the mission in China and the Jesuits’ church in Macau.""⁶ Perhaps these artists or less well-documented colleagues were responsible for painting this textile.  Scientific analysis of the hanging’s pigments supports this intercultural possibility: results show a blue-green pigment not used in Asia and a white not used in Europe. Furthermore, the white pigment occurs more frequently in Japanese than in Chinese contexts.⁷[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1.

"One of a group of textiles whose production is attributed to the area of Satgaon in Bengal¹, coverlets such as this were made primarily for the Portuguese market, hence the Portuguese term (colcha) by which they are known. In the early seventeenth century they also fetched high prices at auctions in England and seem to have influenced the production of embroidery there (see MMA 34.104.1 and MMA 1970.173). Characterized by the use of yellow tussah silk embroidery on a white cotton ground, they typically depict a combination of classical, biblical, and Hindu themes, although a few draw from other sources (see e.g. Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, no. T20e4). This colcha is embellished with a selection of vignettes found on several others, including an almost identical example in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon.² Successive bands around the border depict a hunt, the Labors of Hercules, and the story of Arion, while the center panel features the Judgment of Solomon surrounded by stories from the book of Judith: the siege of Bethulia (bottom right), Judith before Holofernes (top right), Judith beheads Holofernes (top left), and the severed head of Holofernes displayed from the walls of Bethulia (bottom left). Vignettes from classical mythology include Actaeon transformed into a stag by Diana (above the Solomon scene), Hercules shooting the Lernean Hydra (detail), and the story of Phaeton, who drove the chariot of the sun too close to Earth, scorching the planet and causing the animals to die (in the triangular panel below Hercules). While the themes of these coverlets can be generally related to contemporary European tapestries and textiles, which also mix biblical and classical tales, the depiction of the protagonists in seventeenth-century Portuguese garb and the addition of Hindu imagery (such as the story of the Vishnu avatar Matsya, the fishtailed figure in the second band from the center) must represent the traditions and imagination of the embroiderers who created them. The circulation of northern European prints and illustrated Bibles at the Mughal court is well documented, but the sources available to the Bengali embroiderers remain obscure and probably represent an entirely different category of material. The inventiveness of the embroidery is further underscored by comparison to those made for the local market. Two pieces that likely date to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century are embroidered in multicolored silk, and their design is composed of circular medallions enclosing lotus patterns, interlocking star shapes, and bands of human figures and animals.³ Here, then, the switch to an almost monochrome yellow and white palette, the composition of concentric panels and bands, and the addition of foreign iconography were innovations for this particular type of export, which was produced only until the mid-seventeenth century.

"Renowned for their knotted-pile carpets and storage bags, Turkmen weavers also produced magnificent examples of wearable art such as this remarkable coat. The decoration of the exterior consists of geometric and abstract floral motifs and is among the best examples of Turkmen embroidery. The abstract exterior decoration contrasts with the interior of the coat, which is lined with a bright floral-printed cotton made in Russia. The coat, a rare example of its type, is likely the work of either the Chodor or Yomut Turkmen.",'vegetal_fibre'

"This set of vestments, comprising a chasuble, stole, maniple, chalice veil and a burse, was made for the cardinal whose arms are seen on the chasuble’s back orphrey. Although not woven or embroidered with silver and silver-gilt threads, it was nevertheless well-suited for a ‘Prince of the Church’; it is tailored from a fine ivory taffeta and the entire ornament is most minutely and delicately worked with pen and Indian ink. As the minuscule inscription in the bottom of the front orphrey reveals, it was done by Saverio Caselli: a priest, architect and cartographer in the service of the Papal States. Working mostly in Rome and Benevento, Caselli held numerous prestigious roles and served as an honorary chamberlain to Pope Pius VII. As a renowned archaeologist and antiquarian he authored many detailed drawings of ancient Roman monuments, such as the Roman theatre and the Arch of Trajan in Benevento. It took him six years to finish the intricate and laborious task of ornamenting this extraordinary set of vestments. Caselli’s remarkable talent and interest in antiquities are reflected in the outstanding decorations which were drawn on the silk with an utmost precision, leaving a misleading first impression that they were achieved by printing.",'animal_fibre'

"Covering one’s head was an essential aspect of etiquette in the 19th century.  During the 1840s, women wore caps indoors and bonnets outdoors.  The bonnet has wide brim sheltering the face, reflecting the heightened sense of propriety brought in when Queen Victoria ascended the throne in 1837.  

Fashions in hats and headwear changed more quickly than other items of clothing.  While a dress would be expected to last at least a decade, new styles of hats arrived annually.  The latest fashion in bonnets usually featured the latest fabrics and trimmings, rather than a new shape.  Most 19th-century women expected a new hat each year, even if it meant recovering an old one themselves.   Personal accounts for this period show women buying new ribbons, laces, fabrics and trimmings to update their headwear.",'animal_fibre'

The central triangular panel has a red ground, with a gold lion outlined in red in the centre; the lion's mouth is open and the tongue extended. The upper half of the Sun lies behind the lion's back, in silver with gold pointed rays outlined in red. Two red locks of hair fall from a point above the forehead of the Sun; they fall over the lion's back and curl outwards. The nose and eyebrows of the Sun's face are formed from the same red line, and there is a gold and red disc in the middle of the brow. The pattern on the red ground, of silver floral decoration and inscriptions within shaped cartouches, is rather clumsily interrupted by the lion and Sun and the edges are abrupt, although some floral stems have been placed around the lion's feet. The ground appears to be silver divided into a lattice. The inscriptions, forming a quatrain, alternate in vertical bands; each row of cartouches contains a repeating single verse, the rows read 'down' to repeat the quatrain. 

The broad border consists of three bands:
[1] silver ground with a fine blue meander, linking a diagonal leaf and a four-petalled flower either side of a wider silver band containing an inscription.

However, the shoes are covered in a brocaded silk that was made much earlier, about 1705-1710. Uppers and soles were cut separately and sold on to shoemakers who adapted them for their customers. From about 1700-1750 the colours and materials of fashionable women's shoes often reflected the elegance of their gowns. In this case, it is possible that the floral pattern and colours of the silk shoes were quite similar to the fabric used for the gown.

"By the 1870s Kashmir shawls had been in fashion for nearly a century. The advent of slimmer fashions and the bustled skirt meant that shawls became outdated. Some were transformed into figure-hugging mantles or dolmans, lavishly trimmed and lined to match the colours of the shawl pattern. 

Ornate trimmings positioned on the back of this dolman accentuate its bustled silhouette and complement the paisley patterned textile. Rich passementerie such as tassles, rosettes, braid, cords, tufts, and fringe frequently embellished women's fashionable dress, creating luxurious effects resembling the trimmings found on curtains and upholstery.

These trimmings took hours of highly skilled work to complete.The example illustrated here incorporates three long pointed wooden moulds wrapped in blue floss silk. These are then decorated with a multicoloured cord, which must have been made specifically for this garment, as the colours harmonize exactly.",'animal_fibre'

"Puffs of linen lawn interspersed with bands of silk satin and lace give this sleeve a filmy, weightless quality. They are reminiscent of the puffings on 1620s gowns which swelled out above and below the elbow, confined at intervals by ribbons. This device had been used throughout the nineteenth century in one form or another but it suited the light fabrics of 1860s summer dresses particularly well. It also complemented the fashionable ‘pannier-style’ skirts, which were looped, gathered or drawn up with strings into back and side puffs. 

The sleeve is cleverly constructed to create the impression of gossamer without losing its shape.  It is made from a piece of linen lawn gathered into a series of puffs which are sewn into position on the underside of the ribbon bands. Inside each puff four pieces of cord are held in place with stitches to maintain the correct tension. These are just visible through the transparent fabric and give the illusion that the puffs have been drawn up like a roman blind.  To complete the harmony, two frills trimmed with ribbon and lace delicately curve over the wrist and hand.",'animal_fibre'

A cap such as this one, gathered and full to suggest the shape of a turban, was popular for evening wear about 1820.   The Romantic movement created an interest in the dress of non-European countries, particularly North Africa and the Middle East.

"During the 1820s and 1830s women's dress took on a sense of romantic fantasy. Sleeves ballooned in shape, and skirts fanned out to emphasise a tiny waist. Hairstyles and headgear became equally exuberant, in contrast to the classical simplicity of the turn of the century. Decoration and trimmings reflected a nostalgia for the costume of the past, seen in stomacher-shaped bodices and 'vandyked' (zig-zag shaped) collars inspired by portraits from the seventeenth century.

This dress may well have been a wedding dress as it is so rich in detail and trimmings. White weddings were becoming widespread as a result of the fashion for muslin dresses. Before the 1800s most people wore coloured dresses to their marriage ceremony, which they continued to wear for special occasions long after the event.",'animal_fibre'

"Henry Irving (1838-1905) wore this costume in the title role of <i>Macbeth</i> by William Shakespeare (1564-1616). Irving had first performed the role of Macbeth when the Lyceum was still being managed by Mrs. Bateman in September of 1875. When he returned to the play in December of 1888 Irving again took the title role, but on this occasion Ellen Terry (1847-1928) played the part of Lady Macbeth. The play became one of the most successful productions in their repertoire, running for over 150 performances and was frequently revived on their tours of America.

Though few critics admired Irving's portrayal of Macbeth as a moral coward, all praised the power of his spectacular production. The play featured a lavish series of painted backdrops which conjured up a Celtic/Anglo Saxon vision of Scotland. It also included a musical score by Sir Arthur Sullivan (1842-1900). 

Charles Cattermole designed the costumes, apart from those worn by Ellen Terry, which were designed by Alice Comyns Carr. The vivid blood red cloak that became part of the costume Irving wore for the murder scene, was amongst those originally designed to be worn by Terry as Lady Macbeth. After observing the visual impact of this splash of colour at the first dress rehearsal however, Irving adopted this cloak for himself and Terry's costume designer hurriedly created a more subdued heather coloured cloak for the leading lady. 

Irving became a professional actor in 1856, and learned his trade in regional theatres until 1866, when he came to London.  He joined the Lyceum Theatre company under the management of H. L. Bateman in 1871, winning great acclaim that year for his psychologically developed characterisation of the guilt-ridden inn-keeper Mathias in Leopold Lewis's melodrama <i>The Bells</i>.  He took on the responsibilities of 'actor-manager' in 1878 when he assumed the management of the Lyceum, and remained there until 1902, enjoying star status with his leading lady Ellen Terry (1847-1928).   Irving produced a diverse range of old and new plays at the Lyceum, including Shakespeare, historical drama, and literary adaptations.  His tireless work to elevate the status of the theatrical profession was rewarded in 1895 when he became the first actor ever to receive a knighthood for services to the Theatre.

Irving specialised in spectacularly staged productions with large casts of performers. He commissioned designers and composers to create appropriate scenery, costume and incidental music, played by a full orchestra.  Although electric lighting was available from the 1880s, Irving preferred the softer effects of gas, with lime light to focus attention at key points in the play.  Irving toured complete productions outside London, taking the full company, scenery and costumes throughout the United Kingdom and across the United States and Canada.   The development of the railway system made his the first generation able to achieve this level of touring productions.",'animal_fibre'

"This waistcoat is very stiff because a thin layer of brown cardboard has been inserted between the red felt ground and its silk lining, giving it an armoured feel. The black silk cords have been couched through both felt and card. The physical stiffness is heightened by the use of rigid brass plaques as decoration. Each plaque is flat on one side and has been stitched onto the felt through a small hole at one end; the stitching has then been concealed beneath the cord edging. Scarlet wool and shiny brass are a military combination in many countries and the unbending character of this garment may have been inspired by such uniforms.",'animal_fibre'

The applied satin rolls and rosettes at the hem and shoulders were a new decorative trend in women’s dress, which was moving away from the very plain styles of earlier Neo-classical dress.

In each corner is a lion mask holding a ring. The four scenes are separated from one another by Corinthian columns. The upper parts of the columns are fluted, and the lower parts are covered with acanthus leaves against which is represented a female figure in classical dress with winged sandals and a winged helmet. Tall ornamental base on a square plinth.

From left to right, the scenes are as follows:

The first scene shows Mars in full armour in a chariot drawn by wolves with the Ram and the Scorpion in the clouds in the centre of the sky. The main scene has a detachment of troops, mounted and on foot, occupying a field over which they are driving the inhabitants. In the background are two detachments engaged with musketry against one another.

The next scene has Jupiter carrying a thunderbolt and an eagle in a chariot drawn by peacocks in the clouds in the centre of the sky. On the other side are the two signs of the zodiac, the Fish and Sagittarius. The main below is divided into various subjects. On the left is a pope crowning a king or emperor in the foreground, an astronomer busy with an astrolabe and other instruments. In the centre a king is consulting with councillors, and on the right a throned king is receiving a petitioner. In the background in the centre, a man is reading a royal declaration from a balcony to a crowd and over the door underneath the balcony is a date, possibly 1601. In the background on the right is an ecclesiastical procession going to a church and behind is a king on horseback with a canopy over him moving in procession to another church in the distance.

The third scene has Saturn sitting in a chariot drawn through the clouds in the centre of the sky drawn by griffins, and two small children accompany him. By him are the two signs of the zodiac, Aquarius and Capricorn. The main subject shows peasants on the left reaping and carrying wheat and ploughing. On the right are monks distributing bread and provisions to beggars and disabled people.

The last scene shows Fortuna. Seated on a globe in the clouds in the centre of the sky is a winged figure holding in its right hand part of its robe in a large curve over its head, and in its left hand is a vase. On the right in the sky is a small figure  holding a psyche and clutching at a child. On the right is a figure of Mercury with a winged helmet holding a purse in one hand, and in the other are various subjects, one of which is a tablet with the date 1591, and underneath are the letters ME [not clear] N.

"This object is part of a set of four armchairs and a settee that were made in France between 1780 and 1800.  The design of the frames was a very popular one and was made by a number of <i>menuisiers</i>, as the makers of carved furniture were called.  Some made highly carved versions, but these are simply moulded.  The tapestry covers were made some years earlier, for the kind of larger chairs that were fashionable in the 1750s and 1760s. They were only put on to these frames in the nineteenth century, when such tapestries became highly fashionable amongst antique collectors.

"By 1810, brightly coloured and embroidered silks were as popular as white cotton and muslin for women's evening dresses. John Heathcote's bobbinet machine, patented in 1809, enabled fine net to be easily produced in wide widths for dresses, which could be hand-embroidered to achieve individual and attractive effects. Net dresses were worn with underdresses of plain silk, sometimes white, or in a matching colour.

Chenille (French for caterpillar) is a type of thick thread made by a weaving process. Cotton or silk is woven into a length of cloth which is then cut into very narrow strips, the severed weft threads creating the tufts which give the yarn its velvety texture. The dense colour of chenille thread creates a contrasting effect with the ground fabric.

Fashion leaders such as Empress Josephine, Napoleon's first wife, helped to popularise dresses of machine net, or 'tulle', which was also produced in France. She owned many machine-made net dresses embroidered with silver or gold metal thread and spangles for formal court occasions.",'animal_fibre'

Britain
1845

White silk wedding waistcoats patterned with silver thread were popular in the 1840s and 1850s. The expensive metal threads made the fabric suitable for special occasions and silver, which has connotations of purity, was associated with weddings. John Montefiore, a London merchant trading in the West Indies, wore the waistcoat for his marriage to Julia Norman.

"Given the popularity of bull fighting in Spain, it is fitting that bulls should be embroidered around the square neck of this blouse. The neck opening has been finished with a woven upholstery braid; two holes have been punched along either side of it and a plaited cord has been threaded through for fastening the front.

The linen sleeve and the linen that forms the main part of the blouse have been gathered and decorated with embroidered bands and then attached to the edges of the embroidered neck panel. The gathers on the sleeve are not at the top of the arm but run across the shoulder at the point where the collarbone joins the shoulder blade.

It achieves a similar textural effect to the motifs on rich figured velvets which were used for men's court dress, but is a much simpler, cheaper fabric. 

Lyon was the main centre of silk-weaving in France from the late 17th century onwards and created the most fashionable silks in Europe. The patterns on these silks changed seasonally. This silk is one of the simpler silks made, though it would still have required the skills of a draughtsman who made a freehand sketch and then a technical drawing to show the weaver how to set up his loom.

"This stool was given to the V&A by Her Majesty Queen Mary (1867-1953), Consort of King George V.  The Queen was known as an avid collector who favoured jewellery, fans and miniature furniture for which she commissioned several dolls' houses, as well as objects with a royal association.  However, she was also one of the earliest collectors of Victorian decorative arts such as papier mâché and embroidery.  She later offered much of her collection on loan and as gifts to the V&A for its Victorian Galleries.  This stool is a good example of just the sort of decorative domestic object that appealed to the Queen.  

The stool is decorated with Berlin work or woolwork, a type of embroidery sometimes used for furnishings.  The name for this sort of work is derived from the type of wool used for it.  Berlin wool, also known as Berlin yarn or German wool, was a high quality worsted yarn spun from combed wool, with a harder twist than other yarns.

"This woven silk fabric with a floral repeat called 'Small Syringa' (lilac) was designed in 1874 by Edward William Godwin for Warner and Ramm. This is a later version of the original  'Syringa' design and is approximately half the size of the original. This sample shows a full width of the loom and may be a trial weaving kept by Warners for colour reference. It is probably a commercially popular variation which adapts the size and colouring of the original pattern to late-19th century fashions.

Godwin, an architect and interior designer, was interested in Far-Eastern art and was the first to use Japanese motifs in furnishings. He produced textile designs for several firms and said of those he created for Warner & Ramm : 'Such effects as I wanted I endeavoured to gain by the mere grouping of solid and void and by more or less unbroken outline.' The characteristic Japanese simplicity of line and colour is also seen in the work of his contemporaries, Christopher Dresser and B.J. Talbert. 

The silk weaving firm of Warner & Sons was founded in 1870 by Benjamin Warner, who trained at the Spitalfields School of Design in London. It has operated under several different names, and was called Warner & Ramm between 1875 and 1882.",'animal_fibre'

Passementerie in the form of crescent-shaped moulds, looped cord and balls covered in floss silk replace the gilt or silver buttons on some regimental coats. The tassels on the collar ends and cuff bands evoke the tassels adorning boots, hats, sashes and cap lines of military accessories. In place of epaulettes, puffed oversleeves composed of linked bows emphasize the shoulder line.

The infusion of military styles into fashionable dress in Britain was largely due to the influence of the Napoleonic Wars (1793-1815). Among other factors, contact with foreign troops had a strong impact on civilian as well as regimental dress, and military ornament was translated into stylish trimmings on women's hats, bodices, spencers and pelisses. The uniforms worn during this period were some of the most elaborate in the history of military dress, and their bright colours, frogging, braid and tassels fuelled the imagination of fashion for years to come. 

Although this walking outfit is not based on any particular uniform, some garments closely followed certain styles. The uniform of the hussars, who were light cavalry, was particularly flamboyant as it was derived from Hungarian national dress. In her memoirs, Elizabeth Grant describes the admiration she received when she 'walked out like a hussar in a dark cloth pelisse trimmed with fur and braided like the coat of a staff-officer, boots to match, and a fur cap set on one side, and kept on the head by means of a cord with long tassels'.",'animal_fibre'

"Embroidered waistcoats were worn as formal dress by women of the gentry and informal dress by aristocratic women.   They were long-sleeved upper garments, opening down the front and fitted at the waist using inserted gores.  Waistcoatswere worn with petticoats (skirts) and loose gowns over the top, accessorised with fine lace cuffs and ruffs or bands (collars). The tight-fitting sleeves and natural waistline of this example suggest a date between 1610 and 1620. 

While a number of embroidered linen waistcoats survive in museum collections, this is an unusual example of one made of silk.  Its embroidery pattern follows the characteristic design of this period, with scrolling stems.  However the floral motifs are quite abstract, moving away from the naturalism typical in embroidery in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

The waistcoat has been altered twice, first to reduce the fullness below the waist.  The second alteration was in increase the width across the back and around the armholes, either for the original wearer or for another larger person.",'animal_fibre'

"This repeating pattern of flowers and vegetation was designed by William Morris in 1879 and woven by Alexander Morton & Company for Morris and Company. Morris was the artist and designer who was the greatest single influence on the Arts and Crafts movement and the most successful textile designer and manufacturer of his day. Morris revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and in his own home he set up looms for tapestry weaving and the hand knotting of carpets. He was highly influenced by historical patterns and was one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of the late 19th century.

Morris & Co. was founded by William Morris in 1875, producing textiles commercially for sale in two London shops. Alexander Morton established his textile company in Scotland in 1867 and manufactured silk and wool fabrics and gauzes for Morris & Co. until Morris set up his Merton Abbey Works in 1881, where he produced his own textiles.

This example was exhibited in the Great Exhibition as part of a display dedicated to 'Fancy silks, as Shot, Figured, Embroidered, &c;'. A collection of textiles and fabrics from the Exhibition was presented to Her Majesty's Commissioners, and then to the Victoria & Albert Museum to act as a lasting memorial of the 1851 Exhibition. These textiles show the state of industry in 1851. In 1857, when they were exhibited at the Museum, the catalogue described them as providing  'a view both to technical instruction and to the ever-changing and increasing wants of trade in this great commercial country'.

"Silk and satin theatre programmes were frequently produced in the 18th and 19th centuries to commemorate special theatrical and musical events, the less expensive ones with integral fringing made from fraying cut edges, and the more expensive with separately applied silk or metallic fringes. This programme was produced for a command performance for Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle by Sir Augustus Harris's company from the Opera House Covent Garden, of two French operas, with scenery designed by the prolific scene designer Robert Caney. Since Queen Victoria did not go to the theatre after the death of Prince Albert in 1861, theatre, opera, and circus came to her, especially at Windsor.

The evening began with Charles Gounoud's mythological opera <i>Philémon et Baucis, </i>based on La Fontaine's tale of the gods Jupiter and Vulcan visiting the elderly couple Baucis and Philémon on earth and making them young again. The production had already had four performances at Covent Garden on 17th and 22nd May, 26th June and 5th July. It was followed by Jules Massenet's <i>La Navarraise</i>about the lowly girl Anita from Navarre whose love for the soldier Araguil results in her killing the enemy Commander to raise money for her dowry, and going mad herself. The French operatic star Emma Calvé (1858-1942), for whom<i> La Navarraise</i> was written, starred as Anita. The opera had received its international debut at Covent Garden the previous month, on the 20th June, with the Prince of Wales in attendance. 

Queen Victoria wrote about the evening in her diary, and although admiring the performance and music of Charles Gounod's <i>Philémon et Baucis</i> thought its plot 'silly and nonsensical' and that of <i>La Navarraise</i> 'very dramatic but dreadful'. She decided that music didn't have much melody, except the 'fine and expressive' overture, but enjoyed Emma Calvé's 'splendid performance' and her mad laugh at the end when her lover died .",'animal_fibre'
"Blue (muted sky blue) silk brocaded in polychrome silks and metal threads, the ground has a self-coloured pattern (foot-figured). The pattern is a point repeat (a mirror image about a vertical axis) and takes up the full width of the silk, comprising flowers and flower arrangements, bound together by elaborate golden arabesques. Three pattern repeats are visible lengthwise. The brocading or supplemenary wefts are as follows: two shades of a grass green for the stems; three shades of red for the smaller flowers; four shades of plum for one of the large flower types and four of a slightly different pinky red for the other large flower; metal threads for the hearts of flowers and small leaves and for the leaves and meanders that join up the pattern. These metal threads are both silver and gold, and in different qualities which catch the light in different ways - lame and filé (beaten flat or round like a wire). The play on light and shade, sparkle and matte is very sophisticated, the appearance of the fabric changing as the viewer moves round it. A very sparing, economical use of the metal threads is noticeable from the back of the fabric, where barely any silver or gold is evident.",'animal_fibre'
"From the 1830s Berlin woolwork dominated home embroidery.  The patterns were worked in merino wools from Germany on to canvas, and silks were introduced for texture and bright colour contrasts.  Thousands of printed charts were imported into England, each square representing a stitch, and many designs for bags and purses were available, as well as for other small objects such as slippers, or watch holders.  While much of the embroidery was worked simply and methodically, more complex stitches and patterns were often used for bags.  Small, geometric patterns were popular at first, but soon floral motifs became highly prevalent.  From the 1830s Berlin woolwork incorporated beads, resulting in compositions of great variety and colour.",'animal_fibre'

"Jacob-Desmalter was the largest and most fashionable supplier of furniture in Paris from about 1800 to 1820. The firm certainly made this stool, and its pair, although neither bears their stamped mark. A hand-written paper label inside one of the long seat rails is inscribed with the name of the client, Marshal Ney, and the name of the room for which it was provided, the Petit Salon. Jacob-Desmalter is the only maker known to have used this form of labelling. The seat rails of the stool have been replaced at some time and it is likely that the firm's stamped mark was lost at that time.

Marshal Ney (1769–1815) was a celebrated military hero in the Napoleonic army. After Napoleon was crowned as emperor in 1804, he was keen to establish his marshals as part of his imperial court. He arranged suitable marriages for several of them. Ney's wife, whose mother had been one of Queen Marie Antoinette's ladies-in-waiting before the French Revolution of 1789, was particularly successful in helping her husband to consolidate his position. In March 1805 they acquired a grand Paris house, the Hôtel de Saisseval, and immediately began to decorate and furnish it, using the firm of Jacob-Desmalter. The Petit Salon was one of the more simply decorated rooms in the house, with seat furniture in mahogany.

The decoration, with the body of the dead Christ accompanied by angels with fans and with the symbols or figures of the evangelists in the corners, is of conventional form.

The dedication also mentions <i>Prayer of the servant of God Nicholas Eudaimonoioannes with his wife and children in the year 6915</i><i> <I>[<i>1407</i>]</I>.</i> The Nicholas mentioned here may well be the Nicholas Eudaimonoioannes who acted as Manuel II's ambassador to the Venetians in 1416 and was one of his delegates to the Council of Constantine in 1414-17. 

The Eudaimonoioannes family held an important place in the history of the Morea (the Peloponnese), as archons of Monemvasia from the 13th century until the Turkish conquest.

The fabric shows the influence of the Far Eastern, and particularly Japanese styles.

The sash is made of silk which was widely used in Tunisian workshops but would have been imported in its raw form and then carded and spun by women before being dyed by specialist craftsmen. 

One of the recurring motifs that can be seen on this sash is hands. Depictions of hands and other designs containing five elements were believed to counteract the effects of the ‘evil eye’.  The idea of the ‘evil eye’ is common across the Mediterranean and centres on the idea that a jealous look can bring bad luck, ill health or even death.

"The high waistline and narrow sleeves, open at the front seam, are characteristic of women's waistcoats of the early 1620s.  The blackwork embroidery is of exquisite quality and is worked in a continuous pattern throughout the body of the garment.  A group of interlocking curling stems enhanced with a garden of roses, rosebuds, peapods, oak leaves, acorns, pansy and pomegranates, with wasps, butterflies and birds, make up the embroidery design.  The extremely fine speckling stitches create the shaded effect of a woodblock print.  This style of blackwork is typical of the early seventeenth-century and thought to have been inspired by the designs from woodblock prints that the embroiderers were using.  The waistcoat is unlined and embellished with an insertion of bobbin lace in black and white linen at the back of each sleeve, and a edging of bobbin lace in the same colours.",'animal_fibre'

"Sight and touch are the senses most associated with dress - we are beguiled by the colours, shapes, textures and movement of what is worn. We seldom need our sense of hearing to observe dress, except perhaps to catch the creak of leather or the rustle of silk. But the purely decorative buttons on this sombre waistcoat are truly musical. Individually they are silent, but placed together they jostle with their neighbour and tinkle and clang like alpine cowbells. Silent, stealthy movement is impossible. Each button’s smooth, rounded underside contrasts sharply with the dull coils and chains of wire that cover its top and that encase small shiny beads. The light that glints from the beads appears to be absorbed by the fine black felt from which the waistcoat is made.",'animal_fibre'

This beautifully presented programme was produced for a Special Grand Concert in a series of promenade concerts at the Theatre Royal Covent Garden, mounted by its lessee Mr. William Freeman Thomas, 29th November 1883. 

The evening included both light, operatic and classical music by the composers Gioachino Rossini, Georges Bizet, George Frederic Handel, Giacomo Meyerbeer, Léo Delibes, John Liptrot Hatton, Charles Gounoud, Joseph Haydn, John Braham, Amilcare Ponchielli, Franz Schubert, Charles Dibdin, Wilhelm Taubert, Claribel (Charlotte Barnard), Ambrose Thomas, Frederic Hymen Cowen, Louis Antoine Jullien and Giuseppe Verdi. Songs were sung by Charles Santley, Madame Lemmens-Sherrington, Sims Reeves, and Miss Damian, and included Dibdin's 1841 song <i>Tom Bowling, </i>sung at the Henry Wood promenade concerts today.

The orchestra and band of the Coldstream Guards played, and the principal conductor was Arthur Gwyllym Crowe (1825-1894). Other musicians named on the programme were the cellist Edward Howell, the flautist Mr. W.L. Barrett, and the oboist Mr. H. Smith",'animal_fibre'

"Fashionable men and women displayed their taste in the fine fabrics they chose for their clothes. Until the later 17th century most silks were imported. But a silk-weaving industry developed in England, centred around Spitalfields in London, which grew increasingly successful between 1700 and 1760. Huguenot refugee families, contributing technical and business skills, played an integral part in its development.

Spitalfields weavers produced plain and patterned fabrics. Designs changed season by season, influenced by French fashions but developing a distinctive English style. 

This fabric, woven in Spitalfields, is a brocaded silk, and was intended for ladies' gowns. The technique of brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into the pattern of a fabric in specific, sometimes very small areas. It was a more laborious process for the weaver than using patterning wefts running from selvedge to selvedge, but the resulting effect could be much more varied and lively.",'animal_fibre'
"This decorative gold and silver fringe was made for embellishing dress or textiles. It was presented by the Nizam of Hyderabad to the Paris International Exhibition of 1855 as an example of the productions of the region. To make  tinsel, bars of silver or silver gilded with gold leaf were drawn through increasingly small  holes in iron plates in a process called wire-drawing. Once the desired thiness of the wire was achieved, it could be hammered flat to create long strips of tinsel. The tinsel could be used flat, or wrapped around a silk core to make metal-wrapped thread (zari).  This strip of fringe was made by plaiting tinsel into a band of green and silver-gilt-wrapped silk thread.",'animal_fibre'

This theatre programme with its decorative panels and lithographic images of the theatre and the owner H.E. Moss, was made to be folded in three like a paper programme, but was in silk to commemorate the opening night of The Palace Theatre Hull, on 6th December 1897.

Later the group became known as the Moss Empires Variety Theatres, and at its peak comprised thirty-three theatres, the largest chain known in the world. 

Designed by the prolific theatre architect Frank Matcham, the Palace was a sumptuous theatre featuring electric light and a sliding roof over the auditorium which seated 1,800.  By 1897 over 40 theatres in Great Britain had been built to Matcham's designs, and in 1897 alone Matcham-designed theatres opened in Stoke Newington, Crouch End, Dublin, Hull, Nottingham, Aberdeen, Glasgow and London's Edgware Road.  The Palace Theatre was enlarged in 1928 and closed in 1929, reopened in 1951, and renamed the Continental Palace in 1957.

"This coif was once worked in blackwork, a style of needlework popular in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.  It was worked with a single colour of silk, usually black, but also blue, green or red, on linen.   Now only a few tiny shreds of the black silk embroidery thread remain.  The use of iron in the dyeing process (to fix and enhance the black) and exposure to light have caused the threads to disintegrate.  

The loss of thread has exposed the original embroidery design, hand-drawn in blue ink.  The pattern consists of a variety of single motifs of flowers, birds and insects, very similar to those reproduced in embroidery pattern books of the early 17th century.  These motifs were transferred to the linen by pricking the outline of the design on paper, pouncing (dusting with fine dark powder), then joining the dots left on the linen with a fine brush and ink.",'animal_fibre'

Morris revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and in his own home he set up looms for tapestry weaving and the hand knotting of carpets.

Morris & Co. was founded by William Morris in 1875, producing textiles commercially for sale in two London shops. Alexander Morton established his textile company in Scotland in 1867 and manufactured silk and wool fabrics and gauzes for Morris & Co. until Morris set up his Merton Abbey Works in 1881, where he produced his own textiles.

"This repeating pattern of flowers and vegetation was designed by William Morris in 1879 and woven by Alexander Morton & Company for Morris and Company. Morris was the artist and designer who was the greatest single influence on the Arts and Crafts movement and the most successful textile designer and manufacturer of his day. Morris revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and in his own home he set up looms for tapestry weaving and the hand knotting of carpets. He was highly influenced by historical patterns and was one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of the late 19th century.

Morris & Co. was founded by William Morris in 1875, producing textiles commercially for sale in two London shops. Alexander Morton established his textile company in Scotland in 1867 and manufactured silk and wool fabrics and gauzes for Morris & Co. until Morris set up his Merton Abbey Works in 1881, where he produced his own textiles.

This complex design was suitable for curtains and hangings and was available in different scales and colourings.",'animal_fibre'
"Probably produced in Milan in the late 15th or early 16th century, this velvet has a pattern that can be identified as the <i>sempervivum tectorum</i>, a perennial plant that thrives in barren and mountainous places. Francesco Sforza (1401-66) adopted it as his heraldic device along with the motto <i>Mit Zeit</i> (with time). He may have been referring to his endurance and perseverance in obtaining his political position. During his reign (1450-66) the plant was represented only by the large central flower, isolated from stems and leaves and repeated across the width of the fabric three times. The motif evolved over the following twenty years into a more naturalistic version, such as is seen on this velvet.

This pattern on an even richer, gold brocaded velvet is represented on the stomacher and sleeve of a gown worn by Bianca Maria Sforza in a potrait by De Predis. This portrait was made to commemorate her marriage to Maximilian of Austria in 1493. In this context, the pattern probably referred directly to the dynasty from which she came.",'animal_fibre'

"This is a dress silk made by Winkworth, Proctor & Co., a Macclesfield weaving company. By the mid-19th century Macclesfield, near Manchester was one of the key British centres for the production and distribution of woven dress silks.

This example was exhibited in the Great Exhibition as part of a display dedicated to 'Fancy silks, as Shot, Figured, Embroidered, &c;'. A collection of textiles and fabrics from the Exhibition was presented to Her Majesty's Commissioners, and then to the Victoria & Albert Museum to act as a lasting memorial of the 1851 Exhibition. These textiles show the state of industry in 1851. In 1857, when they were exhibited at the Museum, the catalogue described them as providing  'a view both to technical instruction and to the ever-changing and increasing wants of trade in this great commercial country'. This emphasised the need of British manufacturers to produce high quality, desirable goods which would ensure success in the international market.",'animal_fibre'

"This striking brocaded silk was designed to be made up into one of the wide-skirted gowns of the 1740s.  Bold patterns of this kind were overtly fashionable, and as such were more likely to date quickly than simple sprigged silks. The golden scrolls and cartouches are Rococo in style, and show the powerful influence of French silk design upon the manufacture of silks in London.   

Although laborious, the technique of brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into a design in very specific areas, without the wastage of full-width coloured weft threads.

Styles in furnishing textiles changed more slowly than those for fashionable dress, and this pattern was chosen for other grand furnishing schemes well into the 18th century.

The earliest samplers were reference works for embroiderers. They showed 'samples' of patterns and stitches and recorded how to achieve particular effects.  In Europe in the 17th century samplers provided instruction and practice for girls learning needlework.  This sampler and its pair (Museum no.T.97-1939) were made by two English sisters. They used their imagination to make creative examples that are full of personality at a time when many samplers were simply standard undemanding exercises.,'animal_fibre'

"When this bonnet was made, braided straw for the hat trade in the United Kingdom was often the product of child labour.  In a report to the Children's Employment Commission in 1842, one contributor, Major J G Burns noted that in areas where it was concentrated, such as Luton and Bedford, straw braiding could be an absolute bar to a child getting any education at all, ""because children as young as three can learn the craft, and their parents are hard to convince that paying for their schooling is necessary when they can earn a living instead"".  Young children were in any case preferred by some employers as being not only cheaper to employ, but sometimes easier to teach handwork techniques to since their fingers were more pliant.

The evidence submitted to the Children's Employment Commission was gathered by asking the children and some adults (in some cases those whose children worked in the same place as they did themselves) a standard set of questions; they afterwards signed their name, or made their mark if unable to sign. Many of the children had received some education: typically they could read but either couldn't write, or couldn't write fluently; occasionally (but much more rarely) they could write but not read, which in some cases may have been indicative of undetected problems with eyesight or health.",'animal_fibre'

"In England and elsewhere in Europe in the 17th century, samplers had developed from personal reference works for embroiderers  into a method of instruction and practice for girls learning needlework. This sampler was worked in a needle lace stitch called hollie point, most examples of which date from the second quarter of the 18th century. Hollie point was a practical stitch to learn, used particularly for decorative insertions into baby clothes and occasionally adult garments. Exact counterparts of the patterns worked in hollie-point samplers can be found in surviving clothing.",'animal_fibre'
"This tapestry probably belonged to a set of sixteen, though some are now untraceable. The subject is Venus admonishing Cupid, from the story of Cupid and Psyche, as related by the Latin author Lucius Apuleius in the <i>Golden Ass</i>. The V&A has two other tapestries from the set: <i>Venus seeking vengeance on Psyche</i> and <i> Psyche's Punishment in Venus's Service</i>. The story was a favourite pictorial theme during the Renaissance.

The tapestry shows Venus reproaching her son, Cupid, for his affair with Psyche. The Goddess is seen entering from the left gesturing forcefully in an accusatory fashion, her billowing drapery accentuating the dynamism of her pose. In contrast, Cupid reclines on a bed with a chastised expression, his hand over his heart and his bow and quiver laid aside. 

The design for this tapestry, executed by Giovanni Battista Castello (1509-1569), and in the National Galleries of Scotland, shows Venus in a greater state of undress, indicating that when the tapestry came to be woven, the composition was altered to allow an extra fold of fabric to cover her form, resulting in a more modest display.",'animal_fibre'

"W. S. Gilbert based <i>Pygmalion and Galatea</i> on Ovid's tale of a sculptor who falls in love with a statue. It was first performed at the Haymarket on 9th December 1871, with a New York opening on 1st October 1872.

This silk programme was produced for the Lyceum Theatre's revival begun on 8th December 1883, starring the New York revival's lead actress Mary Anderson in the role of Galatea. It was paired with the especially-written one act play <i>Comedy and Tragedy,</i> which was added to the bill on 26th January 1884. The run closed on 5th April to allow Anderson to tour Britain, with the productions resuming at the Lyceum on 6th September 1884. The plays closed on 25th October.

This was Anderson's first British season and it established her celebrity in the British Isles. Reviews of the production praised her beauty but were critical of her performance. A review from The Times from 8th September 1884 states: 'So far as a first night audience could furnish a test of popularity, there appeared to be no falling-off in the actress's physical attractiveness, which has always been and must apparently continue to be the principal element in her success. In some respects her rendering of both parts [in <i>Pygmalion and Galatea</i> and <i>Comedy and Tragedy</i>] has improved, though her performance, artistically considered, is still by no means remarkable or exceptional.'",'animal_fibre'
"Silk and satin theatre programmes were frequently produced in the 18th and 19th centuries to commemorate special theatrical and musical events, the less expensive ones with integral fringing made from fraying cut edges, and the more expensive with separately applied silk or metallic fringes. This beautifully presented programme was produced for a Benefit Concert on 2nd November 1885, the last night of a series of promenade concerts at the Theatre Royal Covent Garden. The beneficiary was its lessee Mr. William Freeman Thomas. As usual for Benefit performances, he would have taken a percentage of the takings, and would have been have been involved in the choice of the evening's programme.

The concert included both light, operatic and classical music by the composers Giuseppe Verdi, Gioachino Rossini, Charles Gounoud, Edward Henry Thorne, Theo Marzials, Leo Délibes, Frederic Cowen, De Beriot, August Röckel, Lady Arthur Hill, Joseph Haydn, Arthur Gwyllym Crowe, Luigi Arditi, Arthur Sullivan, John Braham, Louis-Antoine Jullien, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Louis Diehl and Carl Latann. It was sung by Clara Samuell, Rose Hersee, Alwina Valleria, Joseph Maas, Signor Foli, Howard Reynolds, Madame Enriquez and Ada Patterson.

The bands and fifers of the Coldstream Guards and the Middlesex Yeomanry played under the supervision of their bandmasters C. Thomas and Mr. Graves. The rest of the music was conducted by Arthur Gwyllym Crowe (1825-1894), also a composer, especially of walzes, including Gwyllym Crowe's new vocal waltz <i>Fairie Voices</i> that opened the second half of this concert, sung by Mr. Stedman's choir of boys and girls, which <i>The Musical Standard</i> for 1885 noted, comprised sixty voices.",'animal_fibre'

Some women purchased patterns and embroidered slippers for themselves or their husbands.  

Here silk braids have been stitched to the black woollen 'upper' in the shape of flowers, leaves and scrolls.  The process of attaching one material to another in this way is called appliqué.

"The Devonshire House ball was the highlight of the London season of 1897, which focused on celebrations for Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee.  The ball was remarkably well publicised and documented as many of the royal and aristocratic guests were photographed in their lavish costumes for a privately published album.  The event has come to represent the pinnacle of the extravagant aristocratic pastime of fancy dress balls and it exhibited the extraordinary confidence of the aristocracy and the British Empire at the time, providing a contrast with decline and social changes of the 20th century, symbolised by the demolition of Devonshire House in 1924.

The costumes required for fashionable fancy dress balls in the 19th century were a significant source of business for women's dressmakers, while men seemed to hire their costumes from costumiers such as Nathan's.  This example, worn by the Hon. Francis Gathorne-Hardy, is a rare survival, as costumes were naturally re-used and adapted. Fancy dress balls were an opportunity for men to wear flamboyant clothes inspired by the past, contrasting with the sober tailoring worn for everyday dress in the nineteenth century.

The costumes have remained in the same family since they were made. The Hon. Francis Gathorne-Hardy married Lady Isobel Stanley in 1898. He had a long and highly decorated military career, serving in the Boer War and the First World War. When he left the army his full title was General Sir John Francis Gathorne-Hardy GCB, GCVO, CMG, DSO. Lady Isobel Stanley was the daughter of the Earl of Derby, Lord Stanley of Preston, who was Governor-General of Canada.

"This woven silk furnishing fabric entitled 'Kennet' was designed by William Morris and registered on October 18th, 1883. It was possibly woven for Morris & Co. by the Macclesfield, England textile firm J. O. Nicholson. The meandering stems, acanthus leaves and flower heads on a ground of smaller scale leaves and vines is typical of Morris's designs. These were usually in muted or natural colours due to the use of vegetable rather than synthetic dyes. Reacting against the naturalistic, hothouse blooms which often decorated mid-Victorian chintzes, Morris based his patterns on a simplified, stylised version of British garden flowers, a trend continued by many Arts and Crafts designers who followed him.

Morris was the artist and designer who was the greatest single influence on the Arts and Crafts movement and the most successful textile designer and manufacturer of his day.  Morris revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and in his own home he set up looms for tapestry weaving and the hand knotting of carpets. He was highly influenced by historical patterns and was one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of the late 19th century. Morris & Co. was founded by William Morris in 1875, producing textiles commercially for sale in two London shops.",'animal_fibre'

"From the 17th century, Paris led European taste in fashionable dress and furnishings, and the weavers of Lyon provided the silks needed to maintain this position. The International Exhibitions of the 19th century gave manufacturers the opportunity to display their technical skills to the rest of the world, and at the Great Exhibition of 1851 the 31 exhibitors from Lyon confirmed the supreme quality of their silks above those of their competitors in London.

This length of dress fabric was purchased by the South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria and Albert Museum) at the Paris Exhibition of 1855 for £4. The fashionable silhouette of the 1850s required several metres of fabric to create wide bell-shaped skirts, and this costly material represents the very height of luxury in dress.",'animal_fibre'

"Embroidered wall hanging worked in silks on a background of green woven silk damask. The hanging has wide borders (16 inches or 40.5 cm) to left and right.

The central motif shows an orange tree around which winds a red acanthus leaf on which perch two pigeons. Two smaller flowering trees are seen in the foreground, the various dispersed bunches of the growing flowers include tulips, bluebells and forget-me-nots. Subsidiary trailing plants include roses, a thistle and others with large-headed exotic blooms.

Worked mostly in darning stitch with stem stitch used as outlines on some blooms. Buttonhole filling, laid and couched work, satin stitches and French knots are also used. The birds are worked through an additional backing cotton.

There is a strip of tape with rings at the top of the hanging which was originally turned under. Originally nailed to a stretcher, the embroidery still shows nail-holes around the edge. Unlined.

The ground fabric is a William Morris pattern called 'The Oak'.",'animal_fibre'

"Jennens & Bettridge, whose name is stamped on this work basket, were one of the largest and most prominent firms of papier-mâché manufacturers in Birmingham. In 1815 Theodore Hyla Jennens and John Bettridge took over an existing factory at 99, Constitution Hill and subsequently opened a London showroom at 6 Halkin Street West, Belgrave Square. The firm produced a wide range of papier-mâché goods ranging in size and complexity from small trays and boxes to large pieces of furniture such as beds and pianos, some of which were displayed in their stand at the Great Exhibition of 1851. 

This work basket is typical of the small domestic products made of papier-mâché. It was made in sections by placing layers of paper, pasted on both sides, over moulds of the right shape. This part of the work was usually carried out by women and girls. After the box had been dried in a stove, oiled and dried again,  a cabinet-maker was responsible for removing the parts of the box from the moulds, assembling it, and for any necessary planing, filing or smoothing, before the layers of black and clear varnish, painted decoration and gilding were added in the paint shop. Before and after each layer of varnish or decoration the work basket was stove dried. Fittings, like the handle, were added, before the box was given a final polish.",'animal_fibre'

"Silk and satin theatre programmes were frequently produced in the 18th and 19th centuries to commemorate special theatrical and musical events, the less expensive ones with integral fringing made from fraying cut edges, and the more expensive with separately applied silk or metallic fringes. This programme was produced for a performance by 'The Original No. 1 Pepper's Ghost and Spectral Opera Company' that specialised in plays that included the stage effect known as Pepper's Ghost, because it was developed by John Henry Pepper as a theatrical effect after seeing a demonstration of 'the Dircksian Phantasmagoria' in 1862 by its inventor Henry Dircks at London's Royal Polytechnic Institute. Strong light cast on a performer under the stage cast ghostly images of actors on stage, with the use of an angled mirror. Other companies used the technique, including 'Northcote's Pepper's Ghost and Spectral Opera Company' that toured plays including <i>A Christmas Caro</i>l and <i>The Haunted House.</i>

The plays that the Original No. 1 Pepper's Ghost and Spectral Operas Company performed at the Mechanics' Hall in Forres on the 19th June 1896 were 'the powerful slave drama' <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin, </i>and 'the laughable spectral farce' <i>PPP, or, the Poor Poet's Plagues</i>. The following evening it was <i>The Corsican Brothers</i>. The performance on the 19th June included a concert, and was advertised as being under the patronage of Sir W. and Lady Gordon-Cumming and 'the Elite of Forres and Neighbourhood'. Sir William Gordon-Cumming (1848-1930), a local landowner and former friend of Edward, Prince of Wales, was considered a social outcast in London by 1896 but still liked locally. His wife was the American heiress Florence Garner, and the production of the silk programme indicates that they attended the performance. Gordon-Cumming was born near Forres, in the north of Scotland, on the Moray coast, near Kinloss. The sole proprietor, presumably of the Company, is given as Mr. Albert Drake.",'animal_fibre'

"<b>Object Type</b>
Caskets and workboxes were made and used by girls in the 17th century. The girls would decorate small panels with embroidery which would then be sent to a cabinet-maker to be made up into a box. They were often fitted with compartments for sewing and writing as well as a small mirror. Many cabinets also had secret compartments, used to store personal possessions such as jewellery or letters. The high cost of the materials, as well as the skill needed to create these boxes, means they could only have been made in wealthy households.

<b>People</b>
The panels were worked by young girls, aged around 11 or 12, as part of their education. Girls started learning needlework skills aged 6 or 7, first creating a band sampler (see T.433-1990) and then moving on to more complex pieces such as cutwork. Embroidering the panels of a casket or for a mirror (see T.17-1955) appears to have been one of the last stages of a girl’s needlework education. These skills would be useful later in life in the management of a household.

<b>Materials & Designs</b>
Biblical, mythological and classical scenes were all popular themes for decorating caskets. The top of this casket is decorated with a lady holding a basket of fruit and a tulip, possibly the personification of Taste or Smell, both of whom were popular subjects for embroidery.",'animal_fibre'
"This is a detail of a silk garment, woven on a hand-loom in Mandalay Palace.  The bands of undulating rope design, filled with floral and leaf patterns in a range of stunning colours on a red ground, exemplifies the renowned and uniquely Burmese textile known as <i>acheik-luntaya</i>. This garment would have been worn by a lady of the court either as a <i>tabet</i> (stole) or a <i>yinzi</i> (breast cloth), forming an ensemble when worn with a wrap skirt known in Burma as an <i>hta-mein</i> and jacket known as an <i>ein-gyi</i>.

The garment dates from the reign of King Thibaw (r. 1878-1885), the last ruler of the Konbaung dynasty. It was found in the apartment of Queen Supayalat, the chief queen of King Thibaw, by the donor's husband, Colonel Pollard, who was a member of the British force that annexed upper Burma in 1885.",'animal_fibre'

"Nô is the classical theatre of Japan which was codified in the 14th century by the father and son actors Kan'ami and Zeami under the patronage of the Shogun (supreme military leader) Ashikaga Yoshimitsu. Under Yoshimitsu the Zen principles of restraint, understatement, economy of movement and frugality of expression became incorporated into the performance. By the early seventeenth century Noh had become an even more austere and formalised drama reserved almost exclusively for the Tokugawa family, the ruling military elite.  This type of robe is called <i>karaori</i> means 'Chinese Weave',although the term came to describe the style of robe itself as much as the technique. The karaori is the basic outer robe worn by a Nôh actor in female roles and the predominant red colour of the robe indicates the character of a young woman. The robe is decorated with roundels of chrysanthemums, peonies and irises in coloured silks on a gold thread lattice pattern over a woven red silk ground. It has three layers of simultaneously woven design: the ground, the background geometric pattern and the top pattern of glossy silk that looks almost like embroidery.",'animal_fibre'

The light, summery silk of this dress was called ‘lustring’. The skirts were gathered up with loops, a new fashion referring to country working dress.

The dress was originally constructed as a ‘sack-back’ or negligée, with loose pleats from the shoulders. Dresses were often altered, as fabric was so expensive.

"Opinion about this case for papers has changed more than once since it was acquired by the Museum over a hundred years ago. John Jones, who bought the case in the 19th century and bequeathed it to the Museum in 1882 would have acquired it as a piece dating from the reign of the French king Louis XV (reigned 1715-74).  He had a particular love for French decorative arts of the 18th century and his collection was to become one of the most significant bequests ever made to the Museum. By the 1960s, it was suggested that the case had been made up out of an 18th-century table top, but we now believe that it was made in its entirety only a few years before Jones acquired it.  By the 1830s, the trade in French antiques in London was so important that many makers were actively creating objects in their own interpretation of the Louis XV style.",'animal_fibre'

This gave quite a formal effect to the pattern, but the overall effect could be lightened with delicate drawing of the individual motifs.

"This silk satin evening dress, designed by Charles Frederick Worth, represents the height of couture fashion in the early 1880s. It was worn by Mrs Granville Alexander, a daughter of the U.S. sewing machine pioneer, Isaac Singer. The donor was her great-niece.

The bodice is seamed and gored for a moulded fit. It extends into drapes at the hips and merges with the train, which falls in inverted pleats from the seams of the bodice. The inside of the skirt is hooped at the back, with tapes for adjustment, to create the bustle effect.  The elegant cut, combined with the rich materials and embroidery, makes for a flattering silhouette. 

Worth was a celebrated Parisian couture dressmaker. He was born in 1825 in Bourne, Lincolnshire, and started working at the age of 12 in a draper's shop in London. Eight years later he moved to Paris, where he opened his own premises in 1858. He was soon patronised by the Empress Eugenie and her influence was instrumental to his success.

The rich labour-intensive work shows 18th century French embroidery at its most complex.

The border was probably made in the Sheldon tapestry workshop. In 1570 William Sheldon, a prosperous Worcestershire gentleman, set up a tapestry workshop in his manor house at Barcheston, now in Warwickshire.  His intention was to provide a remedy for the high local unemployment which, by training tapestry weavers, would also cut down the level of goods imported from Flanders (now part of Belgium) and the Netherlands, the traditional areas of the weaving craft. His head weaver almost certainly came from those regions and was engaged to teach his skills to local Englishmen. 

Few of the Sheldon tapestries rivalled  the more sophisticated work produced in Flanders and most of the products attributed to the Sheldon looms are relatively modest in size and style. They were therefore within reach of the middle classes of society. Production continued through the lifetime of William’s son, Ralph, but had almost certainly ceased by 1615.",'animal_fibre'

"This is a dress silk made by Winkworth, Proctor & Co., a Macclesfield weaving company. By the mid-19th century Macclesfield, near Manchester was one of the key British centres for the production and distribution of woven dress silks.

This example was exhibited in the Great Exhibition as part of a display dediciated to 'Fancy silks, as Shot, Figured, Embroidered, &c;'. A collection of textiles and fabrics from the Exhibition was presented to Her Majesty's Commissioners, and then to the Victoria & Albert Museum to act as a lasting memorial of the 1851 Exhibition. These textiles show the state of industry in 1851. In 1857, when they were exhibited at the Museum, the catalogue described them as providing  'a view both to technical instruction and to the ever-changing and increasing wants of trade in this great commercial country'. This emphasised the need of British manufacturers to produce high quality, desirable goods which would ensure success in the international market.",'animal_fibre'

"Silk and satin theatre playbills and programmes were produced from the 18th century onwards, to commemorate special evenings at the theatre. Most theatres in the 19th century would have had some made to mark grand openings or milestone performances. By the end of the First World War however the practice had generally died out, only being revived very occasionally,  more often at London's opera houses than any other theatres.

This playbill was produced for the production of Shakespeare's <i>Macbeth</i> at the Royal Princess's Theatre in London's Oxford Street on 16th March 1863, following its production at Windsor Castle on 4th February. Its format is a copy of the large paper playbills that Charles Kean was producing at the time, detailing costume sources, all the spectacular scene designs as well as the large cast and stage crew. Queen Victoria was fond of theatre and frequently requested private performances at Windsor which Charles Kean staged for her.

"This portrait on silk was produced as a souvenir of the Swedish opera singer Jenny Lind (1820-1887) who took London by storm after her first appearance at Her Majesty's Opera House on 4 May 1847 as Alice in Meyerbeer's opera <i>Robert Il Diavolo</i>. Queen Victoria attended that performance and wrote in her journal that Jenny Lind was: 'absolutely perfection' and 'a complete triumph.' 'She has a most exquisite, powerful, and really quite peculiar voice, so round soft and flexible and her acting is charming and touching and very natural. Her appearance was very ladylike and sweet and though she is not beautiful, she has a fine tall figure, is very graceful, has fine blue eyes and fine fair hair. The storm of applause when she first appeared, and during the singing of her first air, was tremendous. Her singing of 'Quand je quittais la Normandie' was charming and elicited two encores. Her acting throughout was truly touching and heart thrilling. At the conclusion of the Opera Jenny Lind was called before the curtain three times being received with cheers and waving of handkerchiefs.'

Jenny Lind trained in Stockholm and Paris and made her début in 1844 in Berlin, performing in Germany and Austria before making her London début. She became such a phenomenon in London that her portrait was reproduced on all manner of items, from snuff boxes and matchboxes to soap and candle snuffers. The contemporary song' Jenny Lind Mania' celebrated the craze for her, starting: 'Oh! Is there not a pretty fuss, In London all around, About the Swedish Nightingale, The talk of London town, Each square and street as through you pass, Aloud its praises ring, About this pretty singing bird, The famous Jenny Lind.'

This print was engraved from a portrait by the contemporary artist H. Gubbins and produced by George Baxter  (1804-1867) who was granted a patent in 1835 for his 'Baxter Prints', a method of printing to produce coloured steel plate, copper plate and other impressions, mixing intaglio and relief printing processes. His original patent ran for fourteen years, after which it was renewed in 1849 for a further five years.",'animal_fibre'
"Woollen twill tapestry faced with woven and brocaded silk and metal thread bias-cut satin and backed with silk satin.
Warp: dark blue, blue, red, white and yellow wool.  The yellow is used in the centre but its top and bottom have been dyed dark blue to form the dark ground needed for the main border.  The other colours form the stripes for the borders.
Weft: wool; dark blue, blue, light blue, dark green, green, red, light red, yellow, white.
The central panel is 134 cm long and has a yellow ground.  It contains a lobed arch outlined with a white border with a green floral meander with red and green blossoms and yellow details.  Towards the lower end is a shallow tray decorated with a floral pattern in white, red, green and yellow; this supports a white vase decorated with flowers.  To either side is a smaller vase with a single carnation fan in red, dark blue, light blue and yellow.  The central vase holds a single  large rosette and two cascading stems of small blossoms.  In the upper central field there is a smaller tray with a small vase from which emerges a fat bifurcated leaf with a white ground filled with a multi-flowering stem.  Below the apex of the arch is a large carnation.  The rest of the ground is densely packed with fairly large flowers, leaves etc..  These include irises, carnations and buds.  The lower corner of the central panel have quarter medallions outlined in white with a red ground and similar floral patterns.  Above these, along the sides of the arch is a half cypress tree with a yellow ground and green outline.  The spandrels have a red ground densely packed with floral motifs similar to the main field, mainly in blue and green.
Main border: dark green ground with large inward facing red carnation fans alternating with sprays of blue irises and sprays of red flowers and with a smaller red and white rosette.
Inner and outer borders: white ground with a green meander and red or deep yellow blossoms.  Down the sides the ground is white but along the top and bottom the ground appears to be light blue because of the change in the colour of the warp threads.
Note: this is a wonderful piece of both design and weaving.
Facing: bias-cut silk satin; striped; [1] white ground with an isolated floral sprig with a dark brown flower and a pair of green leaves, alternating with a larger boteh-shaped motif like a bunch of grapes in light brown and metal thread with green leaves.  [2] light brown ground with a similar small sprig in pink alternating with a large sprig of three pink flowers, metal thread and green leaves.  These stripes are separated by a narrow composite stripe of yellow, dark brown and yellow.
Warp: white, dark brown, yellow and light brown silk, Z-twist
Weft: green, pink and dark brown silk.  
Metal thread: silver stripe open S-wound on yellow silk.

The metal threads woven in create the scalloping edge at intervals down the edge. Green and coral are used to create a pattern that is reversible, green, silver and gold on one side, coral, silver and gold on the other. The pattern motif is created using warp threads in the colours.

The painting, which comes from a set of religious images used in the ""water and land"" ritual—a Buddhist ceremony conducted for the salvation of ""all the souls on land and sea""—is distinguished by its high level of craftsmanship, intricate detail, and lavish use of precious mineral pigments. An inscription at the lower right, 'Respectfully commissioned by the imperial prince Zhuang', attests to the fact that the painting was the product of the imperial workshop.

"This repeating pattern of flowers and vegetation was designed by William Morris in 1879 and woven by Alexander Morton & Company for Morris and Company. Morris was the artist and designer who was the greatest single influence on the Arts and Crafts movement and the most successful textile designer and manufacturer of his day. Morris revived the craft of block printing and vegetable dyeing and in his own home he set up looms for tapestry weaving and the hand knotting of carpets. He was highly influenced by historical patterns and was one of the most knowledgeable textile historians of the late 19th century.

Morris & Co. was founded by William Morris in 1875, producing textiles commercially for sale in two London shops. Alexander Morton established his textile company in Scotland in 1867 and manufactured silk and wool fabrics and gauzes for Morris & Co. until Morris set up his Merton Abbey Works in 1881, where he produced his own textiles.

"This coif is a fine example of blackwork, a style of needlework popular in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.  It was worked with a single colour of silk, usually black, but also blue, green or red, on linen.  The motifs in the shape of leaves, flowers and insects are filled with counted-thread stitches arranged to create repeating geometric designs.  This style of blackwork is characteristic of the 16th century.  

Until the end of the 17th century the coif was informal headwear for women.  Plain linen versions were worn by the working-class.  Middle-class and aristocratic women wore elaborately decorated coifs.  It would have been worn by itself indoors, or with a hat on top in public. In Western Europe it was customary for both men and women to cover their heads in public up until the 1960s. A hat was an essential part of respectable dress and, from a health perspective, head coverings were considered necessary to protect against chills and disease.",'animal_fibre'
"Fashionable men and women displayed their taste in the fine fabrics they chose for their clothes. Until the later 17th century most silks were imported. But a silk-weaving industry developed in England, centred around Spitalfields in London, which grew increasingly successful between 1700 and 1760. Huguenot refugee families, contributing technical and business skills, played an integral part in its development.

Spitalfields weavers produced plain and patterned fabrics. Designs changed season by season, influenced by French fashions but developing a distinctive English style. 

This fabric, woven in Spitalfields, is a brocaded silk satin, and was intended for ladies' gowns. The technique of brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into the pattern of a fabric in specific, sometimes very small areas. It was a more laborious process for the weaver than using patterning wefts running from selvedge to selvedge, but the resulting effect could be much more varied and lively.",'animal_fibre'

"The elegant flat satin lady's slipper first became popular during the last decade of the eighteenth century.  Its plain design was part of the movement in fashion away from what were considered by some to be the extravagant excesses of the late eighteenth century.  The move was towards a simpler, purer style of dress and footwear that was influenced by designs from classical antiquity. 

Slippers or 'sandle shoes', continued to be worn well into the mid-century although by the 1850s they were used mainly for formal wear in black or white.  This pair of shoes is a typical example of that style.  The thin leather sole and delicately hand-stitched satin uppers were relatively simple and cheap to produce.  They could then be customised either by the retailer or the owner with rosettes, ribbon ankle ties or other decorative embellishments.",'animal_fibre'

"In the early 19th century gloves were an indispensible accessory for women. They were worn for day and evening wear. Wealthy women owned many pairs suited to different occasions and carefully chosen to match particular outfits. Strict rules applied to the wearing of gloves. A woman would be considered undressed if she left the house ungloved and it was customary, for instance, to keep gloves on in church, at the theatre and at balls but to remove them before dining. Gloves soon became soiled, and dirty or worn gloves were a sign of slovenliness and poverty. While the wealthy might only wear a pair of pale coloured gloves once, most women had to devote time and effort to cleaning and repairing their gloves. The difficulties they encountered are reflected in the frequent advice given on glove care in contemporary women's magazines and household manuals.

The bright yellow elbow-length evening glove shown in this image was hand-sewn with minute stitches using white silk thread. The same thread was used for a double line of decorative stitching around the base of the thumb and to work the double lines of stitching  for the long 'points' on the back of the glove. Yellow was a very fashionable colour for gloves at the begining of the 19th century. The leather of this glove is extremely fine and supple and would easily have stretched to allow for the glove to be put on and carefully eased onto the fingers and up the arm.",'animal_fibre'

Jones trained as an architect and travelled to the Middle East where he made a study of decorative art. In 1856 he published the <i>Grammar of Ornament</i>, analysing patterns and colours from many periods and cultures and the book became an invaluable source for many designers. 

Jones believed that reproducing flowers and similar objects in a naturalistic way was in bad taste. He preferred to create stylised motifs and designed a range of high quality silks using this type of pattern for leading manufacturers like Warner, Sillett & Ramm. This design, entitled 'Sultan', is inspired by stylised Asian flower designs.",'animal_fibre'

"The parasol was a popular accessory during the 19th and early 20th century, a period when sun tanned skin was highly undesirable. It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances.

The high quality ivory carving and fine silk on this folding carriage parasol suggests that the black lace adornment is genuine handmade Chantily lace as opposed to the extremely good imitations found on many parasols of this time. The small size of carriage parasols meant that manufacturers could use the very best in labour and materials, making them key in displays of wealth and taste. The Royal Victoria parasol displayed at the 1851 Great Exhibition had a lining of pink moiré silk starting a trend for shocking pink linings such as in this example. This bright flash of colour would have been revealed when the shade was held over the shoulder.",'animal_fibre'

The same decoration is found on many other kinds of jewellery from northern Italy.

In the 19th century Italian women usually used silk ribbons to fasten their necklaces and pendants, but these ribbons were fragile and easily destroyed.  The ones shown here are rare survivals, saved by the V&A's early interest in authenticity.

"This silk textile has a design that was traditionally used for tomb covers. The religious inscriptions are worked in white, mustard-yellow and crimson and arranged in a zigzag pattern on a green ground. The texts on the wider bands alternate. The denser text within each V-shape of the zigzag quotes the Muslim creed, or statement of belief. This states, 'There is no god but God. Muhammad is the messenger of God'. A looser pattern is made up of the word Allah ('God') placed above the name Muhammad. This is repeated at each angle of the zigzag. The inscriptions that make up the narrower bands vary. They may be one of three quotations from the Qu'ran relating to the Prophet (XXXIII, 56; XXXIII, 40; IX, 33).

"Fashionable embroideries of the late 18th century were usually worked to create a very smooth, flat appearance, alleviated in this instance by the use of applied net and by small amounts of chenille thread (in the W-shapes which form part of the ground pattern).  French embroidered waistcoats were very popular in England and the Exchequer Records in the Public Records Office refer to many instances of French waistcoat panels being smuggled across the Channel to avoid paying duty.  Embroiderers in Britain also worked waistcoat shapes in similar designs.

Waistcoat panels were embroidered to shape; the areas of undecorated silk allowed the waistcoat to be cut and fitted to whatever size was required.  In this panel the pocket flap was embroidered in the upper right hand corner and was then cut out, hemmed and stitched into place.",'animal_fibre'

"This embroidered silk wall panel was the first Chinese textile to be registered in the V&A's collection. 

Despite the seemingly conventional Chinese landscape and motifs in the embroidery, it is probably that this textile was made for an export market. The embroidery is in the style of Cantonese work made for export. The colour scheme is also more typical of those favoured by a European market in the eighteenth and nineteenth century (the pink, vermillion and pastel blue hues would have been a more vibrant shade of reds and blues when new). Finally, there would have been very little use in a Chinese interior for a wall hanging such as this example, while on the other hand, the dimensions of this panel hanging suggests that it might have been made to fit the floor to ceiling height of a European home.",'animal_fibre'
"The exact purpose of these two embroidered panels is not clear.  Each has loops around three sides for fastening to something.

However, other sleeve panels are ovoid shape to fill a similar shape opening in the sleeve.  Nor is it clear how and to what the loops on three sides would fasten.  

The date of the embroidery appears earlier than the 1620s.  The simple speckling corresponds to the period 1590 to 1610 during the transition from the geometrical patterns of the 16th century to the shaded speckling of the 17th century.  The sleeves of this period were very full at the shoulder tapering to a narrow wrist, with the seams closed.  So it is not clear how these panels would have been used in the fashions of 1590 to 1610.",'animal_fibre'

"In an age of oak furniture, when benches and stools were more common than chairs, cushions played an important part in the furnishing of  British country houses. Numerous examples are listed in contemporary inventories. They were either tapestry woven, as here, or embroidered in sturdy wool canvaswork. In the case of more delicate examples made of luxury silks and velvets, they were sometimes worked with metal thread. In the tapestry-weaving technique the supporting threads (warp threads), usually made of linen or wool, are stretched and fixed onto a loom. The weaver creates a pattern using coloured threads (weft threads), often wool but sometimes silk or even gold or silver. These are wrapped around a hand-held shuttle and passed over and under alternate warps for the area over which a particular colour is required. Another colour is then taken up so that the pattern is gradually developed. 

Tapestry was fairly hard-wearing and thus quite utilitarian, although the best examples, such as the present piece, were beautifully decorated with narratives and other favoured motifs. Cushion covers were either square or long for benches. 

The scene shown is the Flight into Egypt, the episode from the life of Jesus Christ when his parents took him to Egypt to escape the wrath of King Herod, who intended to have all boys under the age of two killed. The Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus are shown on a donkey, while Joseph is seen to the right, leading the donkey and carrying his carpenter's tools. The top and lower borders contain hunting scenes and each corner has fashionably dressed figures of two men and two women, perhaps indicating the type of clients who might use the cushion.",'animal_fibre'
Quilted petticoats were worn by women in the 18th century until about 1790.

"The side seams of this robe barely extend below the hips. From that point downwards the back and the front panels are separate, revealing the trousers that would have been worn underneath.

The silk used for the robe was woven with a fine black floral stripe at wide intervals, and a meandering floral stem has been embroidered in the intervening spaces. This pattern was first printed on the ground fabric with dark ink, which can be seen clearly in several places, and was then embroidered using a tambour hook. The completed length of woven and embroidered silk was then cut into the appropriate pieces for the robe. It has been edged with a metal braid.

Tambour work is only possible if the fabric is held very tightly in a frame. It takes it name from the French word for a drum, because many of the early tambour frames were drum-shaped, and is a quick method of covering the ground with a fine chain-stitch.",'animal_fibre'

It was worked with a single colour of silk, usually black, but also blue, green or red, on linen.

Until the end of the 17th century the coif was informal headwear for women.  Plain linen versions were worn by the working-class.  Middle-class and aristocratic women wore elaborately decorated coifs.  It would have been worn by itself indoors, or with a hat on top in public.

"Patchwork is a needlework technique where small pieces of cut out fabric shapes are sewn together to produce a decorative design. The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. A pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut out. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. A bedcover that has been pieced but not wadded is often referred to as a coverlet.

The complex, double-sided design of this coverlet would have been pieced over paper when it was first created. At some point in the nineteenth century, repairs have been made to some of the more fragile silks and silk velvets. It was probably at this point that whole sheets of newspaper were used as an interlining, adding strength and stability to the original coverlet.  Paper was handmade until the mid-nineteenth century and was both expensive and extremely useful.  Waste-paper was a valuable household commodity and was often kept over a long period.

Although very little was known about this coverlet when it was acquired in 1937, the papers now visible through the damaged silks provide a record of the household's reading habits. Most are taken from newspapers dating from the 1780s to 1840s, and include trial reports and racing calendars from the Leicestershire area.",'animal_fibre'

"This tapestry is from a series representing twelve of Louis XIV’s royal residences during different months of the year, with the King shown hunting with his retinue in the grounds of his chateaux. The composition puts these outdoor scenes into the background, with the foreground dominated by a display of abundance, both the bounty of nature and the luxury of court life. The textiles and other precious objects laid on the balustrade are known to have been drawn from Louis’ treasury, and the animals and birds from his menagerie. The series was conceived and designed by Le Brun, but many artists collaborated by providing the details in which they specialised, such as floral arrangements.

The first set of<i> Les Maisons Royales </i>was made in the workshop of Lefebvre and Jans in 1668. Between then and 1713 the Crown commissioned seven complete sets of this popular subject, woven with gold thread. A number of other less lavish sets were commissioned by private individuals.

"The impetus to form a collection of Persian textiles in South Kensington was generated by the fear that modernization might weaken Iran's artistic traditions. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the building of an international telegraph system, the introduction of steam navigation on the Caspian Sea and improved transportation within Iran opened the country to foreign merchants who negotiated trade treaties which were seldom favourable to their hosts.  Imported goods, especially textiles, were cheaper than those produced locally. In the 1850s cotton, woollen and silk cloth brought from Britain accounted for 66% of Iran's total imports; in the 1880s this had dropped a little to 63%.  
The competition from cheap imported goods coupled with a change in taste prompted the preference for foreign styles and had a severe effect on Iranian textile production.  Several years of drought and famine, which resulted in as many as 2 million people dying in 1871-72, compounded the problems and many textile crafts almost ceased to exist.

In 1876, to increase the presence of Iranian arts and crafts in London and to encourage the British to buy Iranian goods, the Shah instructed his Minister, Amin al-Mulk, to organise a gift of textiles to the Museum, including this example, which was delivered in March 1877.",'animal_fibre'

"Wall hangings, like large-scale tapestries, were important furnishings in interiors in the Middle Ages and during the Tudor period, providing both insulation and decoration in the coldest and gloomiest places. At a time when even the most important rooms were extremely spartan, colourful wall hangings would have greatly enhanced the space. They were also used to tranform both simple streets or bare churches on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings. They were easily transportable and therefore well suited to the itinerant life-style of courts of the period. 

The market for large tapestries was more or less confined to the nobility, royalty and the Church, while merchants/ middle classes could have afforded hangings of less grandeur such as this one, which might also have been appropriate for a less grand room in a noble mansion. The bold, almost heraldic pattern would have rendered it visible from a distance and together with its relative sturdiness, would have made the textile appropriate as a hanging for draping over a balcony during a procession or even as the cover of a temporary outside structure for some outdoor event or entertainment. Very few early hangings survive because of heavy use: they were exposed to rough handling, being used frequently on a temporary basis, nailed to walls or wooden structures and then taken down. They were also often cut down and altered to fit different rooms.

The technique of appliqué is probably among one of the oldest known embroidery techniques, some examples having been found in tombs from Pazyryk in Siberia, dated to 5th - 3rd century BCE (Rudenko, Sergei I., <i>Frozen tombs of Siberia: the Pazyryk burials of Iron Age horsemen</i> (London: Dent, 1970).",'animal_fibre'

"This superbly crafted Japanese helmet is of the type known as <i>suji-bachi</i> (ridged bowl) and is made from 120 patinated russet iron plates riveted vertically; consequently the helmet is extremely heavy. The inscription inside the helmet reads 'Joshu (modern-day Ibaraki Prefecture) Suifu ju Yoshihide Saku'; the armourer is not recorded, but was likely to be of the Myochin school, one of three main groups of armourers who worked in Joshu province. 

The circular top fitting (<i>tehen no ana</i>) is of <i>shakudo</i>, an alloy of copper and gold which is patinated to a rich blue-black hue. The leading edges of the flexible neck-protector (<i>shikoro</i>) are of fine pierced <i>shakudo</i> with a design of chrysanthemums and backed by gilded copper plates. The sixteenth century warlord Toyotomi Hideyoshi described <i>shakudo</i> as having 'the colour of rain on a crow's wing'. The edges of the peak and the leading edges of the side curved fittings (<i>fukigaeshi</i>) are also of <i>shakudo</i> with finely engraved floral decoration; they also have round decoration in <i>shakudo</i> of stylised hollyhock leaves, the family crest of Tokugawa family, the samurai clan who ruled Japan from 1603 to 1868. 

This was a period of relative peace in Japan after the victory of Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 which paved the way for the rule of the Tokugawa Shoguns. From 1615, when Tokugawa defeated his last enemies at the Battle of Osaka Castle, the samurai class had little further occasion to test their skills in battle but were nevertheless required to maintain their military arts. Armour was increasingly relegated to a ceremonial role, not least on the annual samurai processions from their regional domains to Edo (modern-day Tokyo) and the Tokugawa court. Decoration and appearance took precedence over practicality and armourers had the opportunity to develop their skills and their patrons could reveal personal taste in the fine fittings of their processional armour.",'animal_fibre'

The narrower band below it mentions the first four caliphs, Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and Ali.

Caring for the Prophet’s tomb was a notable honour. When the Ottoman dynasty ruled Medina (1517–1916), special textiles were made to cover his tomb. Similar textiles were sent to decorate the Ka’bah in Mecca. Contact with the holy places imbued these covers with ‘barakah’ or divine grace.

"At the time of acquisition in 1871 there were similar hangings in the Royal Palace at Madrid, and these were thought to have come from Naples.

This frieze is made up of figures cut from the same silk as that designed by Jean-Demosthène Dugourc and woven by the Lyonnais manufacturer Camille Pernon for the ballroom in the Casita del Labrador at Aranjuez in 1797. The satin was woven with a design of four different rows of figures; in each row comprised two figures of the same design across the width of the textile. The black ground is a 1 and 8 satin. The length of the repeat was approximately 2.2 metres, the width of the fabric 55 cm (a typical Lyonnais silk width). 

A full uncut length of the textile exists in the Musée des Tissus in Lyon, Inv. no. 24804/1. In the Sala de la Torre, Casita del Principe in el Escorial two pieces of upholstered furniture have applied motifs from the same design - the first, a firescreen has three of the figures sewn side by side (i.e. half widths seamed together), applied with embroidery, and the second, a chair has a single figure sewn on its back. In each case embroidery has been used to apply the motifs to a ground of another silk. In the first case, embroidered motifs artfully take the eye away from the seams, as they do in the V&A example. There is also a chair-seat and back at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and a wall-hanging at the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio that are put together the in the same way (See <i>Soieries de Lyon.

The tradition of symbolic images chosen for tournaments, also known as impresa, during the Elizabethan era carried over to the decoration of articles of adornment such as sleeves, gloves, earrings and pendants.  Scenting articles of dress was standard practice.

"This type of silk was known as a lustring or lutestring in the 18th century. Delicate and lightweight, it was characterised by a lustre on its surface, and was considered particularly suitable for use in summer. 

This example can be dated because of its resemblance to a watercolour design for a silk by the Spitalfields master weaver and designer James Leman, dated 1720 (E.4507-1909).  He has inscribed it ‘silver lustring for Mr Alexander'. Mr Alexander would have been the mercer (silk dealer) commissioning the design. The type of silk, lustring, was specified at the design stage, so Leman knew that he had to produce a suitably delicate pattern. The fact that its pattern was to be created in silver thread would always have been specified at that stage too, as care had to be taken by the designer to produce a design that allowed maximum visibility of the silver on the front of the silk and minimum on the back, where it would not be seen.",'animal_fibre'

"This quill-pen cutter in gilt brass is a simple mechanical device developed in the late 17th century to solve the problem of trimming a feather into a useable pen. In 1729, Isaac de la Chaumette recorded a patent for ‘a pen knife yt make ye pen at once’ although no details survive. This French quill cutter works by screwing the blades down onto the scoop of the quill to cut and slit the nib. Few mechanical quill cutters survive from this date and it is likely that most writers continued to use penknives or bought pens prepared by a professional quill cutter. John Wilkes, the owner of a Pen and Quill Warehouse was doubtful about the utility of these quill cutters, writing in 1799 that “… their pens were cut with an engine, an attempt that was made once, but by which many thousand quills were spoiled without any benefit to the sagacious inventor or improvement to the Public”. 

The large-scale expansion of the brass industry in Europe dates from the late 17th century. It was driven by improvements in the supply of zinc combined with an increasing understanding of the chemical structure of the alloy. At the same time brass founders began to favour moulds of sand instead of clay. This reduced the cost of casting, and soon the range of cast brass goods increased dramatically. By the 19th century, brass had become extremely versatile and inexpensive and the applications were almost endless.",'animal_fibre'

"This type of voided velvet was one of the most expensive types of silk on the market in Renaissance Europe, being used for furnishings, secular dress and ecclesiastical vestments in elite circles. It was expensive because it made use of expensive raw materials (silk and gold), was time-consuming to weave, and required skilled labour. Production was organised in a guild system.

The main centres of silk weaving in fourteenth and fifteenth century Europe were in Italian cities - Venice, Milan, Lucca, Florence, Genoa, Bologna, although some Spanish centres in eastern and southern Spain attempted to compete. Valencia, for example, imported Genoese weavers at the end of the fifteenth century to set up a guild of velvet weavers (<i>Art de Velluters</i> and the Cofradía de San Jerónimo (1479-83)).

"This fragment represents the most expensive type of textiles made in Renaissance Europe. The term used to describe them, ‘cloth of gold’, emphasises the fact that they are woven of yarns made of precious metal (usually beaten gold or silver wound round a silk thread) and silk. Weaving with metal thread was a very skilled process, requiring weavers who had undertaken a long apprenticeship before gaining status as masters and setting up their own workshops. Such rich silks would have been woven to commission for individual clients as they were so costly. Wearing a silk like this was a sign of extreme wealth, as the metal was 'real' currency.

The main centres of silk weaving in 14th- and 15th-century Europe were in Italian cities — Venice, Milan, Lucca, Florence, Genoa, Bologna — although some centres in eastern and southern Spain attempted to compete. These centres supplied domestic markets and clients in northern Europe.",'animal_fibre'

"A fashionable woman's underwear

Women's underwear had two functions in the 18th century: hygienic and structural.

The shift formed a hygienic barrier between body and clothing. Few women wore drawers.

Stays and hoops were structural garments, designed to create the fashionable silhouette. Stays, the antecedent of the corset, formed a rigid foundation for the gown. The hoop supported the volume of the petticoat, as the skirt was known in the 18th century.

A Miss Davis ordered this hoop, with a gown and petticoat, from a London robe maker.

"The impetus to form a collection of Persian textiles in South Kensington was generated by the fear that modernization might weaken Iran's artistic traditions. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, the building of an international telegraph system, the introduction of steam navigation on the Caspian Sea and improved transportation within Iran opened the country to foreign merchants who negotiated trade treaties which were seldom favourable to their hosts.  Imported goods, especially textiles, were cheaper than those produced locally. In the 1850s cotton, woollen and silk cloth brought from Britain accounted for 66% of Iran's total imports; in the 1880s this had dropped a little to 63%.  
The competition from cheap imported goods coupled with a change in taste prompted the preference for foreign styles and had a severe effect on Iranian textile production.  Several years of drought and famine, which resulted in as many as 2 million people dying in 1871-72, compounded the problems and many textile crafts almost ceased to exist.

In 1876, to increase the presence of Iranian arts and crafts in London and to encourage the British to buy Iranian goods, the Shah instructed his Minister, Amin al-Mulk, to organise a gift of textiles to the Museum, including this example, which was delivered in March 1877.",'animal_fibre'

"This hand-woven and block-printed tusser silk was manufactured by Thomas Wardle and Co. in around 1875.  It shows the influences of Persian and Turkish design, reflecting the manufacturer's interest in historical Eastern patterns, and the more general fashion for exotic patterns in the nineteenth century.  The design was also block printed on cotton, and a version was shown at the 1888 Arts and Crafts Exhibition.  

Thomas Wardle was a leading textile manufacturer and dyer working in Leek, Staffordshire.  He took over his father's dyeworks in the early 1870s, and went on to become one of the leading British textile manufacturers of the late 19th century.  

Wardle was recognised as an expert on the Indian silk industry.  He first visited Bengal in 1885, and lectured widely on the importance of the tusser (wild) silk of India.  The textured, brown fibres of tusser silk were notoriously resistant to dye, which Wardle successfully overcame in the early 1870s by first bleaching the silk.  

Wardle was an early member of the Arts and Crafts Movement, and acquired patterns from leading designers such as Morris, Day, Crane, Voysey, and Butterfield.  He produced fabrics for stores including Liberty & Co., Heal & Son and Debenham & Freebody, and between 1883 and 1888 he also traded through his own shop on New Bond Street.",'animal_fibre'

"Silk ribbons were used for a multitude of utilitarian and decorative purposes in 18th-century fashionable dress – for the ornamentation of women’s gowns, for garters to keep up stockings, for lacing for stays and shoes, for tying back wigs and ornamenting elaborate hairstyles and headdresses.  Diderot’s Encyclopaedia in 1772 described these uses succinctly in its definition of ribbon: ‘a flat, narrow and thin fabric, used to tie, edge or ornament, for garments as well as furnishings’. Ribbons were subject to changes in fashion, just as wide silks were. 

Ribbons could be bought at fairs, from travelling pedlars or from the high class retailers of major cities such as Paris (e.g. the marchands merciers of the Faubourg St Honoré which is still the city's  luxury quarter today). These retailers stocked large quantities of ribbons of all sorts - from the simplest to the most elaborate - to sell to their customers, French ribbons being complemented by Dutch, Flemish, German and Swiss goods.",'animal_fibre'

"This embroidered panel would have belonged to a set of three valances, their purpose to adorn the head of a bed, concealing the pole and rungs of the bed curtains. Often embroidered with brightly coloured wools and silks, valances provided a means of decorative insulation from the draughts, cold and humidity that could plague sixteenth-century houses. 

Beds and their textiles figure prominently in inventories of effects from the Renaissance, an indication of how greatly they were valued. Individuals of high rank conveyed their position to their contemporaries through conspicuous consumption, with a lavish display of costly textiles.

This valance is worked entirely in tent stitch, a term that is derived from the French word 'tendre', meaning to stretch or extend. This was a reference to the stretching of the canvas on which the embroidery would be worked. French embroiderers, however, employed a different term for the stitch, calling it <i>petit point</i>, or 'little stitch'. 

The lively scene depicted here is that of the mythological union of Mars and Venus in the Garden of Love. Mars has laid his weapons aside and is kneeling in supplication to Venus, an act that symbolised Love vanquishing Aggression.

"The following information derives from Colenbrander and Browne, 2007 :

In the 18th century Chinese patterned silks imported into Europe were wider than silks in France (regulated) or England; evidence in the British East India Company archives shows that the ordered widths were generally 72 to 79 cm. Amsterdam did not have any regulations on width in its silk production, so silks could be woven as wide or as narrow as was commercially prudent, and a style of silk was developed there which appears to have been in competition with or imitation of these wide Chinese silks.
 
In the Richelieu Collection in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, among the textile samples described as <i>Etoffes d’ hollande </i>are eight pages with 33 samples of patterned silks identified as <i>Indienne</i>. They are all dated 1736 and described as 9/8 of an ell wide (78 cm). This compares with the standard width of 54 cm for French silks. There is earlier evidence that such wide silks were woven in Amsterdam, with the oldest reference to a 9/8 ell wide silk dating from 1707. Four pieces of brocaded silk were seized by English Customs because they were believed to have been made in India and not in Holland (in England an import ban of Indian and East Indian silks had been issued in 1699 and from 1702 onwards imports of Chinese silks were forbidden in France). Each piece was 9/8 of an ell wide, and they were in fact Dutch fabrics woven in Amsterdam. In 1720 flowered (brocaded) silks <i>a l’indienne</i> and 9/8 of an ell wide were again stated as being woven in Amsterdam. By the time of their inclusion in the Richelieu Collection in the 1730s, these fabrics were only referred to as <i>indienne</i> with no further reference to their width, presumably because by then it was clearly known that an <i>indienne</i> was about 78 cm wide and therefore no longer necessary to mention in the notarial acts. The latest statements found so far regarding an Amsterdam origin for <i>indienne</i> date from 1754. Apart from some sent to England, all the silks were destined for Marseille and Paris.
All of the silks so far identified as belonging to this class of silk woven to such width in Amsterdam have elements of chinoiserie in their design, with many elements found to originate from illustrations in Dutch travel accounts published in the seventeenth century and popular eighteenth century sources such as the engravings made by Petrus Schenk junior, whose Nieuw geinventeerde Sineesen were first printed in 1725.",'animal_fibre'

Caring for the Prophet’s tomb was a notable honour. When the Ottoman dynasty ruled Medina (1517–1916), special textiles were made to cover his tomb.

"Tapestries in this particular genre with mixed Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Turkish elements have become known as ‘in the Indian Manner’ after contemporary references, the earliest of which is in a bill from John Vanderbank, Yeoman Arrasworker to the Great Wardrobe. Dated August 1690, it was for “4 Peeces of fine Tapestry Hangings designed and workt after the Indian Manner” for Queen Mary’s withdrawing room at Kensington Palace. Indian Manner tapestries exist in a number of variations, reflecting their popularity in late 17th and early 18th-century England and Scotland, and their  different sizes and formats demonstrate how easily they could be customised to a client’s needs. Their subjects were partly imaginary and partly based on the text and illustrations of travels books like Arnoldus Montanus’s Atlas Japannensis (1669) and Atlas Chinensis (1671), and The Embassy to China of Johan Nieuhof (1665), which were translated into English by John Ogilby soon after their first publication. The overall effect intended by the tapestries seems to have been an imitation of Chinese and Japanese lacquer (called ‘Japan’ or ‘India Japan’) which was imported into Europe in large quantities in the late 17th century for use as screens and wall-panels. Surviving examples of the Indian Manner genre include tapestries signed by Vanderbank at Belton House (woven in 1691-92, contract in the Belton House Archive), Weston Park and in the V&amp;A (T.362-1910). Most surviving Indian Manner tapestries are therefore usually catalogued as woven by Vanderbank or his workshop, or in his style.
As Mazarind’s signature on the current Indian Manner tapestry is otherwise unknown, it has been interpreted in all 20th-century references to it as an indication that he was likely to have been an associate of Vanderbank’s. In the most influential of them, Edith Standen’s extensive study of Indian Manner tapestries published in 1981, she identified the genre’s origin in two series produced by Vanderbank which she differentiated and gave the modern titles of ‘Chinoiserie’ (with preponderantly Chinese and Japanese elements) and ‘Indian’ (basically Indian, with Chinese and Turkish elements). She described the current tapestry, and with reference to its signature, called Mazarind “a weaver otherwise totally unknown…but he was evidently closely connected with Vanderbank”. 
Thanks to research by Wendy Hefford, we now know that Michael Mazarind had an independent workshop, in premises previously occupied by the tapestry-maker James Bridges and which were from 1702 occupied by members of the Chabeneix family of tapestry weavers. It can be seen that the cartoons used for Mazarind’s tapestries were completely different from those associated with Vanderbank. The designer is unknown (as for all the other series) but it seems likely that he drew on the works of John Ogilby for some of his inspiration.
The distinctive design characteristics of the current tapestry confirm the origin in Mazarind’s workshop of three other pieces, which also had the same border of blue and white porcelain. Two were sold from Ickwell Bury in 1927 (illustrated in H C Marillier’s manuscript Subject Catalogue of Tapestries in the V&amp;A). Of those one is now in the David Collection, Copenhagen; the whereabouts of the other is unknown. The remaining, smaller piece was purchased with the current tapestry by the McLarens at the Christies sale in 1919 and is now in a private collection. None of these other three pieces has Mazarind’s signature, however.
This is the only surviving tapestry marked with the name of Mazarind. It is the only surviving tapestry of this particular design, and its condition through careful ownership by one family since the early 20th century is good enough to reveal the distinctive style and content that distinguishes a series comprising at least four tapestries. The series is likely to have been designed and woven before 1700, as part of a Mazarind design from it is copied in a documented set of three pieces sold by Leonard Chabaneix to the Earl of Melville in December 1700. Those tapestries survive and are in the Toms Collection, Lausanne, and the Beit Foundation, Russborough, Ireland.
So far, tantalizingly little is known about Mazarind and his workshop, and the nature of his relationship with Chabaneix. In 1984 the first documentary evidence connected with him was published by Wendy Hefford (‘Huguenot Weavers in and around London 1680-1780’, Proceedings of the Huguenot Society of London, vol.XXIV, no.2, 1984, pp.103-112). She established from the rate books of St Martin-in-the-Fields, Out Ward, that a tapestry weaver called Michael Mazarind had been paying rates on workshop premises for several years, and that in 1702 the rates assessed on the premises were taken over from Mazarind by Leonard Chabaneix. The references to Michael Mazarind in the rate books, giving his name in a number of different spellings, date back to 1696. In the catalogue entry by Koenraad Brosens on the Indian Manner tapestry in the collection of the Art Institute of Chicago (2008), Brosens speculated on the identity of Mazarind, raising questions as to the varied contributions to multiple different versions of Indian Manner tapestries made by Vanderbank, Mazarind and Chabaneix including shared use of the same cartoons.
However, since then, Wendy Hefford’s ongoing research and analysis has established the particular significance of the Mazarind series. The series of which the current tapestry is part was not connected with Vanderbank’s two series (‘Chinoiserie’ and ‘Indian’, as identified by Standen) but was instead a contemporary competitor on the market. The inter-relationship of the different versions of Indian Manner tapestries is highly complex. From these three separate series (two by Vanderbank and one Mazarind), all woven before 1700, nearly all later Indian Manner tapestries descended.",'animal_fibre'

"In 14th and 15th-century Italy, the textile industry produced many silks with decorative patterns or figurative designs, such as this woven band. They were used as the borders on ecclesiastical vestments. The design process required knowledge of the loom. While some painters, such as the now famous Sandro Botticelli, made designs for woven textiles, their designwork was converted into a form suitable for weaving either by weavers or by specialist designers who worked under contract to silk firms and were affiliated with the silk weaving guilds. 

The design for this particular band is attributed to Bartolomeo di Giovanni who was active as a painter between 1483 and 1511 in Florence. It is not possible to be sure that he was the author, as the medium of silk weaving would have distorted his original design.",'animal_fibre'

NEEDLEWORKING SKILLS<br>
Ladies in polite society were expected to be proficient in a wide range of needleworking skills. The graceful rhythm of techniques such as knotting or netting was thought to show off the elegance of a lady's hands. Embroidery, knitting and crochet are still current today.

"There are alternative transliterations of the name of the firm: Sapozhnikovy versus Sapognikoffs and what is in our original accession register, Saposnikoff.

Up until the revolution of 1917, Sapognikoffs' textile factory (former ""Peredovaya Tekstilshina"", now Bolshevo) was Russia's most famous textile factory. Sapognikoff silks and gold brocades were well known for elaborate patterns, vibrant colours and superior quality. The firm won grand-prix and gold medals several times at international and World exhibitions in the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. 

Sapognikoff brothers were considered the best silk manufacturers in Russia. In 1852 they became official suppliers of the Imperial court, their textiles being used for upholstery, window curtains and draperies in Imperial palaces and in the mansions of the Russian aristocracy. They also supplied the army with flags and standards, the Russian clergy with fabric for vestments and the court with ceremonial garments.  

The Sapognikoff brothers were descendents of an ancient Russian merchant dynasty. Grigoriy Grigor’evich Sapognikoff founded the famous textile firm, buying a factory in 1836, located in NovoBasmannaya street, near Red Gates. In 1843, only 5 years after opening, he displayed patterned satin textiles at a Russian exhibition. Gold and silver embroidered textiles, produced at the Sapognikoff factory, won first prize at the exhibition in 1849.  After the death of its founder, the factory passed to his wife Vera Vladimirovna, and sons, Alexander and Vladimir, who founded “A.&V. Sapognikoff”. 

Manufacturing volumes increased in 1875 when the brothers moved part of their factory from Moscow to Moscow Uyezd. In 1869, they bought a small cloth factory in Maksimkovo village and a wool factory in Kurakino village, in 1875. These factories were considered not profitable. The decision to move the factory to Uezd was made by Sapognikoff brothers after it was severely damaged in fire. This accident also made them consider improvements in health and safety conditions on their premises. 

In 1877, Alexander (the older brother) died, leaving Vladimir Grigor’evich in charge of the family business. He realized that it was his chance to introduce a series of radical innovations. The most crucial one was moving all the stages of the production cycle under one roof. The most technologically challenging tasks, such as, combing and spinning silk, degumming and dyeing were traditionally performed by third-party sub-contractor workshops. By performing these tasks in-house, Valdimir Sapognikoff gained direct control over the production process and the quality of the textiles, and increased factory efficiency. The weaving department was equipped with 60 hand-operated brocade looms, as well as 250 fully mechanical jacquard looms. Jacquard looms had first been brought to Russia from France in 1882.

The range of textiles, produced at Kurakino factory was wide. The most exotic types of silk fabrics, as well as, more common crêpe de chine, poplin, taffeta, satin-vellore and marquisette were mentioned in factory weavers’ books. The most common motifs of Sapognikoff’s brocades featured leaves, forgive-me-nots, roses, circles, crosses and trees. Traditional elements of brocade design were often combined into more complex sets, which were given names in the factory weavers’ books.  For example, the “lady” brocade was decorated with grass, palm leaves, azalea, bindweed, tulips, dahlias, mayweeds, cornflowers, bellflowers and long branches. Weavers’ books from Sapognikoff factory always featured textile swatches next to their descriptions. The books are kept in Moscow Central Historical Archive. The colours of the textile swatches are still vibrant.

The majority of orders were came from Tula, Vladivostok, Kharkov, Baku, Kiev, Riga, Tashkent, Rostov-na-Donu, Petrograd and Warsaw. “Mure and Marilee’s” (spelling in English is unclear - now named Central Department Store or TSUM), a large department store in Moscow, regularly placed orders.  By 1912, the factory at Kurakino employed 730 workers, and was equipped with steam-, oil-, gasoline-, and water-power machinery, with total power of over 247 horsepower.  The same year, the Sapognikoff factory in Moscow employed 203 workers and was equipped by 1 steam- and 1 water-powered generator with the total power about 53 horsepower. Moscow factory produced only special orders which often included elaborate artwork. 

In February 1912, “A.&V. Sapognikoff” firm became a joint-stock company. Grigoriy Vladimirovitch Sapognikoff (son of Vladimir Grigor’evich) was made the head of the company.

It is important to mention that Vladimir Grigor’evich Sapognikoff was the person who established the most successful textile factory in the history of Russia. As the majority of merchants of that time, he received home education, which was fairly limited. He was actively involved in social activities and charity. He also was the chairman of Moscow Merchant Society for several years in a row, chairman of Moscow Stock Committee Council; the member of Council of Manufacture and Trade; he also represented merchants in Moscow City Council and was the chairman or the member of curatorial councils of various education institutions, such as, The Stroganoff college of arts, Alexandroff college of commerce, college of commerce for women and practical academy of commercial sciences. V.G. Sapognikoff was given hereditary nobility for his contribution to development of Russian silk industry, and was became Manufacture Counsellor. In 1910 he became the State Counsellor.   

V.G. Sapognikoff’s innovative manufacturing techniques contributed also to further development of distinctive style in Russian textiles. His firm annually donated prize money for contests held at Stroganoff college of arts. Sapognikoff’s enthusiasm was well paid out. His factory became extremely competitive and well known abroad. “A.&V. Sapognikoff” firm received 6 grand-prix and 5 gold medals at 11 international exhibitions. The firm also took part in the variety of National exhibitions, and thus earned permission to use Russian coat of arms on their textiles. 

However, working and living conditions for  factory workers were fairly poor. According to a 1912 report, single male and female workers were given a small ‘bed sits’ in the halls. Families lived in slightly larger rooms, which were separated from each other with thin low separators, and shared facilities and communal areas. At the same time the conditions, which Sapognikoff factory provided for its workers, were far better than what the majority of workers in Russia dealt with. Female and male workers’ blocks both featured several kitchens and a canteen. There was also a primary school for children aged 10-14, who worked at the factory. For underage workers, work at the factory started at 6 a.m. and continued till 9.30, when they had a 30 minutes breakfast break. Classes at school continued from 10 a.m. till 2 p.m. followed by 1 hour lunch break, after which work continued from 5.30 p.m till 8 p.m. 

Sapognikoff textiles were exhibited in 1993 at the Russian textiles of the 18th-19th century exhibition of held in the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts.

Armenian priests wore this vestment, the shurjar, to celebrate Mass. Its semi-circular form is similar to the Western cope.

The two most popular designs were the curved lattice, and rows of stylised flowers or stars.

Yarn made of silk thread wrapped with silver (or gilded silver) can be woven or used for embroidery. Metal strips interwoven with silk produce luxurious shiny fabric or ribbon (gota) which can be applied onto cloth.

"Silver Gallery:
This gauntlet or glove is made of steel damascened with a design of military trophies, palm branches and wreaths, referring to its military associations. Damascening uses gold or silver to decorate a base metal such as iron or brass. After a design is traced over on the object, a hammer and punch is used to push gold or silver wire into prepared channels on the surface. The gauntlet is thought to be part of a set of three armours made for the sons of Philip III of Spain (1609-41). Very grand, costly armour was part of the equipment for a prince or noble of this period. This armour used gold and silver as well as a beautiful crimson silk lining with gold and silver embroidery.

The professional male embroiderers from the Mochi community in Kutch developed this embroidery technique by using a hook, as well as a needle. This was an adaptation of a method previously used on leather. Embroideries such as this were made for and sold to wealthy Indian patrons. [27/03/2003]
EMBROIDERED SKIRT 

Professional male embroiderers of Kutch’s Mochi community embroidered skirt cloths like this for wealthy patrons. They used a hooked awl (ari) to create its fine chain-stitch, a technique adapted from leatherwork.

"The source of the story in the tapestries is pseudo-Turpin's version of the <i>Chanson de Roland</i> and especially <i>La Bataille de Rainchevaux</i>, a 13th century account deriving from pseudo-Turpin. The real battle was the last of Charlemagne's first campaign to capture Spain, an attempt that ended in failure. Roland and the rear guard were left behind the main army, and were attacked at the Roncevaux pass in the Pyrenees by the Basques on August 15, 778, when the Franks were completely annihilated. This minor battle was romanticized by oral tradition into a major conflict between Christians and Saracens (both sides were Christians), where Charlemagne comes to the resue of Roland and destroys the Saracens. When <i>The Song of Roland</i> was written down, by an unknown troubadour of the 11th century, it became the first chanson de gest or epic poem of medieval France.",'animal_fibre'
"This silk playbill was printed for a matinée performance at the Lyceum Theatre, 12 February 1884, of two plays by W.S.Gilbert. Silk playbills were often issued in the 19th century for special evenings at the theatre and this was one of  two issued for this performance, identical apart from the colours of the print and the fringe. They may have been printed in different colours for the different parts of the theatre, but the playbills themselves give no clue to why they were printed in alternative colours.

The Lyceum was Irving's theatre at the time, but as he was on tour in America in the winter and spring of 1883 to 1884, Charles Abud was the acting manager. W.S.Gilbert was best known by 1884 for the operas he had written with Sullivan, although their most famous work <i>The Mikado</i> was not produced until 1885. <i>Pygmalion & Galatea</i> was a revival, originally seen at the Haymarket Theatre in 1871, but this was the first production of <i>Comedy & Tragedy</i>, which had opened at the Lyceum on 26th January.  The playbill shows that Gilbert was the director for both of his plays at the Lyceum which starred the popular American actress Mary Anderson.",'animal_fibre'
"This fragment of a much larger tapestry shows one of the seven sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church: Confirmation. A sacrament is an outward sign of an invisible grace (or spiritual gift) from God through the ministry of his Church. In Confirmation baptised children are made full members of the Church.

The fragment comes from a hanging in which the Seven Sacraments are shown arranged in two horizontal layers, with a central scene of the <i>Apparition of the Holy Spirit</i>. The lower register of the complete tapestry shows scenes of the sacraments with the participants in 15th-century dress. The upper register shows Old Testament prefigurations ('precursors') of the seven sacraments. The seven sacraments include Baptism, Confirmation into the Church as seen here, the Holy Eucharist (partaking of the Body and Blood of Christ at Mass) and Extreme Unction (administered to the dying). Other parts of the tapestry are in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Burrell Collection in Glasgow.

The scene is also interesting in that it shows both ecclesiastical and fashionable dress. The bishop on the right is shown wearing a cope (the cape-like outer garment worn for church ceremonies) and a mitre (a pointed hat worn only by bishops and archbishops). He is cutting the hair of a boy in preparation for his being into the Church.

"In the 1690s upholstered settees formed part of the lavish furnishings of the state rooms of a great house, which were created to demonstrate the wealth and status of the owner.  Often, settees were supplied with sets of chairs ensuite, and were upholstered to match a state bed. Their high backs were ideal for showing off expensive fabrics, which were usually brightly coloured. Fragments of the embroidered covers which have not been exposed to the light reveal the strong tones of the original red and yellow thread, which would have contrasted with the blue of the braid and fringing. This settee was almost certainly commissioned by Baron Coningsby when he remodelled and refurnished his house in the 1690s.  However, it is not known for which room it was intended or whether there were any chairs supplied ensuite.  The legs of the settee match those of the settee and chairs in the King's bedroom, which were covered in crimson silk damask to match the bed.

In the 17th century all shoes were 'straights', not shaped for the left or right foot. Fashionable men and women wore moderately high heels indoors. Rich silks and velvets were decorated with exquisite embroidery or braids and fastened with ribbons. French styles were popular after 1660, like the squared toe.

It is the sort of clothing sometimes depicted in the inventories of manufacturers and industrialists, for example. The suit is accessorised with fine cut steel buttons, which may be of English manufacture, possibly Birmingham or Wolverhampton. Cut steel accessories were stocked by high class retailers in Paris,who imported English made-goods, such as Madame Blakey's <i>Magazin Anglois</i> (English shop) in rue des Prouvaires, very close to the prestigious rue St Honoré.

"Fashionable men and women displayed their taste in the fine fabrics they chose for their clothes. Until the later 17th century most silks were imported. But a silk-weaving industry developed in England, centred around Spitalfields in London, which grew increasingly successful between 1700 and 1760. Huguenot refugee families, contributing technical and business skills, played an integral part in its development.

Spitalfields weavers produced plain and patterned fabrics. Designs changed season by season, influenced by French fashions but developing a distinctive English style. 

This fabric, woven in Spitalfields, is a brocaded silk, and was intended for ladies' gowns. The technique of brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into the pattern of a fabric in specific, sometimes very small areas. It was a more laborious process for the weaver than using patterning wefts running from selvedge to selvedge, but the resulting effect could be much more varied and lively. The extensive use of silver-gilt thread here indicates that it would have been a relatively expensive silk.",'animal_fibre'

Walnut with ivory, bone and horn, engraved with fine detail emphasised with a black mastic; of flat curved shape, decorated on the front with a figure of a huntsman with spear thrusting at a stag that is chased by a hound, overlooked by a squirrel nibbling a nut, near an acorn. The background and sides the sides of the flask with scrolling stems, berries, and larger round fruits bordered with a double line of stringing. The base is veneered with ivory, engraved with a coat of arms, the initials B.W.I.T. and the date 1603. The back is plain but for a double band of stringing. The top is mounted with an iron lid, with sprung nozzle. Attached through two cord loops on metal ring screws is a thin cord of pink silk and silver/silver gilt threads, terminating in two pink and silver tassels. Linked to this thin cord is a thicker cord with blue and pink threads to which is fixed a large red tassel, both though to be 19th or 20th century.

Note on materials
The ivory has been used for all the larger pictorial elements, and the two larger sizes of circles. 
This identification is based on the strong 'grain' type structure associated with Schraeger lines that is clearly visible.

Bone has been used for the long thicker stringing that forms the border to the pictorial element.
This is based on the vessel structure that is visible, combined with the slightly whiter colour in comparison with the areas thought to be horn.

Horn has been used for the sinuous stringing within the pictorial area and for the smallest circles.
This is based on what appears to be a fibrous/vessel structure that is completely translucent in places.
(Strictly speaking, bone and horn have the same vessel structure and can only definitively be distinguished by sampling and examining under high magnification. See Rivers and Umney, Conservation of Furniture, Oxford 2003, pp. 199-201).

Design sources
The motif of leaping stag confronted by a spearman and pursued by a leaping hound may derive, at least in part and reversed from Jost Amman (Hollstein, part II, no. 277, p.93, third tier). The man to the right of the powder flask scene corresponds closely with the figure of the man to the right in Virgil Solis’ ‘Hare Hunt with a Falcon and a Stag Hunt’, though the position of the legs is reversed (Hollstein Vol LXIV, p. 190, No. 519). The squirrel with nut, against a background of swirls, may well derive from Virgil Solis (Hollstein vol. LXIV, no. 573, p.244 'Frieze with 18 Birds and a Squirrel').",'animal_fibre'

"This box was almost certainly made as part of a toilet service. Toilet services were used by both men and women as part of a public dressing ceremony known as the <i>levée</i>or <i>toilette</i>. The custom of the <i>levée</i>was started in the 17th century by Louis XIV. Adopted by the French upper classes, it continued as an important form of elite socialising through the 18th century. Toilet sets were key to the performance of wealth and fashion that was entailed in the ceremony of the <i>toilette</i>. Consisting of a series of boxes, dishes and a mirror, toilet services were expensive items made from luxury materials. 

This box is decorated using a technique known as boulle marquetry, in which brass (and often pewter) motifs are inlaid into an expensive turtleshell ground. This technique was developed in the late 17th-century in the workshop of André-Charles Boulle (1642-1732), a cabinet-maker who worked for the French court and nobility. Boulle marquetry remained fashionable in France (and across Europe) through the 18th and 19th centuries.",'animal_fibre'

"Covers made for chairs, settees and stools are among the richest sources of eighteenth century pictorial needlework. Sets were embroidered often with a mix of pastoral, biblical and classical scenes, enclosed in approximately matching floral wreathes to give unity to the set. They were undertaken both by professional workshops, and by amateur needlewomen, patrticularly in the form of canvaswork, which was usually worked in the basic counted thread stitches of tent stitch and cross stitch, learnt by most girls as part of their needlework education. Skill at needlework was considered an accomplishment in women, who could demonstrate their expertise by embroidering decorative yet functional items such as chair seats.
