Their histories may have begun in the royal apartments at Versailles. During the nineteenth century this example now at the Metropolitan Museum belonged to Baron Mayer de Rothschild, a member of the distinguished banking and art-collecting family, who kept it at Mentmore Towers, his palatial and splendidly appointed residence in Buckinghamshire. In 1964 it went under the hammer in London and fetched the highest price ever paid at auction for a piece of furniture, attracting tremendous media attention.[1]The New York and London commodes are related closely to each other and to the latter’s nearly identical counterpart at the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum in Munich, with which it once formed a pair in the collection of the grand duke of Sachsen-Weimar.[2] All three pieces are so-called commodes à vantaux, which means they have three doors concealing interior drawers; however, they all include a shelf compartment, rather than drawers, behind the central door, which transforms the type into a combination of the commode à vantaux and a variation called commode en bas d’armoire.[3]All three commodes have six feet. The feet of the New York commode, however, represent a unique departure in Roentgen’s oeuvre. Although the four outside feet are square as usual, the two front middle feet are trapezoidal and decorated with mounts on the three visible sides, lending an extra element of luxury. The fronts of the commodes are divided into three vertical sections, and the frieze contains a single drawer that runs the full width of each piece. The sides and the three front door panels are decorated with marquetry: the former show musicians—woodwind and stringed-instrument players—and the center panel on the front shows a scene of actors on a stage. In several ways, the marquetry of the New York commode differs from its two counterparts. It probably originally resembled the others closely, but major alterations were undertaken at some point after the French Revolution, when the taste of the ancient régime fell into disrepute. The absorbing story of how the New York commode was changed can be found in an appendix by Mechthild Baumeister in this volume. Suffice it here to mention four major differences: First, the two lateral doors on the front of the Metropolitan’s commode show two empty stages, whereas those doors on the London and Munich commodes display theater boxes filled with people watching the performance taking place in the scene on the central door. Second, the panels on the sides of all three pieces are the same, but those on the New York commode are reversed, with the woodwind players on the proper right side. Third, the frieze mounts on the New York commode are replacements of mounts similar to their counterparts and by another hand. The mounts on the feet and stiles are also different. Fourth, the original blue-gray marble tops preserved on the London and Munich commodes have been replaced on the Metropolitan’s by a red brocatelle marble slab. [4]Inside the three commodes, the layout is similar, but the hidden mechanisms in the London and Munich examples are more sophisticated. The large frieze drawer, the doors, and the top interior drawers of the latter are opened by different actions of a single key in one keyhole, which is concealed by an ormolu rosette on the frieze drawer when not in use. The mechanism is weight- and spring-driven. On either side of the interior of the three commodes, the upper drawer can be swung sideways to access hidden compartments with secret drawers. The top of the front compartment lifts up on the London commode; it is covered with a tambour on the New York commode, giving access to a well.The finest mounts on the London commode are Paris-made; Neuwied examples are used in less-prominent places. The duotone gilding and surface chasing of the box-tie handles on the drawers are of the highest level that the workshop of François Rémond produced. The similarly delicate frieze mounts were replaced on the New York commode with a bold scrolling ornament, probably the work of the Paris bronze caster Étienne Martincourt.Januarius Zick, who frequently worked for David Roentgen, certainly designed the marquetry scenes on the front of the commodes as well as the ones on the sides, and undoubtedly Roentgen’s engraver Elie Gervais produced the line drawings for the marquetry cutters to work from. The central scene on the front features well-known characters from the Italian theatrical tradition known as the commedia dell’arte, which enjoyed a revival during the second half of the eighteenth century. Pictured are the clever servant Harlequin at right, his sweetheart, the lady’s maid, Columbine, in a flower-decorated straw hat on the left, and the aged Anselmo with a tricorne and walking stick in the center.[5] The scenes on the sides of the three commodes depict two musician in an airy room with an arched casement window: on one panel, a violinist and a cellist share a trestle stand with two sheets of music on it as they play. Brass horns hang on the wall. In the other panel, two woodwind players rest at a table. On the wall behind them are two oboes, and a bassoon leans against the music stand on which sheets of music are propped.The New York commode is branded twice on the uprights of its paneled back with a double V beneath a crown, which is the inventory mark of Versailles. Although it is uncertain that the back panel is original to the piece, it is not impossible that the commode originated in the private apartments of Louis XVI. Indeed, records of the king’s expenditures mention the payment of 2,400 livres on April 11, 1779, ""to the Germans for a big commode.""[6] But in an inventory of 1792, the scenes on the sides of that same commode are said to depict Astronomy and the Arts, rather than musicians.[7] This may represent a misunderstanding on the part of an inventory taker who did not recognize the oboes as musical instruments and thought the bassoon was a telescope. Moreover, the inventory was almost certainly made in a hurry, for the furniture was to be removed from Versailles and sold in Paris for cash to support the Revolution. Specific woods, including their coloration, and small chased ornaments mentioned in the inventory are found on the New York commode and not the other two, yet it is surprising that no mention is made of the commedia dell’arte scene. Another inventory of Versailles furnishings, made in 1793, that documents a smaller commode owned by the comtesse d’Artois, the sister-in-law of Louis XVI, does mention the commedia dell’arte scene.[8] But the measurements given in the inventories for the two commodes make Louis XVI’s slightly larger example a better match with the New York commode.[Wolfram Koeppe 2012]Footnotes:[1] On the Rothschilds, see Georg Heuberger, ed. The Rothschilds. 2 vols. Exh. cat. Jewish Museum, Frankfurt; 1994–95. Sigmaringen, 1994. [Published in German as Die Rothschilds.

Edinburgh, 1884, vol. 2, p. 187, no. 10, where it is described as in an upstairs gallery and as by David de Luneville (David Roentgen) and the Parisian mount maker Pierre Gouthière. Jack and Belle Linsky purchased the commode in 1964 for 63,000 pounds sterling ($176,000).[2] According to Hans Huth, the commode now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, and the very similar example now in the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich, were owned as a pair by the Grand Duke of Sachsen-Weimar; Hans Huth. Roentgen Furniture: Abraham and David Roentgen, European Cabinet-Makers. London, 1974, p. 46 [Also published in German as Abraham und David Roentgen und ihre Newuwieder Möbelwerkstatt. Munich, 1974]. See also Hans Huth. Abraham und David Roentgen und ihre Neuwieder Möbelwerkstatt. Deutscher Verein für Kunstwissenschaft. Berlin, 1928, p. 66, commentary on plate 40. One of the two was offered in the Sachsen-Weimar sale (Sotheby’s, London, June 10, 1932, lot 136), and the photographs reproduced in the accompanying catalogue are undoubtedly of the commode now at the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum. An annotated copy of the sale catalogue (archives of Sotheby’s London), however, clearly states that Lady Eckstein purchased the piece, which since 1948 has been in the collection of the Victoria and Albert Museum. Both museums believe that their commode is the one bought at that sale. A label preserved on the underside of the marble top of the London commode, ""Weimar R Schloss 21,"" and a pencil inscription also on the underside of the marble, ""Weimar 20,"" clearly refer to its Weimar provenance. Recent research by Dr. Gert-Dieter Ulferts and Christian Pönitz of the Klassik Stiftung Weimar did not reveal any further information about the history of the London and Munich commodes before the 1920s. In an e-mail of June 21, 2012, to Wolfram Koeppe, Gert-Dieter Ulferts mentioned that the label text and pencil inscription on the underside of the marble top of the London commode most likely refer to an inventory of the furniture in the Weimar residence (Residenzschloss Weimar) possibly made by the Hofmarschallamt in the 1920s and that the numbers 20 and 21 do not relate to a specific room in the castle. On the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum commode’s provenance, see Georg Himmelheber. ""Roentgenmöbel in Münchner Museen. XI. Kommode, um 1779, Bayerisches Nationalmuseum."" Weltkunst 61, no. 20 (October 15, 1991), pp. 3012–15.[3] Henry Havard. Dictionnaire de l'ameublement et de la décoration depuis le XVIIIe siècle jusqu'à nos jours. 4 vols.

London and New York, 1989, p. 210.[4] In an e-mail of May 7, 2012, to Wolfram Koeppe, Ferdinand Heinz said that in David Roentgen’s time, the blue-gray marble called bleu turquin was also known as bardiglio di Carrara. He added that the quarries of true bardiglio marble are located in the Apuan Alps, at a few locations north and east of the town of Carrara, in Tuscany. Koeppe has suggested elsewhere that the bleu turquin slabs on the London and Munich commodes came from a quarry near Leun on the Lahn River, not far from Neuwied, which belonged to the counts of Wied or their relatives; see Wolfram Koeppe in Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, Wolfram Koeppe, and William Rieder. European Furniture in The Metropolitan Museum of Art: Highlights of the Collection. New York, 2006, p. 181. Only a mineralogical analysis of the slabs will tell us exactly where the marble originated. The slab of red brocatelle marble on the New York commode comes from a Catalonian quarry near Tortosa; see Harald Mielsch. Buntmarmore aus Rom im Antikenmuseum Berlin.

The pied (foot), or pied du roi (king’s foot), equaled 32.48 centimeters, and the pouce (thumb, equivalent to the inch) measured 2.71 centimeters. Accordingly, the dimensions of Louis XVI’s commode given in the 1792 inventory would translate to 89.35 centimeters high (including the marble top), 135.34 centimeters wide, and 67.75 centimeters deep. The dimensions of the comtesse d’Artois’ commode given in the 1793 inventory would translate to 86.64 centimeters high, 129.92 centimeters wide, and 64.9 centimeters deep. The Metropolitan Museum’s commode is 89.5 centimeters high, 135.9 centimeters wide, and 69.2 centers deep (including the later red brocatelle marble top), and 86.5 centimeters high, 135.6 centimeters wide, and 66.8 centimeters deep without the marble top. It should be borne in mind, however, that until 1799 no single consistent system of measures was used in France, so these calculations must be viewed with caution.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/other_technique"

The group represents an early production for export of complex woven silks that integrate both Iberian and Asian aesthetics and design. In this example, the eagle holds in its talons arrows that pierce a heart-shaped vase. The device of a heart pierced by arrows is associated with the Augustinian religious order, while representations of floral vases were popular motifs in China. The conflation of pious and secular imagery seen here may be the result of free rein being given to the master weaver commissioned to produce the cloth. Although the pattern, colors, and general layout have a notable European character, a number of details point to an Asian hand in the design. The form of the oddly shaped leaf on the scrolling vines, for example, resembles Chinese floral patterns more than the European acanthus leaves we might expect to find, especially as associated with the grapelike fruit cluster motif that repeats throughout. Additionally, the stylized dark blue flowers are Chinese peonies; they alternate with the eagles, whose extended, erect neck feathers and patterned breasts recall the graphic means sometimes used by Chinese artisans to render the image of a phoenix. It could be that the weaver modified an original source (perhaps a European print) to incorporate these Asian elements within the overall European format. A related group of silks, possibly from a different workshop, shares some of the design features seen here, including the arrow-holding double-headed eagles amid scrolling vines, although in that group the eagles are contained within narrow vertical panels delineated by leafy borders. Multiple examples of textiles with this design exist; in general, they have the same crimson red (lac dye) ground and are decorated in two colors, blue and yellow. In addition to silk, these fine woven textiles incorporate flat threads of gold leaf on paper, typical of East Asian works.¹ A complete cope (Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto) and a portion of a chasuble (Victoria and Albert Museum, London) made of this fabric confirm that it was used in Christian ecclesiastical vestments.²  The exact location of production for this group of silks is unknown, but the combination of Iberian and Asian motifs and styles is typical of products exported through Macau, a major center of trade in the sixteenth century.Although other Macau silks possess similar design elements, the color scheme of this example, with its pattern of green, blue, and yellow, is distinctive.  It has been proposed, based on the motif of the arrow piercing the heart, that the fabric was made specifically for Augustinians active in the Philippines, but examples found in Spain, Portugal, and other European centers suggest it may have been part of the larger Iberian trade.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1. There are two examples in the Metropolitan's collection: acc. nos. 34.41.9 (red, blue, and yellow) and 34.41.1 (blue and yellow). The dyes used in this textile were analyzed by Nobuko Shibayama in the Department of Scientific Research, Metropolitan Museum, using High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Photo Diode Array (HPLC-PDA). The red color is lac dye, and the yellow is from the Asian pagoda tree (Sophora japonica). See also Digby, “Some Silks Woven under Portuguese Influence in the Far East,” pp. 52 - 63. 2.

Utilizing variations on a relatively small number of decorative motifs, most notably the pomegranate, palmette, artichoke, and garland, these silken-pile textiles developed from earlier fifteenth-century subtle voided patterns, formed by the appearance of the ground fabric where there was no pile on the surface, into visually and technically more complex designs. Here, the symmetrical pattern of elaborate artichoke forms within lobed compartments surrounded by ogivally arranged intertwined leaves and flowers is woven with metal thread, and some details are executed with metal loops (bouclé) for additional texture. The jewel-tone silk velvet primarily forms the background, which, in areas, has a subtle ""sculpted"" leaf pattern achieved by juxtaposing two different heights of the velvet pile.Woven in Italy—particularly Florence, Venice, and Genoa—and in Spain, velvets were coveted throughout Europe and also in Turkey, where production demonstrated reciprocal influences, especially with Venetian weavings. This particular example exhibits Eastern influence in the crenate collar or clip motif that secures the garlands. Contemporary paintings, inventories, and extant examples clearly indicate the international appeal of velvets and their varied uses: from ecclesiastical vestments to caftans and European-style garments for the very wealthy, to opulent furnishings, cloths of honor, and diplomatic gifts.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The thick, light-reflecting, tactile pile, which differentiates velvet from other silks, was achieved during the weaving process by using rods or wires to loop up warp threads rather than pull them tight and flat. This sumptuous example, which incorporates glittering strips of silver lamella running from selvedge to selvedge, is of a type popularly described as “cloth of silver” from the sixteenth century onward. This cloth of silver was displayed in European Textiles and Costume Figures, on view at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences (visible at far right in the photograph of 1938), and at Walton High School (visible at center right in the photograph of February 9, 1939).[Elizabeth Cleland, 2020]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

[the French] learn to play not barely for amusement, but also with a view to advantage; and, indeed, you seldom meet with a native of France, whether male or female, who is not a complete gamester, well versed in all the subtleties and finesses of the art.— Tobias Smollett, Travels through France and ItalyAs gaming was the principal indoor diversion of eighteenth-century France, a variety of tables was created, often for specific games like three-handed ombre or tri, piquet, or brelan. A description of one example in Lazare Duvaux’s account book suggests that this elegant folding table was used for quadrille. On August 9, 1753, the dealer sold a solid mahogany quadrille table ""I"" (folding on the diagonal), embellished with gilt bronze, and lined with cloth, to Madame de Pompadour for 85 livres.[1]When closed, the Museum’s table has a triangular shape and forms a synthesis of sinuous lines, echoed by the double curve of the cabriole legs. One of these S-shaped legs can be pulled backward to support the hinged top when unfolded. A shallow walnut drawer for storage of game essentials is recessed on top of this sliding leg. The rounded corners of the open top could be used for discarded cards and counters or for the placement of candlesticks to offer the players light on their game. Although not stamped, this table has been attributed to Bernard II van Risenburgh, based on the high quality of its tulipwood marquetry inlaid with floral and foliated sprays of end-cut kingwood.Epigraph.

Prince-bishop of Würzburg and, after 1757, also of Bamberg, Seinsheim divided his time between two official residences in those cities and his three summer castles, Veitschöchheim, Werneck, and Seehof.[1] Preferring the country to the city, Seinsheim spent about three months a year outside Bamberg, at Seehof, where he enjoyed walking and hunting. He was fond of gardens and did much to embellish the late-seventeenth-century castle and especially its park, where he ordered that a maze, a theater, and a cascade with grotto and trelliswork arcades be constructed.In 1761 he also resumed work on one of the ancillary buildings at Seehof, the Franckenstein Schlösschen. This garden pavilion at the east end of the orangery and greenhouses had been conceived as a place where the prince could retreat from the strict etiquette at his court. Built by the architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel (1703–1769) for one of Seinsheim's predecessors, Johann Philipp Anton von Franckenstein, prince-bishop from 1746 to 1753, the Schlösschen had been left unfinished at the time of Franckenstein's death. Contemporary records indicate that Seinsheim decided to have its two main rooms, the Saal and the Audience Chamber (also called the Arbor Room, or berceau), embellished with frescoes and stuccowork. All four walls of the Audience Chamber were to be decorated as an illusionary arbor with trelliswork and floral festoons. Franz Anton Ermeltraut, court painter at Würzburg, was commissioned to execute a small trompe l'oeil ceiling fresco. It is not known when this was finished because the work was delayed by occasional disputes between the patron and the painter and the latter's frequent illnesses.[2] No description of the room's interior was made when the Franckenstein Pavilion was demolished in the nineteenth century, but a drawing thought to be Ermeltraut's design for the Arbor Room has been preserved, illustrating its intended decoration.[3] Also, an inventory of 1774 at Schloss Seehof mentions a ""Grünes Perceau-zimmer,"" or Green Trelliswork Room, in the garden pavilion, showing that the room had been completed by then as planned.Among the furnishings listed were the two settees, together with a pair of matching armchairs and four side chairs that are also in the Museum's collection.[5] In addition, there were four wall brackets hanging in niches, two of which have been preserved as well.[6] These furnishings were described as ""von bildhauer Arbeith grün Lassirt,"" or carved and glazed green.Both the settees and the matching chairs have serpentine gilded frames consisting of large scrolls of various shapes and openwork aprons decorated with polychrome flowers and foliage. They are supported on slightly curved legs carved with a pattern of reeds, and rest on bun feet that are partly covered by foliage. Most unusual is the off-white studded latticework intertwined with gilded and painted foliage on the inner backs of the seats; this must have been in total harmony with the original setting of the furniture. The outer backs of the settees and armchairs were left unfinished, as they were intended to stand against the wall; the side chairs, however, have latticework carving on both sides and were meant to be seen in the round. Corresponding to the inventory description of 1774, traces of a green glaze, originally applied over the gilding, are still present on the furniture.[7] Subsequent inventories offer additional details about the pieces, mentioning their green silk-velvet seat cushions and their placement.[8] Being rather top-heavy and unsteady, the settees stood in two corners of the room and the armchairs are described as being fastened in the other two. Grooves in the outer backs of the settees seem to imply that they too were once secured to the walls of the room.It is, unfortunately, not known who was the maker of this unique garden-room furniture so expressive of the exuberant Rococo taste. Its sculptural silhouette and elaborate carving, the choice of linden wood, and the unusual construction and simple joinery all make it seem likely that a sculptor or master carver rather than a cabinetmaker was responsible for the set.[9] It has been suggested that Margravine Sophie Caroline von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1737–1817), of neighboring Bayreuth, presented the suite to Seinsheim.[10] This would explain the absence of bills in Seehof's archival records. The margravine is known to have visited Seinsheim regularly, and pieces of furniture were occasionally exchanged between them. Also in favor of a Bayreuth provenance is the florid style of the pieces: Rococo furniture of Bayreuth was characterized by unrestricted use of naturalistic motifs, such as flowers, foliage, reeds, and birds. There was also a preference in Bayreuth for naturalism in interiors. Several rooms in the more recent of Bayreuth's two castles, the Neues Schloss, were decorated before 1760 in imitation of latticework pavilions, the first examples of their kind in Germany.[11] A complete set of furniture would have been an unusually large gift, however. Since the Museum's suite was in such perfect harmony with its original setting, and given Seinsheim's attention to the smallest details of Seehof's embellishments, it seems more likely that the prince-bishop ordered it himself. With the exception of a corner settee in the Würzburg Residenz, no other pieces known today bear even the slightest resemblance to the Seehof set.[12] For this reason, and in the absence of contemporary documents, it is impossible to attribute the furniture to a specific artist.The settees, chairs, and wall brackets presumably remained in the Franckenstein Pavilion until it was pulled down, between 1867 and 1870, and were then transferred to the castle itself. Seehof, which was in the possession of the bishopric and then part of the Bavarian royal domain until 1842, had become the private property of Freiherr Friedrich von Zandt and his descendants. Photographs taken at the turn of the century and later show the furniture in the Zandt family dining room.[13] They indicate that large carved flowers, now missing, originally adorned the cresting of the frames. The castle survived World War II intact, but the interior furnishings were sold off after the death in 1951 of the last male heir of the Zandt family.[14] In 1956 the Munich antiques dealer Fischer-Böhler sold this exceptional seat furniture to the New York collector Emma A. Sheafer. At that time the chairs and settees were upholstered in eighteenth-century painted Chinese silk, and only the trelliswork carving on the outer backs of the side chairs was left uncovered. Mrs. Sheafer never knew the full splendor of the furniture that filled the dining room of her New York City apartment. It was with their painted silk show covers that the furniture came to the Museum as part of her bequest in 1973. Once the fabric had been taken off, a conservation campaign was undertaken. This included the reconstruction of the foliage around the inner edge of the frames, which had been cut away to accommodate the upholstery; the removal of later paint layers on the trelliswork; and the manufacture of seat cushions covered in velvet to match the originals.[15][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide 2006]Footnotes:[1] Much of the information in this entry is taken from Kisluk-Grosheide 1990.

They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, pp. 171–72.[8] See the inventories of 1802, room 57B, and 1817–18, p. 37, no. 2A, transcripts of which are kept in the archives at Schloss Seehof.[9] Linden wood was more often used for sculpture than for furniture during this period. Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, p. 169.[10] This was suggested by the Munich dealer Fischer-Böhler.[11] Kisluk-Grosheide 1990, pp. 156–57, fig. 23.[12] Heinrich Kreisel attributed the Würzburg settee to Johann Köhler, an otherwise unknown sculptor, who was paid for ""sculptural work [and/or] carving executed in the newly furnished chamber in the princely residence""; Kreisel 1930, pp. 29–30.

Close inspection reveals the high quality and intriguingly delicate structure of the paint and the fragility of the panels, which is not evident at  first glance. That the chair and settee have survived in such good condition is testimony to the technical skills of the maker, who provided a sound base for the heavy glass strips, preventing them from peeling away over time. Nevertheless, these are display pieces that were clearly not intended for regular use. The smallest body movement of a user or any attempt to shift or lift the heavy objects puts divergent forces and pressure on their ostentatious ""skin.""The Museum's chair and settee are part of a large suite that originally consisted of at least four settees and twenty side chairs.[1] Early in the twentieth century the set was in the collection of the earl of Derby, at Derby House, London, from where it was sold in 1940 to Mrs. Violet van der Elst, also of London. The pieces were dispersed in 1948.[2] At that time, all items of the suite were covered with the bold red and gold baroque-cut velvet that still decorates the Museum's pieces. For many years it was assumed that the initials ""PPL"" displayed in a medallion on the backs referred to the Villa Palagonia in Bagheria, near Palermo, and, more specifically, to a member of the illustrious Gravina family as a patron;[3] however, as James David Draper pointed out, although ""the peculiarly Sicilian penchant for fashioning an overall look out of glass was most memorably given free rein at the Villa Palagonia, . . . the initials 'PPL' . . . do not correspond with those of any prince of Palagonia and in truth the pieces have a much more pronounced neo-classical severity than the Villa Palagonia ballroom.""[4]John Richardson, the donor of the Museum's pieces, which he had acquired on the London art market, kept them at one point in the Château de Castille in Provence, the home of the Cubist scholar Douglas Cooper,[5] who himself owned at least three chairs from the set.[6] For the moment, the original location of the suite remains a mystery, although the preciousness and labor-intensive nature of the work narrows the source of the commission to one of the great, prosperous, aristocratic families of Sicily.The back of the settee is tripartite; the medallion with initials appears at the top of the center section, but in the same place on the side sections there is a military trophy in the form of a helmet superimposed on a saber. There is a gilded openwork frieze of overlapping ellipses along the top of the back of both the chair and the settee; this appears also along the bottom of the back of the settee but not on the Museum's chair. These ellipses, rather freely adapted from ancient vase paintings, reflect the so-called Etruscan fashion of the last third of the eighteenth century.[7] A very similar pair of chairs, each, however, with an octagonal verre églomisé panel set into the back in place of upholstery, is part of the collection of Juan March Ordinas at Palau March in Palma de Mallorca.[8] That those panels show a mythological chariot in the manner of an ancient vase painting is also very much in the ""Etruscan"" style. The incorporation of glass panels in the center of the backs makes the March chairs even more fragile than the Derby House suite.[9]Other pieces from this suite are preserved in the Art Institute of Chicago (two chairs),[10] the Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida (two settees and two chairs),[11] and the Museum für Kunsthandwerk, Frankfurt am Main (one chair),[12] as well as in various private collections. Some of them have been recovered in shell pink or blue gray fabric with the intention of intensifying the effect of the same shades painted on the glass.[Wolfram Koeppe 2006]Footnotes:[1] Catalogue of a sale at Christie, Manson, and Woods, London, 26 July 1940, lot 41 (sold to Mrs. Violet van der Elst).[2] Catalogue of the Violet van der Elst collection sale, Christie, Manson, and Woods, London, 8 April 1948, lot 114 (ill.).[3] Allen Wardwell.

They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, pp. 171–72.[8] See the inventories of 1802, room 57B, and 1817–18, p. 37, no. 2A, transcripts of which are kept in the archives at Schloss Seehof.[9] Linden wood was more often used for sculpture than for furniture during this period. Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, p. 169.[10] This was suggested by the Munich dealer Fischer-Böhler.[11] Kisluk-Grosheide 1990, pp. 156–57, fig. 23.[12] Heinrich Kreisel attributed the Würzburg settee to Johann Köhler, an otherwise unknown sculptor, who was paid for ""sculptural work [and/or] carving executed in the newly furnished chamber in the princely residence""; Kreisel 1930, pp. 29–30.

Kress (1863-1955). [1] It consisted of three embroidered wall hangings and various pieces of matched seat furniture that originally belonged to two different eighteenth-century suites, with the addition of several later pieces. [2] The wall hangings-chain-stitched embroideries in silk on a white silk-satin ground-show musical instruments, birds' nests, baskets of flowers, and sun hats linked together with swags of flowers. The present armchair and an identical example, as well as a pair of side chairs of the same design, have eighteenth-century show covers that were made to match these embroideries. In order to give the group of seat furniture a unified appearance, the remaining pieces were upholstered with portions cut from additional embroidered hangings that were sacrificed for this purpose.It is not entirely clear how such an illustrious provenance became attached to this assembled lot. When the settee, which dates to the nineteenth century, was published in 1927, nothing was said about its origin except, erroneously, that the eighteenth-century menuisier Georges Jacob had signed it. [3 In 1934, however, the author of a book on French furniture stated that the set had been made by Jacob for Marie Antoinette (1755-1793), and described it as ""one of the most beautiful examples of the talent of this master."" [4] Furthermore, he declared that the embroidery was the work of the queen and her ladies and that Marie Antoinette gave the entire set to Louis-Jean-Marie de Bourbon, duc de Penthièvre (1725-1793). [5]Stamped by Georges Jacob, who supplied much furniture to the court of Louis XVI (1754-1793), this armchair and its pair have straight, rectangular backs, which characterize them as fauteuils à la reine. When cutting the walnut frames, Jacob must have carefully taken into consideration the planned decoration, leaving enough wood to allow the unidentified but obviously very skilled carver to execute the designs. Particularly striking are the deeply undercut garlands of myrtle branches spiraling around a straight rod on the seat and back rails. Trails of berried myrtle branches are carved around the tapering shafts of the cylindrical legs, which are crowned by collars of laurel leaves and berries. Laurel leaves are also repeated on the front of the curving arm supports that terminate in acanthus-leaf volutes. A molding of pearls and twisted-rope motifs carved along the top of the seat rail gives a rhythmical effect not unlike that created by brass upholstery nails-here absent because the chairs are covered à châssis. The original slip seat and webbing have been preserved. The back panel, edge roll, arm pads, and comfortable down and feather seat cushion are all covered in the original late-eighteenth-century embroidered silk-satin. [6] The back displays floral branches framed by scrolling floral borders. The seat cushion shows a basket of flowers within similar borders. Certain motifs, such as the band of pearls along the fore edge of the seat as well as along the borders of the cushion and of the back, clearly relate to the carving of the wooden frame. The high quality of the once very colorful chain-stitched embroidery clearly identifies it as professional work rather than as the fruit of the queen's pastime. The elegant floral compositions are close to designs by the famed silk manufacturer Philippe de Lasalle (1723-1804/5).From a series of marks, inscriptions, and inventory numbers on the frames of both armchairs a considerable amount of information can be gleaned. [7] First of all, the incised roman numerals VII and VIII indicate that they were numbers seven and eight of a suite that included both arm- and side chairs, and possibly one or more settees. It was not unusual for a chairmaker to identify the various elements, especially such removable parts as slip seats and arm pads, as belonging to a certain chair, to avoid mixing them up.The French inscription ""de P[enthiè]vre Paris Chambre à Balus[tre]"" (and a variation of this) is enlightening as well, showing that the chairs were in the possession of the wealthy duc de Penthièvre, grand admiral of France and a cousin of Louis XVI. The set furnished his Paris residence, the Hôtel de Toulouse, an early-seventeenth-century building on the rue de la Vrillière, near the place des Victoires. By 1719 the architect Robert de Cotte (1656-1735) had renovated the mansion for the duc de Penthièvre's father, the comte de Toulouse.[8] The hôtel had, according to a late-eighteenth-century description, a chambre des balustres, or room with balustrade on the ground floor. [9] Used only on special occasions, this room was a chambre de parade, or ceremonial bedchamber. A curving balustrade, or estrade, seen in a plan by Jacques-François Blondel (1705-1774), closed off a bed alcove separating the state bed from the rest of the room . [10] To have such a balustrade was a privilege, allowed only in the state apartments of dukes, princes, and grands seigneurs. [11] The formal nature of the Museum's armchairs as so-called fauteuils meublants, placed along the wall and considered to be part of the interior decoration, reflects the official function of the room. Given the various other French inscriptions on the frames, it is possible that the chairs were also used in a different part of the house. It has been suggested that the entire set was placed in the first-floor apartment of the duke's widowed daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse-Louise, princesse de Lamballe (1749-1792), a friend of Marie Antoinette's. [12]After the duc de Penthièvre's death his only surviving daughter, Louise-Marie-Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre (1753-1821), inherited his possessions. Married to the liberal Louis-Philippe-Joseph, duc d'Orléans (1747-1793), who renounced his title and became known as Philippe-Égalité, she was widowed when he was guillotined during the Reign of Terror in 1793. She was exiled from France, and her property including the Hôtel de Penthièvre (Toulouse) was confiscated in 1797. The chairs may then have come into the possession of the banker Gabriel-Julien Ouvrard (1770-1846), whose name is written on stickers affixed to the slip seats. Having amassed a huge fortune in war speculations, Ouvrard became purveyor to the French navy in 1798. He apparently acquired several of the confiscated estates of the Orléans family that were, however, returned to them in 1814. The ""B125"" marks on the chairs probably refer to one of these properties, perhaps the eighteenth-century Château de Bizy, in Normandy, where the duc de Penthièvre died and his daughter lived after her return from exile. An inventory of the Château de Bizy described the Salon de Famille as furnished with hangings of white silk-satin embroidered with floral designs, and it listed a large set of seat furniture in the same room that was upholstered to match. This inventory was drawn up shortly after 1830, when the castle was in the possession of the son of Philippe-Égalité, Louis-Philippe (1773-1850), duc d'Orléans, who became king of France in 1830.The crowned, interlaced monogram ""LPO"" on the chairs clearly refers to his ownership, and he may have been responsible for uniting the two sets. It has been said that Louis-Philippe left the assembled seat furniture to his youngest daughter, Marie-Clémentine (1817-1907), who lived in Austria after her marriage to Prince Augustus of Saxe-Coburg. [13] Some years after her death, in September 1913, Duveen Brothers, the well-known antiques dealership with branches in London, Paris, and New York, acquired this set of furniture. [14]Notes:1 Duveen Brothers Records 1876-1981, Papers and Correspondence, 1901-81, box 475, f. 5 (microfilm, reel 330).2. In 1958 the pieces were a gift of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation to the Museum. They included two armchairs (acc. nos. 58.75.25,26) and two matching side chairs (58.75.33,34) all stamped by Georges Jacob. There were also two similar armchairs (58.75.30,31) and one small settee, or marquise (58.75.27), also by Jacob but part of another set. In addition, there were a settee (58.75.24), two armchairs (58.75.29,32), and a second marquise (58.75.28) executed at a later date to match the design of accession numbers 58.75.27,30,31.

This series included portraits of Louis XIV, his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, marquise de Montespan (1641 – 1707 ), and six of their children, all shown as deities. The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers. The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds. Various birds, insects, and wind instruments are rendered around this medallion, while a sunburst is shown above and Juno with peacock below. The closeness of the depiction of Louis XIV to an image of the king painted on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles by Charles Le Brun in 1683 – 84 makes it likely that the designs for the main figures in the set of hangings were supplied by his workshop; however, they may be the work of the painter François Bonnemer (1638 – 1689 ), who is known to have made cartoons after compositions by Le Brun. In 1685 Bonnemer provided designs for the embroidered seat covers of the benches and stools in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alentours, or decorative borders, full of delightful details, are believed to be by Jean Lemoyen le Lorrain, an artist little known today who worked in the circle of Le Brun.The other embroideries are thought to depict three of Montespan’s children with the king: Louise-Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes (1673 – 1743 ), with flowers symbolizing Flora, or spring (MMA 46.43.1); Françoise-Marie, Mademoiselle de Blois (1677 – 1749 ), with wheat ears, as Ceres, or summer (MMA 46.43.2); and Louis-Auguste, duc de Maine (1670 – 1736 ), in armor, as Mars, or fire (MMA 46.43.3).The compositions of the seasons include floral wreaths with the zodiac symbols for the appropriate months, while salamanders, torches, smoking braziers, and censers pertain to the element fire. The background of these rare surviving embroideries is worked in metal thread, now tarnished, which must have given them a sumptuous and shimmering appearance when they were first made. The hangings were documented in 1718 as in the collection of Louis-Alexandre, comte de Toulouse (1678 – 1737 ), the youngest child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, at the Château de Rambouillet. During the nineteenth century they belonged to King Louis-Philippe and were hung at the Palais Royal, Paris.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, adapted from The Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts/Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide and Jeffrey Munger; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This series included portraits of Louis XIV, his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, marquise de Montespan (1641 – 1707 ), and six of their children, all shown as deities. The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers. The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds.

The view from the house is delightful.— Harry Peckham, A Tour through Holland . . .and Part of FranceLouis XVI purchased the country residence of the duc d’Orléans a few miles west of Paris for Marie-Antoinette in 1785. Being in need of renovation, the palace was enlarged and altered for the queen, and many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené. A member of an important dynasty of Parisian chairmakers, Sené had been appointed menuisier to the Crown in 1784.A detailed 1788 description of this set, which also included four matching armchairs and a stool, indicates that the pieces were intended for one of Marie-Antoinette’s private rooms at Saint-Cloud, her Cabinet Particulier. The frame of the daybed, originally longer but shortened at a later date, is embellished with carving of ivy on the seat rail and garlands of roses along the crest rail. Ionic capitals surmount the short legs, and most remarkable of all are the Egyptian female half-figures on tapering supports that decorate the front stiles. Even though in his bill Sené called them simply caryatids, these figures clearly express the queen’s taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art, well before Napoléon’s North African campaign made it fashionable. Similar ornament is found on the bergère (a comfortable armchair upholstered between the arms and the seat ), which, in addition, has a medallion on top with Marie-Antoinette’s initials framed by myrtle branches and roses. The matching screen, however, displays classical female figures on its feet and top rail. Unfortunately, the identity of the sculptor is not known, but Louis-François Chatard is documented as having painted and gilded the wooden surfaces.The 1789 inventory of Saint-Cloud records the entire suite in the queen’s Cabinet de Toilette, or dressing room. Listed by its show covers, as was customary for seat furniture, the set is described as being upholstered in white cotton twill, embroidered with a small floral ornament in silk. Known to have worked on needlepoint projects all her life, Marie-Antoinette did the embroidery herself, which she executed in satin stitch. Modern replicas of the queen’s handiwork, including her interlaced monogram on the panel of the fire screen, grace the frames of the furniture today. The colorful floral embroidery on the light cotton ground conveys a sense of summer, the season Marie-Antoinette preferred to spend at Saint-Cloud.Epigraph.

The château, situated on a hillside overlooking the Seine not far from Paris, became the queen's favorite summer residence. Built in the sixteenth century and rebuilt during the seventeenth, the palacewas in need of renovation. The architect Richard Mique (1728-1794) enlarged and altered it, and appropriate furnishings were ordered for the queen's apartment.Many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sene (1748-1803), a member of an important dynasty of Parisian chair makers who received a royal appointment in 1784. Sene provided a set of seat furniture for the queen's dressing room, called her cabinet particulier ox cabinet de toilette that is described in the 1789 inventory of Saint Cloud. The daybed, the bergère (a comfortable chair upholstered between the arms and the seat), and the fire screen from the set are now in the Museum's collections (figs. 50?57). They were the gift of Ann Payne Blumenthal, the second wife of George Blumenthal. The painted and gilt frame of the low daybed (fig. 50) is embellished with floral motifs. Six short tapering and fluted legs surmounted by Ionic capitals support the piece. The front stiles of the head- and footboard, which are of equal height, are carved with female half-figures wearing Egyptian headdresses (fig. 51). The berg?re (fig. 52), which has a medallion with Marie Antoinette's initials on its top rail (fig. 53), is decorated in a similar manner. A decade before Napoleon's North African campaign was to inspire the fashion known as égyptomanie, the queen appears to have had a taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art. Seated classical female figures, rather than Egyptian caryatids, decorate the feet of the fire screen (figs. 54, 55), and a woman who once held a cornucopia reclines on its top. The carver is not known, but Louis-François Chatard (ca. 1749-1819) was responsible for painting and gilding the frames.According to the 1789 inventory the set was originally upholstered in a white-twilledcotton with rows of individual flowers embroidered by the queen herself. When the three pieces came to the Museum in 1941 only the fire screen's show cover (fig. 56)had survived. Although the cotton ground is much discolored, Marie Antoinette'sinterlaced initials, composed of blossoms embroidered in satin stitch, are in remarkably good condition (see fig. 57).","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This series included portraits of Louis XIV, his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, marquise de Montespan (1641 – 1707 ), and six of their children, all shown as deities. The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers. The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds. Various birds, insects, and wind instruments are rendered around this medallion, while a sunburst is shown above and Juno with peacock below. The closeness of the depiction of Louis XIV to an image of the king painted on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles by Charles Le Brun in 1683 – 84 makes it likely that the designs for the main figures in the set of hangings were supplied by his workshop; however, they may be the work of the painter François Bonnemer (1638 – 1689 ), who is known to have made cartoons after compositions by Le Brun. In 1685 Bonnemer provided designs for the embroidered seat covers of the benches and stools in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alentours, or decorative borders, full of delightful details, are believed to be by Jean Lemoyen le Lorrain, an artist little known today who worked in the circle of Le Brun.The other embroideries are thought to depict three of Montespan’s children with the king: Louise-Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes (1673 – 1743 ), with flowers symbolizing Flora, or spring (MMA 46.43.1); Françoise-Marie, Mademoiselle de Blois (1677 – 1749 ), with wheat ears, as Ceres, or summer (MMA 46.43.2); and Louis-Auguste, duc de Maine (1670 – 1736 ), in armor, as Mars, or fire (MMA 46.43.3).The compositions of the seasons include floral wreaths with the zodiac symbols for the appropriate months, while salamanders, torches, smoking braziers, and censers pertain to the element fire. The background of these rare surviving embroideries is worked in metal thread, now tarnished, which must have given them a sumptuous and shimmering appearance when they were first made. The hangings were documented in 1718 as in the collection of Louis-Alexandre, comte de Toulouse (1678 – 1737 ), the youngest child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, at the Château de Rambouillet. During the nineteenth century they belonged to King Louis-Philippe and were hung at the Palais Royal, Paris.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, adapted from The Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts/Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide and Jeffrey Munger; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

As such, the animal seen here likely represents the Buddhist six-tusked elephant described in a fifth-century Chinese translation of a sutra as being resplendent and white and having lotuses, jade maidens, and other symbolic figures at the end of each tusk.²Elephants have a long history in China. Given as tribute to the emperor by local rulers, particularly from neighboring Southeast Asian regions where they were raised, elephants were also presented as diplomatic gifts to important foreign kings. Apart from their use as work animals and army transport, they were sometimes tamed to provide entertainment in times of leisure, beloved by the royal courts. In sixteenth-century Europe, elephants held a similar fascination for royals and commoners alike, and they appear in the works of such artists as Durer and Raphael. Shipped by boat from Ceylon to Lisbon, elephants were offered as gifts of the Portuguese kings to the courts of Spain, Austria, France, and England. In 1514, Manuel I of Portugal gave a white elephant (the famous ""Hanno"" known through Raphael's drawings) to Pope Leo X.  An  elephant given by the court of Lisbon to Philip II of Spain in 1581 was subsequently passed along to Henry IV of France.  A year later Henry, in turn, gve it to Queen Elizabeth of England, a brillia;nt ""re-gifting"" of an asset deemed too expensive to maintain.³ Here the combination of Buddhist symbols and Habsburg eagles produces a composite message of a religious and political nature that juxtaposes the two cultures of Asia and Europe.  We do not know how long this long-preserved length of fabric was originally used, but its delicate quality indicates that it may have been part of a garment or hanging.⁴Woven in China and likely exported through the port of Macau, this textile's blend of Asian and European taste and style was intended for a foreign market that may not have understood the Buddhist elements but nonetheless would have appreciated the fine weaving and exotic designs.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1. The textile is composed of a five-harness satin damask, with a blue warp and yellow weft. The blue color is presumably indigo, while the yellow dye was made from the Asian pagoda tree (Sophora japonica). Dye analysis was conducted by Nobuko Shibayama in the Department of Scientific Research, Metropolitan Museum, with High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Photo Diode Array (HPLC-PDA). 2. “The creature is colossal . . . and is whiter than the snows of the Himalayas. At the ends of his six tusks are six bathing tanks, in each of which grow fourteen lotuses. On each open blossom is a ‘jade maiden’ fairer than the damsels of Paradise, in whose hands are five spontaneously created lutes; each lute is accompanied by 500 other musical instruments, and 500 jewel-colored birds.” Guan Puxian pu sa xing fa jing (Sutra on the Practice of Visualizing the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra), in Soper, “Literary Evidence for Early Buddhist Art in China,” p. 223. 3.

The panel comprises two widths of cloth seamed together: identical patterns that are somewhat mismatched at the join. A fragment of the white selvage with a blue stripe is preserved along the seam in two areas (visible at the back). Digby, “Some Silks Woven under Portuguese Influence in the Far East,” pp. 55 ? 56 and n. 11, notes that several Asian damasks from Macau have a white twill selvage with a stripe and that the structure of this selvage is distinct from other silks thought to be from Macau; the elephant silk conforms to the technical features of that group. Since we have little information as to the exact provenance of these textiles, technical features such as these can be important for identifying the potential locale of their production.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/damask"

Its original but now fragile hangings, woven in 1782–83 at the Beauvais tapestry manufactory after designs by Jean-Baptiste Huet (1745–1811), have been replaced by modern silk damask, except for the lining of the interior dome. French eighteenth-century beds tended to be lofty, as it was customary to pile them with three or more mattresses filled with straw, wool, horsehair, or feathers. Tobias Smollett (1721–1771) noted in 1766, “French beds are so high, that sometimes one is obliged to mount them by the help of steps.”[1]The custom of receiving visitors while reposing in a large and elegantly fitted out bed was practiced in France during the eighteenth century mostly by aristocratic women. The Museum’s imposing piece of furniture with its exquisitely carved floral decoration, the work of an unknown carver, must have formed a splendid backdrop for such official calls or congratulatory visits. In 1791 the bed is documented as standing in the large bedchamber of Guyonne-Marguerite de Durfort de Lorge, duchesse de Choiseul-Praslin (1737–1806), at her Parisian home, the Hôtel de Belle Isle. Following the turmoil of the Revolution and the political changes of the early nineteenth century, the bed was sold in Paris in 1830. It became part of the famous collections at Hamilton Palace, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the residence of Alexander Hamilton Douglas, tenth Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852), where it was placed in one of the state rooms. The duke’s grandson sold the contents of the palace, including the bed, at a highly anticipated auction that took place in 1882. Through the intermediation of several dealers, the bed was acquired in 1897 by the financier and railroad executive George J. Gould (1864–1923). His wife, the former actress Edith M. Kingdon (1864–1921), used it in her bedroom of their New York town house.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010]Footnotes:[1] Tobias George Smollett. Travels through France and Italy. London, 1766.

Later, the precious bedcover was cut up, and portions were pieced together with a delicate quilted European floral silk to create the panel as it appears today.¹ Its relatively small size indicates that it may have served as a christening or bearing cloth for a child being carried to the baptismal font for christening.²  At the very center of the textile are three bands from the original coverlet, one with a roundel containing a scene of a man and a woman flanking a tree, perhaps inspired by traditional depictions of Adam and Eve. The blossoming tree grows from a large container decorated with a continuous pattern of hexagons, a Chinese design suggesting longevity, and on the tree is a bleeding heart pierced with arrows, a secular symbol referring to love and devotion in Renaissance Europe.³ The dress of the couple is generally consistent with that of late sixteenth to early seventeenth century Europe: the woman’s unstructured clothing is typical of the early seventeenth century, while the man’s hat conforms to late sixteenth-century examples.⁴ Their garments are overembroidered with repeating Chinese patterns, as if made to resemble Chinese silk damasks. The two other adjoining bands at the center of the panel were formerly one. If placed one directly above the other, they form a scene with a pair of ducks in a lotus pond. Although the lotus pond is an enduring theme in Chinese textiles, here the pattern shows a heightened emphasis on flower centers, common in Chinese export textiles, and another type of duck has been substituted for the pair of egrets or mandarin ducks more frequently found in a traditional Chinese image. Another part of the original coverlet was retained as the embroidered border of the present panel; while its sides were heavily pieced together, the ninety-degree corners were untouched in the piecing process, indicating that it served as a border in the original coverlet as well. The delicate, light peach-colored European textile chosen to surround the exotic portions of the cloth has a floral pattern typical of the last decades of the seventeenth century.⁵ The panel is fully lined in a white monochrome woven silk with a small floral pattern on a continuous fretwork background likely woven in China. Cloth of this type, termed rinzu, was exported from China to Japan in large quantities during the seventeenth century to be used as the foundation fabric of luxurious dyed and embroidered Japanese kimonos, until the Japanese started producing it themselves in the mid-Edo period, starting in the 1680s.⁶[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1.

The Queen of France sat in the balcony in front of the Thuilleries, appeared serious, and our party remarked, that she looked like a very handsome English woman. As soon as the aëronauts had taken their flight, I quitted the gardens.""[1] In his diary entry for December 1, 1783, Joseph Cradock (1742–1826) refers to the many spectators who watched a historic event take place that day: the first manned hydrogen balloon flight. The aeronauts Jacques-Alexandre-César Charles (1746–1823), a physicist, and his collaborator, Marie-Noël Robert (1760–1820), took off from the gardens of the Tuileries in a gondola suspended from a netted hydrogen balloon.Balloon-shaped and carved with netting, the finials of these side chairs, supplied for the queen’s boudoir at the Château des Tuileries in February 1784, celebrate Charles and Robert’s successful flight. Georges Jacob, one of the outstanding menuisiers of the ancien régime, provided the walnut frames, which he described as “of a new shape,” possibly referring to the arched top rail or the seat shaped like a horseshoe. The brothers Rousseau, who were decorative painters as well as sculptors, executed the delicate carving, each element of which is carefully detailed in their 1784 invoice.

It is described as a weave structure with characteristics that correspond to those of many so-called lace-pattern silks of the 1720s. The principal feature of this fabric was, according to the author, Antoine Nicolas Joubert de l’Hiberderie, the juxtaposition of two contrasting foundation weaves—a dark or boldly colored satin weave and a white plain weave—that were augmented by brocading in additional colors of silk and possibly one or more metallic threads.¹  It is unclear in Le dessinateur whether persienne was a purely technical term or whether it also described a style. In addition to the technical definition given in the 1765 publication, evidence that persienne referred to a style as well as a structure is provided by labels inscribed on the drawings of such designs dating between 1723 and 1730.²  The serrated leaves and rather stiff drawing of the flowers on the present silk piece reflect both Ottoman and Indo-Persian floral designs. In its weave, the silk adheres to the technical definition of a persienne, while suggesting a debt to the art and architecture of the Islamic world in its use of the mihrab-shaped compartments that frame the central plant motif. So, while this distinctive type of silk, made in the weaving centers of France, England, and the Netherlands, is now referred to as ""lace patterned"" owing to its lacy ribbonlike motifs, the eighteenth-century term might serve just as well. This type of vibrantly colored floral silk was used in both men’s and women’s fashions, including a number of men's banyans. That this textile was a product of European looms did not diminish the exotic properties that made it appropriate for leisure wear, just as the so-called bizarre silks were in earlier decades (see MMA 64.35.1). These European silks also spawned Indian chintz designs that were created both for the European market, like a chintz panel in the Museum's collection (see MMA 36.90.121), and for sale closer to the Indian subcontinent, such as a long cloth made for the Indonesian market in the Museum's collection (see MMA 2011.44). The subdued monochrome palette of the chintz panel may have meant that it was intended for mourning wear, the colors of which gradually shifted from black to increasingly lighter shades of blue and the eventual addition of red during the period of observance.³ European fashions in silk design changed rapidly, so it is probably safe to assume that any chintzes made to imitate popular Western patterns were produced fairly quickly so as not to be outdated before they arrived in Europe. However, these patterns might have had a longer life span in markets in the East.

The same type of design-large flowers and scrolling leaves symmetrically arranged to cover the entire width of a textile-also appears in monochrome damasks of the period.Velvet is distinguished from other flat textiles by its pile weave. This texture was created by an extra warp, in addition to the warp necessary for the background of the fabric. The pile warps were passed over small rods to create the loops of the pile. A polychrome velvet required as many extra sets of warps as it had colors in the pile, in this case four colors of velvet pile on a white satin background. Jardinière velvets usually had a combination of cut and uncut loops, giving further texture to the design.

It was part of the insignia of office of its custodian, the Keeper of the Great Seal (a post often contained within that of the Lord High Chancellor) and one of the most elaborate symbols associated with that high office. The king’s Great Seal was attached to all writs, letters patent, charters, and royal proclamations and was the ultimate symbol of royal authority. Something of the aura that attached to the physical object may be seen in the sense of responsibility its keepers felt in its safekeeping. When a Thomas Sadler broke into the house of the chancellor, Lord Finch, and stole the mace and burse on February 7, 1677, he failed to take the Great Seal itself, as Lord Finch kept it under his pillow.The present example dates from the reign of the first Hanoverian king, George I, and although the coat of arms would be particular to each monarch, the general form and decoration had been established earlier. A portrait of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, dated 1579 and housed in a private collection, shows him with an embroidered burse heavy with metal thread on a red velvet ground, with the monarch’s coat of arms and initials, foliate borders, and applied tassels, which is the same in essence as the Hanoverian example. The burse of Elizabeth I’s last Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Sir Thomas Egerton (appointed 1596–1603), which is today in the British Museum, is also centered by the queen’s coat of arms flanked by a lion and a Welsh dragon rampant, surmounted by the letters E.R. and bordered by scrolling foliage. This pattern was followed in succeeding examples, evident in the burse held by Sir Orlandus Bridgeman, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal between 1667 and 1672, in the engraving by William Faithorne. One of the ceremonial uses of the burse was to be carried in procession at shoulder height by the Lord High Chancellor preceding the monarch. The burse of Francis North, Baron Guildford (1637–1685), appointed Lord Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal in 1682, survives today in the Burrell Collection.Given its symbolic purpose, the burse was made from the finest and most precious of materials by royal embroiderers and therefore represents the pinnacle of professional embroidery of the period. As such, it displays a veritable catalogue of different uses of metal thread, couching techniques, and appliqué. These techniques are also to be found on heralds’ tabards, robes of state, and other greater and lesser articles of ceremony, and were used in varying levels of detail, relief, and material according to a judicious hierarchy of workmanship that was attached to works made for court ceremonial. The embroidery is almost sculptural in character. The applied raised work in high relief is well dispersed throughout the composition of the square bag, comprising the main decorative elements: the Royal Hanoverian coat of arms at the center, the lion and unicorn rampant on plinths, an orb at the bottom center, and winged putti’s heads punctuating the corners and middle of the sides of the border. All of these elements are composed of couched metal threads of varying width, tone, and form to create a variety of contrasting textures. The colors are concentrated around a palette of gold, silver, and crimson, traditionally associated with English royalty since the time of William the Conqueror (whose arms are included on the first half of the upper left quartering of the coat of arms on the burse, the ""three lions passant gardant or""). The texture achieved by virtue of tightly coiled silver purl in the unicorn’s muzzle or the sinuous undulating ribcage of the lion’s chest demonstrates the skill in manipulating metal threads to give the impression of the natural fall of groomed fur.The arms themselves are those of King George I. To the existing royal arms of the quartered fleurs-de-lis of France, rampant red lion of Scotland, lions passant of England, and harp of Ireland, the Hanoverian arms have been included in the lower left quadrant: two lions passant for Brunswick, harts and a blue lion rampant for Lüneburg, and a white or silver horse for Westphalia. Over this is a diminutive escutcheon with the crown of Charlemagne, an emblem associated with George I’s title as Arch-Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire. In the course of his reign, George I appointed three Lord High Chancellors, and so there are three possible possessors of this burse: William Cowper, 1st Baron Talbot of Hensol (1714–18), Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke (1718–25), and Peter King, 1st Baron King (1725–33). The extravagant three-dimensionality of the burse shows the continued flourishing of professional embroidery at court into the eighteenth century.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The valance depicts scenes from courtly life, but the precise narrative has not been identified. Yvonne Hackenbroch titled this piece ""The Education of Princess Elizabeth I"" mainly because of the young child with the man in classical garb, said to be a depiction of Elizabeth I’s tutor, Roger Ascham, but there is no other iconography to support this reading. The embroidery could simply illustrate the daily activities of ladies at court, although the interaction of the various figures implies the existence of a specific sequence of events.One possible iconographical reading lies in the identification of contemporary female personifications of the Five Senses. Reading from left to right, the woman gazing into the mirror may personify Sight; the woman with a falcon gesturing toward the young girl may personify Touch; the woman in profile in front of the fountain may represent Smell as she bends toward a potted flower; and the women playing musical instruments would represent Hearing. However, there is no obvious personification of the sense of taste. Additionally, the older man ushering a young girl toward the woman with the falcon, the presence of the jester, and the woman on horseback suggest that a specific narrative is intended.The valance can be compared to other valances and panels with unidentified narratives; similar scenes with equally opaque narratives involving costumed figures and garden settings, for example, are on two valances in the Musée de la Renaissance, Château d’Écouen, documented by Maria-Anne Privat-Savigny in 2003. These hunting and court scenes are interspersed with dramatically posed figures, such as a woman begging on her knees and two decapitations. Other valances and decorative panels of tent stitch illustrate biblical or mythological tales and, more rarely, historical events.Valances of this type have generally been dated to the late sixteenth century, based in part on the attire of the figures and the woven textile patterns that correspond to those found in extant textiles from the period. The clothing closely relates to costume prints from such books as Cesare Vecellio’s Habiti Antichi e Moderni di Diversi Parti del Mondo (1590) and Pierre Bertelli’s Habits des Diverses Nations (1594); these depictions (the first fashion plates) of the dress of various classes and cultures appear to have circulated widely throughout Europe. The use of tent stitch on canvas appeared in England by the middle of the sixteenth century, although it was practiced earlier in France. Santina Levey credits this technique’s introduction to English furnishing textiles to the influence of the French court. It is difficult, therefore, to attribute definitively many of these designs to one place of manufacture, when they were clearly produced in France, Scotland, and England, based on many of the same sources.This panel was most likely one of a set of bed valances intended to decorate the edges of a tester that hung over a bed in order to cover the attachment points of the bed curtains. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the bed was one of the most important pieces of furniture in the household. The finest sets of hangings would have included embroidered inner and outer valances, curtains, a tester, and a counterpane, in addition to embroidered pillows. Embroidered valances were also used to decorate the tops of walls, typically over a wall surface covered in textiles.[Elyse Gerstenecker, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

A quintessential account in the Western classical tradition, the story of the Trojan War inspired large sets of European tapestries; the earliest documented set was presented to Charles the Bold in 1472.¹ This embroidered hanging, too, was part of a large set, of which the Metropolitan Museum owns three, and four are preserved in other collections.² All have the same border, including an armorial at each corner that does not correspond completely with any known arms. Perhaps it is an erroneous rendering of the arms of the Mascarenhas family of Portugal; the nobleman Francisco Mascarenhas served as governor of Macau from 1623 to 1626. The abduction of Helen ignited war between Troy and Greece; this version, in which Helen is forcibly seized, relies on postclassical sources.³ Against a backdrop of European-style buildings with Baroque facades and struggling armored figures, a protesting Helen is carried off by two men, away from her white-bearded husband, Menelaus, and toward a boat on the right where the Trojan prince Paris awaits. No single print source has yet been found, but the subject matter and composition of the hanging were surely based on European sources.⁴The Chinese embroiderers were responsible for many details from the Chinese decorative vocabulary, such as the waves in the background, the phoenixes in the center of the upper border, various details of the armor, the scales of the serpents and tritons in the border, and the lychee fruit seen outlined against the side of the boat. While most of the hanging is embroidered, the figures’ faces and exposed limbs were painted directly on the cotton foundation cloth, probably also in China. Especially in the faces, the modeling of light and shadow for a three-dimensional effect, while naively done, shows an aspect of European-style painting that had reached East Asia with Jesuit missionaries in the sixteenth century. The Italian Jesuit Giovanni Niccolo (or Nicolao, 1563–1626) established an academy of painting in Japan in 1583 to train local artists to produce religious art. When the missionaries’ relations with Japanese authorities deteriorated, Niccolo fled Japan, returning to Macau in 1614. Some of his students became active in China, including You Wenhui (baptized Manoel Pereira, 1575–1633), a young Chinese from Macau, and Ni Yicheng (also known as Jacopo Niva, 1579–1635), of Japanese and Chinese parentage. You Wenhui produced the only surviving painted portrait of the Jesuit leader Matteo Ricci (1552–1610).⁵ The more highly regarded Ni Yicheng had studied at Niccolo’s academy in Japan, and in China he ""was in constant demand to paint works . . . both for the mission in China and the Jesuits’ church in Macau.""⁶ Perhaps these artists or less well-documented colleagues were responsible for painting this textile.  Scientific analysis of the hanging’s pigments supports this intercultural possibility: results show a blue-green pigment not used in Asia and a white not used in Europe. Furthermore, the white pigment occurs more frequently in Japanese than in Chinese contexts.⁷[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1.

Originally part of a much larger ensemble (thirty-six roundels and panels are now dispersed among public and private collections), the embroideries may have decorated a liturgical vestment, an altar frontal, or possibly a combination thereof, constituting a set of vestments. Having left the Roman army, Martin devoted himself to religious life and became a disciple of Saint Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers in France. Saint Martin is portrayed kneeling before the Bishop, who is ordaining him as acolyte. This series of embroideries, if not originally intended for a liturgical garment, may have embellished an altar frontal, similar to the blue covering that appears here on the altar behind the kneeling figure of Martin.

The proportions of this example indicate that it was used over a table rather than on a bed. The floral designs—elegant Renaissance-style scrolling vines with carnations, irises, and other flowers as well as hummingbirds seeking nectar—are constructed with brilliant yellow silk embroidered on a natural linen ground (outlines in brown tannin ink, drawn for the embroiderers to follow, are still visible in some areas). The golden yellow color, a favorite in Iberia for textiles, was derived from weld, a local dyeplant that thrived in the region and was relied on for its brilliance and durability.¹ Although the contrast between the yellow silk and the ecru ground echoes that of certain Indian embroideries made in Bengal and imported into Portugal and Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (see MMA1975.4, MMA 23.203.1), the ease of the design and the variety in stitch type (including satin, chain, and stem as well as various kinds of knots and filling stitches) help identify this as a European cover. The configuration of the cover’s decorative elements constitutes a basic format that may have originated in Islamic Spain. In particular, the large central field with a series of outer borders, including a broad center border flanked, or ""protected,"" by narrower guard borders on either side, was an established style for carpets throughout the Islamic world and one that influenced other regional textile designs, notably Spanish embroidery (the demarcation of the four outer corners in this example may, however, be more Iberian than Islamic in character). This design approach, in turn, was transmitted around the world via Spanish and Portuguese colonial administration and trade, from tapestries made by Andean weavers in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Peru (see MMA 56.163) to Asian and Indian embroideries intended for the European market (see MMA 1975.208d). Given the shared heritage of Portugal and Spain, especially during the sixteenth century, when both countries were united under a single ruler, it can be difficult to differentiate the embroidery production of one from the other.² Both regions had longstanding traditions of fine textiles, from folk works to commissions made by professional guilds for the Church and royal court. This example lies somewhere in between: although the cover was intended for actual household use, its intricate style and high quality suggest that it was made for a person of means and status.

The front cover shows Elijah and the Widow of Zarapeth (1 Kings 17:8–16), and the back cover shows Elijah Fed by Ravens (1 Kings 17:1–6), two episodes in the life of the prophet when God provided for him by sending sustenance from unlikely sources, ravens and a poor widow. Although not as common as other biblical scenes rendered in needlework, the numerous depictions of the story of Elijah in paintings and engravings show how familiar these stories would have been to their seventeenth-century audience. Yvonne Hackenbroch suggested a likely source for the front of the embroidered cover in Gerard de Jode’s late sixteenth-century Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamentis, although some of the costumes were updated from this source to reflect contemporary fashion.Two factors lead to the conclusion that this decorated binding is the work of an amateur: the level of proficiency of the embroiderer and the presence of initials, presumably those of the maker. The techniques and materials employed are fewer and simpler than are commonly seen on Bible covers of a professional caliber; the two scenes from the life of Elijah are worked in tent stitch on canvas, which would have been made separately and then applied to the satin background of the book binding. The scenes are then framed in a cartouche of silk-wrapped purl thread, which is applied in a couching technique that would be relatively simple to work. A knot stitch is used on the satin background to make the floral border and the maker’s initials M.B., as well as the spine, which is covered in six registers of flora and fauna. Although tedious to work in this quantity, the stitch is not terribly difficult. The fact that this Bible and Book of Psalms were decorated by an amateur embroiderer shows that the skills so important to a young woman’s education were put to use in the making of decorative objects necessary to a properly appointed household.Like cabinets decorated with raised-worked panels, the finished cover would probably have been delivered, along with the book itself, to a binder who specialized in the application of decorative covers. The same craftsman may have applied the decorative silver metal trim to the edges, as well as the gold metal clasps. The publication date of a book cannot be used as conclusive evidence for the date of any type of cover. However, it is probable that books intended to receive decorative textile covers were intentionally constructed with smooth spines, in order to facilitate the application of the cover and to avoid interrupting the design, unlike the spines with protruding cords, which are commonly found on leather bound books of the period. Nevertheless, the embroidery design on the spine imitates the appearance of leather bindings with the horizontal cords and panels in between.[Katy Reed-Basham and Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Wool was commonly used for tent stitch or needlework on canvas from the sixteenth century, but this fiber is unusual in pictorial works such as this. Wool is more commonly found on bed furnishings of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries on a cotton twill foundation fabric.The presence of initials and a date probably indicate that this was an amateur production in both design and execution. The composition, which is extraordinarily crowded and naive, even within the genre of seventeenth-century pictures, is a small compendium of religious imagery, each story rendered in a kind of shorthand with only the key scene in the narrative nestled within the pictorial landscape conventions of this type. Hagar and Ishmael, banished from the home of Abraham, exit the scene in the lower left corner, while the princess of Egypt finds the baby Moses to the right. The river that delivered Moses flows from a rocky grotto, home to a mermaid, several types of fantastic fish, and a duck. Above the mermaid’s head at the right, Rebecca offers a drink to Eliezer from an antique urn on which the date 1667 is embroidered. The identity of the king under the central canopy is not certain, but he most likely represents Solomon sitting in judgment, as a woman appears to be pleading for a child in the arms of a cavalier with a sword. This interpretation is strengthened by the presence of a colorful moth or butterfly below the king. If we accept this as a symbol of the restoration of the Stuart monarchy, then the biblical Solomon, with whom King Charles I (father of the contemporary king) had been identified, would have been an appropriate choice. The rest of the panel is populated with flora and fauna, rendered with a typical disregard for relative scale, and a stately home with two small faces behind the mica windows.

Unlike other gloves of the time, which have separately constructed and highly decorated gauntlets that appear far too fragile to wear, this pair would have been relatively functional.These gloves were said to have belonged to James I, primarily because of the presence of the Scottish thistle in the embroidery, but there is no conclusive evidence of this connection. This attribution was first asserted by W. B. Redfern in 1904 and repeated by Frances Morris in 1929. As an insignia of royalty after James’s accession to the English throne, the thistle motif was usually combined with the Tudor rose to represent the union of England and Scotland under one ruler, as on an early seventeenth-century embroidered cushion cover with the royal arms surmounted by a large rose and two small stylized thistles, now held in the Victoria and Albert Museum.Beginning in the late sixteenth century, gloves play an increasingly visible role in portraiture, and their functions were practical as well as symbolic. This pair may be similar to the type of leather glove with metallic thread fringe described in the wardrobes of both sons of James I, as described in surviving inventories and bills for both princes’ wardrobes. Accounts from about 1608 for Henry, Prince of Wales, included ""four pair of staggs leather gloves, perfumed and fringed with gold and silver fringe, at 16s."" And his younger brother, Charles, when he was king, ordered similar gloves in even larger quantities during the 1630s: ""2 dozen pairs of thick stags lether gloues with gold and silver fringes."" Charles I is also depicted wearing a similar pair of gloves of gray-brown leather with embroidered gauntlets and metallic thread fringe in Daniel Mytens’s 1629 portrait of the king (MMA, 06.1289).[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This graphic effect is particularly apparent in the brick stitch used as the ground in the border around the oval frame. It is unusual that the embroiderer has adopted the printmakers’ and painters’ convention of signing his work at the bottom of the image: ""R. Hayes Fecit."" This claim to professional status makes it likely that R. Hayes was indeed a professional embroiderer, and this is consistent with the evenness of stitching. It is most evident in the rendering of Charles’s flowing hair, where the embroiderer has articulated the graceful ringlets by twisting the silk floss at the tips of the gathered curl to create a play of light that closely approaches the nature of human hair.The embroidery is derived from a popular image of Charles I, which was made after his execution and exists in at least two prints: an engraving by Edward Bower, published by Robert Preeke in 1649, and an etching produced by Wenceslaus Hollar in the same year (MMA, 17.50.85). Although Yvonne Hackenbroch suggests the former as the direct print source for this embroidery, it is in fact closer to the Hollar version, in the exact transcription of the pose, in the king’s size and position relative to the oval surround, and in such details as the gloved hand and the cloak embroidered with the emblem of the Order of the Garter. John Peacock has posited that the Hollar portrait drew upon the painted portrait of Charles I Wearing the Garter Star of about 1632 by Anthony van Dyck and an ""idiosyncratic"" etching of Charles I by George Lid, published as a frontispiece of A Continuation of Lucan of 1630. From the former, he derived the general disposition of pose and details of costume, including the emblazoned Garter Star, and from the latter, the idea of showing the king wearing a broad-brimmed hat. That Charles wears the hat in several posthumous prints and in the embroidered portrait is a probable reference to his attire in court, when, as Hackenbroch pointed out, ""Charles declined to take his hat off during the trials lest this gesture be interpreted as a sign of respect towards his Judges."" In the embroidered portrait, this reference, combined with an aureole of light emanating from behind him, confers upon the image of the king both the specificity of an historical memory and an iconic aura appropriate to its commemorative function.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Originally, these curtains may have been part of a larger suite of furnishings for the decoration of an entire bedroom–a canape (settee) now in the private rooms of Madame de Maintenon at Fontainebleau has very similar embroidered designs.¹ The complete set of bed hangings probably included matching upper valances for the tester, lower valances for the frame supporting the mattresses, and a coordinating bedcover and headcloth, like the set of French bedroom furnishings now in the Metropolitan Museum (see MMA 53.2.1a-d, .2a-d). Oversize fanciful flora, a design element familiar from the so-called bizarre silks, are joined in these curtains by human figures dressed in vaguely Chinese garments, imaginary Asian winged dragons, and pairs of long-tailed birds. Early chinoiseriestyle furnishings, made in sturdy tent and cross stitches on canvas, were used over a wide geographic area in northern Europe during the first half of the eighteenth century, and a good number have survived.² The Metropolitan’s side curtains, with their yellow background, are most likely French, as extant examples of the yellow or pale backgrounds are associated with production or use in France. To date, no documentation regarding the commission or production for these various suites of furnishings has been discovered, though we know that another such group was probably ordered from Paris in 1721 for Favorite Palace in Ludwigsburg, Germany, the summer residence of Sybilla Augusta, margravine of Baden-Baden (1675–1733).³ Most of these embroideries, however, were worked on a dark background, either blue or black, and are therefore more closely connected with the aesthetic of English tapestries from the likes of John Vanderbank, with their reference to the dark backgrounds of Asian lacquer screens (see MMA 53.165.2). No design drawings or sources have been identified for these embroideries, which, like the Vanderbank tapestries, are decorative pastiches probably taking inspiration from the same variety of sources employed by contemporary tapestry designers, including imported fabrics and their European counterparts, the bizarre silks.⁴ A feature of Chinese art that confounded and intrigued European observers is very much present in these embroideries. Writers from the late seventeenth and well into the eighteenth century remarked on the asymmetry that was prevalent in Chinese design and architecture, as opposed to the preference for symmetry and pleasing proportion in Western taste.⁵ These early chinoiserie embroideries embody the attempt to capture the beautiful disorder"" that Europeans found so irresistible.

In the early seventeenth century they also fetched high prices at auctions in England and seem to have influenced the production of embroidery there (see MMA 34.104.1 and MMA 1970.173). Characterized by the use of yellow tussah silk embroidery on a white cotton ground, they typically depict a combination of classical, biblical, and Hindu themes, although a few draw from other sources (see e.g. Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, no. T20e4). This colcha is embellished with a selection of vignettes found on several others, including an almost identical example in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon.² Successive bands around the border depict a hunt, the Labors of Hercules, and the story of Arion, while the center panel features the Judgment of Solomon surrounded by stories from the book of Judith: the siege of Bethulia (bottom right), Judith before Holofernes (top right), Judith beheads Holofernes (top left), and the severed head of Holofernes displayed from the walls of Bethulia (bottom left). Vignettes from classical mythology include Actaeon transformed into a stag by Diana (above the Solomon scene), Hercules shooting the Lernean Hydra (detail), and the story of Phaeton, who drove the chariot of the sun too close to Earth, scorching the planet and causing the animals to die (in the triangular panel below Hercules). While the themes of these coverlets can be generally related to contemporary European tapestries and textiles, which also mix biblical and classical tales, the depiction of the protagonists in seventeenth-century Portuguese garb and the addition of Hindu imagery (such as the story of the Vishnu avatar Matsya, the fishtailed figure in the second band from the center) must represent the traditions and imagination of the embroiderers who created them. The circulation of northern European prints and illustrated Bibles at the Mughal court is well documented, but the sources available to the Bengali embroiderers remain obscure and probably represent an entirely different category of material. The inventiveness of the embroidery is further underscored by comparison to those made for the local market. Two pieces that likely date to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century are embroidered in multicolored silk, and their design is composed of circular medallions enclosing lotus patterns, interlocking star shapes, and bands of human figures and animals.³ Here, then, the switch to an almost monochrome yellow and white palette, the composition of concentric panels and bands, and the addition of foreign iconography were innovations for this particular type of export, which was produced only until the mid-seventeenth century.

It was part of the insignia of office of its custodian, the Keeper of the Great Seal (a post often contained within that of the Lord High Chancellor) and one of the most elaborate symbols associated with that high office. The king’s Great Seal was attached to all writs, letters patent, charters, and royal proclamations and was the ultimate symbol of royal authority. Something of the aura that attached to the physical object may be seen in the sense of responsibility its keepers felt in its safekeeping. When a Thomas Sadler broke into the house of the chancellor, Lord Finch, and stole the mace and burse on February 7, 1677, he failed to take the Great Seal itself, as Lord Finch kept it under his pillow.The present example dates from the reign of the first Hanoverian king, George I, and although the coat of arms would be particular to each monarch, the general form and decoration had been established earlier. A portrait of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, dated 1579 and housed in a private collection, shows him with an embroidered burse heavy with metal thread on a red velvet ground, with the monarch’s coat of arms and initials, foliate borders, and applied tassels, which is the same in essence as the Hanoverian example. The burse of Elizabeth I’s last Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Sir Thomas Egerton (appointed 1596–1603), which is today in the British Museum, is also centered by the queen’s coat of arms flanked by a lion and a Welsh dragon rampant, surmounted by the letters E.R. and bordered by scrolling foliage. This pattern was followed in succeeding examples, evident in the burse held by Sir Orlandus Bridgeman, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal between 1667 and 1672, in the engraving by William Faithorne. One of the ceremonial uses of the burse was to be carried in procession at shoulder height by the Lord High Chancellor preceding the monarch. The burse of Francis North, Baron Guildford (1637–1685), appointed Lord Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal in 1682, survives today in the Burrell Collection.Given its symbolic purpose, the burse was made from the finest and most precious of materials by royal embroiderers and therefore represents the pinnacle of professional embroidery of the period. As such, it displays a veritable catalogue of different uses of metal thread, couching techniques, and appliqué. These techniques are also to be found on heralds’ tabards, robes of state, and other greater and lesser articles of ceremony, and were used in varying levels of detail, relief, and material according to a judicious hierarchy of workmanship that was attached to works made for court ceremonial. The embroidery is almost sculptural in character. The applied raised work in high relief is well dispersed throughout the composition of the square bag, comprising the main decorative elements: the Royal Hanoverian coat of arms at the center, the lion and unicorn rampant on plinths, an orb at the bottom center, and winged putti’s heads punctuating the corners and middle of the sides of the border. All of these elements are composed of couched metal threads of varying width, tone, and form to create a variety of contrasting textures. The colors are concentrated around a palette of gold, silver, and crimson, traditionally associated with English royalty since the time of William the Conqueror (whose arms are included on the first half of the upper left quartering of the coat of arms on the burse, the ""three lions passant gardant or""). The texture achieved by virtue of tightly coiled silver purl in the unicorn’s muzzle or the sinuous undulating ribcage of the lion’s chest demonstrates the skill in manipulating metal threads to give the impression of the natural fall of groomed fur.The arms themselves are those of King George I. To the existing royal arms of the quartered fleurs-de-lis of France, rampant red lion of Scotland, lions passant of England, and harp of Ireland, the Hanoverian arms have been included in the lower left quadrant: two lions passant for Brunswick, harts and a blue lion rampant for Lüneburg, and a white or silver horse for Westphalia. Over this is a diminutive escutcheon with the crown of Charlemagne, an emblem associated with George I’s title as Arch-Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire. In the course of his reign, George I appointed three Lord High Chancellors, and so there are three possible possessors of this burse: William Cowper, 1st Baron Talbot of Hensol (1714–18), Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke (1718–25), and Peter King, 1st Baron King (1725–33). The extravagant three-dimensionality of the burse shows the continued flourishing of professional embroidery at court into the eighteenth century.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Later, the precious bedcover was cut up, and portions were pieced together with a delicate quilted European floral silk to create the panel as it appears today.¹ Its relatively small size indicates that it may have served as a christening or bearing cloth for a child being carried to the baptismal font for christening.²  At the very center of the textile are three bands from the original coverlet, one with a roundel containing a scene of a man and a woman flanking a tree, perhaps inspired by traditional depictions of Adam and Eve. The blossoming tree grows from a large container decorated with a continuous pattern of hexagons, a Chinese design suggesting longevity, and on the tree is a bleeding heart pierced with arrows, a secular symbol referring to love and devotion in Renaissance Europe.³ The dress of the couple is generally consistent with that of late sixteenth to early seventeenth century Europe: the woman’s unstructured clothing is typical of the early seventeenth century, while the man’s hat conforms to late sixteenth-century examples.⁴ Their garments are overembroidered with repeating Chinese patterns, as if made to resemble Chinese silk damasks. The two other adjoining bands at the center of the panel were formerly one. If placed one directly above the other, they form a scene with a pair of ducks in a lotus pond. Although the lotus pond is an enduring theme in Chinese textiles, here the pattern shows a heightened emphasis on flower centers, common in Chinese export textiles, and another type of duck has been substituted for the pair of egrets or mandarin ducks more frequently found in a traditional Chinese image. Another part of the original coverlet was retained as the embroidered border of the present panel; while its sides were heavily pieced together, the ninety-degree corners were untouched in the piecing process, indicating that it served as a border in the original coverlet as well. The delicate, light peach-colored European textile chosen to surround the exotic portions of the cloth has a floral pattern typical of the last decades of the seventeenth century.⁵ The panel is fully lined in a white monochrome woven silk with a small floral pattern on a continuous fretwork background likely woven in China. Cloth of this type, termed rinzu, was exported from China to Japan in large quantities during the seventeenth century to be used as the foundation fabric of luxurious dyed and embroidered Japanese kimonos, until the Japanese started producing it themselves in the mid-Edo period, starting in the 1680s.⁶[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1.

The arms are surmounted by the royal crown and supported by a lion and unicorn engaging the shield with the Order of the Garter with its motto: ""Honi Soit Qvi Mal Y Pense"" in silver filé. The royal arms are surrounded by a voluted cartouche accentuated by fronds of tightly packed silver purl, couched down closely onto the green satin ground and headed by a scroll with the inscription ""Gloria Deo."" Flanking this central cartouche are two unidentified badges bearing a crossed silver key and what appears to be a staff, each within a wreath of satin-stitch laurel leaves and silver bells. Beneath and above these is a finely worked voluted interlace of couched silver cording, from which all the foliage, flowers, and heavily fruit-laden festoons hang in thick profusion.The front cover’s degraded condition helps to identify the array of techniques. A surviving coil of couched silver purls on the lower right volute beneath the royal arms suggests that the entire interlace was once filled with such couched silver purls. This is confirmed by the remnants of stitch holes that once held them to the satin surface. In addition, some missing leaves on the festoon reveal how several detached buttonhole leaves were raised by small tufts of wool felt, still present in the spaces of the festoon’s missing leaves. The various fruits are made vivid by a mixture of pink, blue, red, and yellow silk threads blended expertly in long-and-short-stitch silk thread over padding that follows closely the shape of the gourds, apples or peaches, and pomegranates. The grapes are rendered in a variety of stitches, including couched silver purl in the form of grape clusters loosely stitched over with yellow and pink silk floss. The effect is a silvery pink-yellow variegation that mimics the frosty skin of actual grapes. Ink marks of the original design are still visible in places.The royal coat of arms had been associated with the English Bible since the break with Rome in 1534, when Henry VIII proclaimed himself the ""Supreme Head on Earth"" of the Church of England. Thereafter, the royal coat of arms became emblematic not just of the king’s temporal authority, but his spiritual authority as well. The Tudor, and later the Stuart arms, would be emblazoned over the printed Bible and other investitures of ceremony of the English church, examples of which can be found in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The cover encloses three books bound together: the Geneva version of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer, printed in 1612 and 1616, respectively, by the London printer Robert Barker, as well as a Book of Psalms, printed by the Company of Stationers in London in 1624, a date that provides a terminus post quem for the binding. As David McKitterick notes, it was not uncommon for such works to be bound together in the seventeenth century, even texts of varied dates such as these. The richness of the cover suggests a ceremonial use. The prominent imprese on the cover, possibly relating to insignias of office, may also imply a more official usage. Yvonne Hackenbroch reported a ""tradition"" (though without supporting documentation) that this volume had been a gift from King James I to Sir Edward Denny, later 1st Earl of Norwich. Although in 1870 Isaac d’Israeli recorded an 18th-century report of a gift of gloves from King James I to Denny, this provenance cannot be confirmed from the imprese, which show no likeness to Edward Denny’s coat of arms and have yet to be identified. It may also be reasonably supposed that James would confer as gifts copies of his own Authorized Version of the Bible, in print since 1611, rather than the older Geneva version, as here. A surviving Master’s Crown of the Broderer’s Company, dated to the second half of the sixteenth century and illustrated in George Wingfield-Digby’s Elizabethan Embroidery (1964), is very similar in design and technique to this Bible cover. As such, the comparison brings the latter into association with an unquestionable piece of professional work of the very highest quality and shows the persistence of style and technique into the seventeenth century.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

It illustrates scenes from the life of the biblical patriarch Abraham, as recounted in the Book of Genesis. The central scene shows Abraham being informed by a host of angels that his wife Sarah will bear him a son, despite her advanced age. Other scenes include Abraham banishing his servant Hagar and her son by Abraham, Ishmael (lower left corner), and Abraham's attempted sacrifice of Sarah's son Isaac, the act he was ordered by God to perform as a test of his faith (upper right corner).Biblical narratives were extremely popular subjects for seventeenth-century pictorial embroideries, and a number of other examples depicting the life of Abraham exist. The imagery of the Museum's example is derived from engravings after Maarten de Vos which first appeared in Gerard de Jode's 1579 illustrated bible Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamenti, published in Antwerp. These engravings were also the inspiration for other biblical embroideries, such as the story of David and Bathsheba, and David and Abigail (see 64.101.1325).","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The body of the garment is a Portuguese white silk of the late seventeenth—early eighteenth century brocaded with polychrome silk and chenille yarns. The bright white satin ground of the center panels at front and back are embroidered with silk and silver threads; the materials of this center panel, including the satin ground fabric, are likely from Asia.¹ Narrow metallic woven bands, or galloons, outline the panels and neckline.²A variety of images—including fanciful fountains, unicorns amid cypress trees, spotted leopards, peacocks with tails in full display, and several figures including Hercules and the haloed Christ Child—have been scattered by the weaver throughout the largely secular brocade of the side panels.³ In contrast, the subject matter of the embroidered center panels is entirely Christian. On the front panel are the embroidered initials IHS, the Latin anagram for Jesus Christ used by the Jesuits, while the back panel bears a superimposed A and M for ""Ave Maria"" (or Hail Mary), the archangel Gabriel’s salutation to the Virgin as reported in Luke 1:28. Above the two letters is a crown, and the entire image is surrounded by lilies. An embroidered inscription, qui pascitu inter lilia, a phrase from the Song of Songs (6:3) that translates as ""He who feedeth among the lilies,"" surrounds a silver Paschal Lamb (representing the Lamb of God). Other Christian symbols in the panels include the Pelican in Her Piety, a flowering rose, and a silver pomegranate. The many references to the Virgin in the imagery suggest that this chasuble was used in a convent or in a Jesuit church dedicated to Marian devotion.⁴This elaborate embroidery, with its variety of silk and metallic threads, shares traits and materials from both Portugal and Asia. The multicolor bands that represent the pelican, for example, are typical of Philippine embroidery (detail), yet the bright yellow dye is weld, a European dyestuff.⁵ The flatness of the needlework and its limited palette, as well as the detailed rendering of the individual feathers at the tips of the birds’ wings, are features that may be more Asian than European. A Peruvian example, based on an Asian model, also depicts bird feathers in this way.⁶  It may be that the embroidery took place in Portugal, with artisans also following the Asian model, using a composite of Asian and Portuguese materials.

The brocade, a five-harness silk on a white satin ground with weft float patterning, includes a number of different colors and types of yarns. Some are unspun silk, others are plied two-color (black and white), and still others are chenille yarns with a pile. The two center panels are a white satin seven-harness ground fabric with warp and weft yarns bearing no twist, which likely was imported from China. The embroidery for the silk is satin stitch, with couching stitches to hold the metallic yarns that outline the designs. The embroidery is sparse, revealing the white background throughout. 2. The tape is composed of weft-faced plain weave with silk warp and silk wrapped with metal-sheet weft. 3. This imagery is related to that in a more narrative panel with a large fountain as its central motif (Metropolitan Museum, acc. no. 35.30). Adele Weibel has identified this type of fabric as either Portuguese or from Extremadura in Spain and believes that a group of related textiles with fountains and chenille threads were produced by the same (unknown) master weaver; see Weibel, Two Thousand Years of Textiles, pp. 151—52, nos. 272 and 276.

The men wear breeches and doublets, whose style and cut generally conform to late sixteenth- and early seventeenth century European dress.¹ Yet these Western garments, depicted with detailed embroidery, bear certain characteristic Chinese motifs: one man has a dragon design on his doublet, while another’s costume shows a typically Asian auspicious motif of intersecting diamonds within a diagonal lattice. In addition, the men’s features—including wispy mustaches and beards—have an Asian character. While the embroiderer may have intended to represent Portuguese gentlemen, there is a certain mixing of imagery and types here that is seen in other decorative arts of the period that depict foreigners, such as the painted Japanese Namban screens showing the ""barbarians"" arriving in Japan.²The basic design of the coverlet, which at some point was lined in a vibrant clamp resist-dyed silk from India (MMA 1975.208a-c), consists of a central roundel in a field surrounded by one or more borders; although this layout is frequently seen in works made for export, it also appears in domestic Chinese kang (daybed) covers.³ Its imagery—including dragons flanking a flaming jewel, the birds and flowers of the border, and the Chinese-style lions in each corner—is common in Chinese textiles. Some of the details, however, are unusual, or are combined in unexpected ways, suggesting the involvement of a European trader or client unfamiliar with the selection and placement of motifs in Chinese iconography. The jewel between the dragons, for example, is uniformly surrounded by flames, resembling a Western sun more than the characteristic Asian flaming jewel. And the lotus pond at one edge of the border, which would normally be the backdrop for pairs of waterfowl, such as ducks or egrets,⁴ instead features large pheasants, more often depicted in a dry, rocky setting.

It was known to be a favorite of the queen herself and the pansy continued to appear in embroidery well into the seventeenth century.Despite the present fragile and somewhat degraded condition of these gloves, they retain enough of their sumptuous embroidery to convey the luxury of the highest quality needlework of the late Tudor and early Stuart era.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This is the most common type of extant seventeenth-century sampler, and its standard format was established by about 1630. The foundation was generally cut from one complete width of plain-weave linen, so that the selvages are present at what becomes the top and bottom of the finished work, and the sides are hemmed. Polychrome band samplers are typical, although some band samplers combined rows of whitework, cutwork, and needle lace with the polychrome patterns (see MMA, 57.122.368). A band sampler such as this would have most likely been a task completed by a schoolgirl under the supervision of an embroidery instructor of some kind. In fact, a band sampler was usually the first piece worked by a budding embroiderer beginning at about age seven or eight. The complete embroidered works by Martha Edlin, the only extant group of a young girl’s educational work, now housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum, begins with a band sampler as her earliest accomplishment.This example, signed by Anna Bucket, introduces the band sampler into the realm of the decorative by adding an image of a courting couple at the top of the sampler. With its precise date and the name of the maker placed prominently, above the cupid who hovers between the couple, the maker may have been referring explicitly to her actual or hoped-for marriage. The couple is accompanied by a dog, symbol of fidelity in marriage, and surrounded by the heraldic unicorn and lion. The image is a miniature version of the numerous pictures of courting couples in which the man and woman stand on variegated green and yellow grass; in addition to the animals, the scene is embellished with fruiting trees, flowers, and insects completely out of scale to their human companions. This type of sampler may have been displayed in the home, as became common practice in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Contemporary evidence of this practice can be found in the criminal proceedings of the Old Bailey: in December of 1750 a man was convicted for stealing, among other things, ""one needle-work sampler, with a frame and glass.""

This type of composition is often associated with the influence of Portuguese and Spanish models, although there are some earlier Asian examples that employ this format as well.² Wholly Asian in subject and style, however, are the motifs. The pair of phoenixes at the center of the textile encircle a large peony. Similar dynamically posed birds are also seen in an architectural stone relief excavated from the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) capital and now in the National Museum of China, Beijing, as well as in a corresponding textile in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum,³ and peonies often figure in Ming rank badges, in which a pair of birds encircle a flower. Within the rectangular field are flowers and four more birds -- two golden pheasants and two peacocks, which were used as insignia for the second and third civil ranks in both Ming and Qing China. The multiple borders surrounding the central field include a wide border embroidered with various animals—rare creatures such as a tiger and elephant in addition to the familiar horse, deer, and goat, all of which are depicted side by side with such distinctively mythical Chinese beasts as a blue qilin and a white, singlehorned xiezhi. A composite animal with hooves and usually a single horn, the qilin is mentioned in poetry as early as the Han dynasty (206 b.c.–a.d. 220),⁴ its appearance was sometimes said to signal the birth of a sage, and it was used as a rank insignia for nobles. The xiezhi also appears in Han dynasty texts; known for its ability to distinguish virtue from evil, it used its sharp teeth and single horn to bite and gore wrongdoers, and it was the insignia for the censorate, which included judges. Here, both animals have flames shooting off their bodies, indicating their supernatural powers. Embroideries of this type were made for export, and a number have been preserved in Japan and Europe in historical contexts. The oldest documented example is an altar cloth in Saikyo￣ ji, a temple in Kyoto; it was donated in 1616.⁵ Another example, now in the Museo Diocesano, Chiavari, Italy, was donated to a church in Chiavari in 1651 and used as a baldachin, or canopy, for the clergy.⁶  Others are preserved in museum collections.⁷Chinese textiles and other goods came to the Americas via the Manila galleons’ annual trips between Acapulco (and Callao, the port city of Lima) and the Philippines. While to date no preserved embroideries from this group have been found in Mexico or Peru, their influence was present there by the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century,⁸ as evident in the similar layout and motifs of a Peruvian tapestry in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 33).⁹[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1.

Although such beadwork baskets clearly did not lend themselves to this kind of practical use, their imagery is also usually celebratory and commemorative of marriage or betrothal. Such is the case with this piece, which celebrates the union in 1662 of King Charles II and Catherine of Braganza. They stand in the center of the satin panel, surrounded by a profusion of fruits and flowers that is generally suggestive of fecundity, although such elements as the butterflies, a radiant sun, and an oak sapling may have been chosen for their specifically Royalist associations. In this context, the peacock at the center beneath the royal couple may be an emblem of the Restoration, as the peacock’s traditionally incorruptible body was associated with rebirth and resurrection. The four female figures who stand around the royal couple are the Four Continents, identifiable by the creatures that accompany them. Europe with a stag stands at top left, Asia with a leopard at top right. The lower register is less clear because of the interchangeability of the figures’ attributes, but nonetheless the griffin probably represents Africa and the cockatrice America (see also MMA, 39.13.2a). The placement of the royal couple at the center of the Four Continents was to situate their union within the wider compass of a divinely appointed natural order.A number of very similar beadwork baskets survive from the third quarter of the seventeenth century and share the same essential structure: a rectangular frame made from heavy gauge wire, spherical feet, and everted sides extending outward from the base, with regular intervals of wire of the same gauge forming square openings. The handles are bent in a trefoil shape and extend from the center of each of the four sides. The wire is wrapped in variegated colored patterns of beads.It has been suggested that the introduction of beadwork into English embroidery was related to a growing trade with the Far East, Africa, and the Americas. Glass beads, or ""bugles,"" were produced on a large scale in Venice and Amsterdam in the seventeenth century and shipped in quantity to ports near London, where they were destined to be traded for fine materials that were imported to Europe. Joan Edwards speculated that the use of these beads in embroidery must have developed suddenly after the 1630s when this trade first began. She posited that haberdashers, merchants, or bead traders, who often also sold wire, realized the market potential of the use of such beads in women’s embroidery. Many raised-work pictures of the period also incorporate glass beads, demonstrating an appetite for the unusual and exuberant.It is probable that baskets of this kind were made by professionals or perhaps sold as kits. Certainly, it is likely that the intricate and lifelike fruits were professionally produced. Even the king and queen are produced on a slip of canvas and were probably prefabricated. This is substantiated by a strikingly similar basket, from the Untermyer collection, now at Colonial Williamsburg, which has the same form of frame and whose applied fruits and flowers with an identically posed king and queen are worked in the same beaded pattern and colors.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

To some extent, the panel can be classified with other commonly occurring images of the royal couple in contemporary embroidery. These appear to have been primarily celebratory or commemorative in nature, but the direct association made here between contemporary royalty and Adam and Eve is unique among surviving embroidered pictures, indeed among the images of royalty in every medium. It therefore has significance within the wider field of royal iconography of the Caroline era.The embroidery can be dated to a time after 1634, because the poses of Charles I and Henrietta Maria are derived from an engraving by Robert van Voerst first published in that year. The print shows Charles and Henrietta Maria exchanging olive and laurel branches, emblems of peace and military glory, and it celebrates their marriage and the political advantages that accrued from it. The print is a copy of the painting by Anthony van Dyck of 1632, which itself is a reworking of an original by Daniel Mytens of ca. 1630–32.This association between royal marriage and royal authority is carried over into the embroidery, although apart from the poses of the royal couple, it retains little of the symbolism of its prototype. In place of the exchange of olive and laurel branches between the royal couple, Henrietta Maria offers her husband a flower, while Charles holds a sword and scepter, the symbols of worldly dominion. The association of the royal marriage and Charles’s symbols of monarchy with Adam and Eve, the first married couple, carries the suggestion that Charles’s claim to royal authority rests on a chain of royal—specifically familial—descent stretching back to the Fall and even before that, to humankind’s state of innocence. Such a juxtaposition would have resonated in the 1630s and 1640s with the political debates that raged over the nature of political authority. In these debates, the varied justifications for political organization, whether Royalist, Parliamentarian, or Leveller, were invariably based on some understanding of Adamic patriarchy and the first marriage. For all political complexions, the concept of Paradise that had once existed in some place and time provided the key to the way in which ideal social relations once were and should still be.The theme of the panel appears to be an explicit reflection of the Royalist argument, which saw Adamic patriarchy as the basis of the divine right of kings. In The Glasse of Time (1620), Thomas Peyton described James I as ""A royall King deriued from the race, / O f Edens Monarch in her greatest grace, / Within whose face true Maiesty doth shine."" According to Richard Cumberland, a friend of Samuel Pepys, ""Humankind, and by consequence, all Societies and Families sprang from the matrimonial Union of one Man with one Woman. And, consequently, all Civil Government is originally laid out in a natural Parental Authority"" (De Legibus Naturae, 1672). Such arguments and their counter-arguments, which maintained that the right to govern derived from the consent of the people, were furiously debated during the crisis of Parliament and the Civil War years of the 1640s. John Maxwell, chaplain to Charles I, argued in Sacro-Sancta Regum Majestas (1644) that monarchy was fixed by God in the time before the Fall. ""Can we be so stupid as to acknowledge the dominion over all creatures below is given to man immediately by God, and to deny that the most noble and excellent Government by which man hath Power and Empire over men is not from God . . . but by Compact and Contract, the Composition and Constitution of men?"" Sir Robert Filmer, in his Patriarcha: or, The Natural Right of Kings (probably written about 1630, but not published until 1680), justified monarchy on hereditary grounds—that Adam and the patriarchs after him had royal authority over their children by right of fatherhood, and that this authority had been given to them by God. ""The first Father had not only simply power, but power monarchical, as he was a Father immediately from God. For by the appointment of God, as soon as Adam was created he was monarch of the world, though he had no subjects."" For Filmer, Adam’s was ""[a]s large and ample as the Absolutest Dominion of any Monarch which hath been since the Creation.""Such views reached the popular domain via sermons and pamphlets. John Evelyn recorded in a diary entry of May 1678 having heard a sermon that argued for the monarchical over all other systems of government, ""& that from Adam (to whom God had given the Empire of all things & Persons) that it seemed to be not onely of divine, but most natural institution."" And on January 30, 1694, the anniversary of the death of Charles I, Evelyn heard a young man preach on the ""Excellency of Kingly Government above all other, deriving it from Adam, The Patriarchs, God himselfe."" The panel therefore shows an embroiderer directly engaged in these debates, asserting sympathy for the Royalist cause. As such, it shows the expressive freedom of the embroidery medium, which because of its relatively private nature allowed its makers to react personally to events and to create images encompassing themes that lay outside and beyond the iconographical norms of public art, both popular prints and the more exclusive iconography of the court.[Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The front cover shows King David in profile playing his lyre, illuminated by divine rays emanating from above. Yvonne Hackenbroch noted that this standing King David derived from a figure of David on the title page of a Bible published in Cambridge in 1629. Hackenbroch also found the source for the pose of the King David on the back cover, where he is posed facing outward and holding a scepter and lyre: the title page of the third volume of Gerard de Jode’s Thesaurus Novi Testamenti (Antwerp, 1585). The spine of this Bible has five registers, each with a tent-stitch flower typical of this period. The flowers from top to bottom are: tulip, cornflower, rose, pansy, and carnation/pink. The needle-worked binding contains three liturgical texts: the New Testament (in Greek), the Book of Common Prayer, and the Book of Psalms (with musical accompaniment).The image of King David, the supposed author of the Psalms, shown here illuminated by divine rays, was an appropriate and conventional image often used to adorn books of Psalms and other liturgical works; numerous examples survive, both professional and amateur. The British Library has several, including one nearly identical in style to the Metropolitan Museum’s copy. It, too, has been made with the sumptuous materials and high-quality craftsmanship of the professional embroiderer. It has the same raised cartouches with masks on both front and back covers but with different images from the life of David within each surround.The Museum’s Bible is said to have belonged to William Laud (1573–1645), who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633 and was one of Charles I’s chief ministers. This determination is based on an old (though not contemporary) inscription written in ink on the blue silk on the inside front cover: ""This book formerly belonged to Archbishop Laud."" If this is the case, then the book and its richly worked cover assume a powerful symbolic status. Laud was a pivotal and highly divisive figure in early seventeenth-century English religious and political life, primarily because of his attempts to reform the liturgy and to impose on the English church a richly ceremonial form of worship. This stemmed from a particular view of the divine presence within the physical structure of the church itself. The church was, as the Laudian Robert Skinner proclaimed in 1634 in a sermon before the king, the place where ""our Lord God most holy doth inhabit."" It was ""his proper mansion or dwelling place."" Such a notion of divine presence thus infused all objects used in worship with a spiritual aura. For the Laudian Alexander Read in 1636, all such objects were to be held as ""holy in relation to the holy use whereto it is assigned."" Even the cloth bags used to carry the communion bread into the church were special, ""since the very bringing of it into the church to that use is a taking out of the world, a promotion of it to more reverence and a next step to consecration itself."" This attitude promoted the value of beauty in ecclesiastical ornament and decoration. As the anonymous R.T. wrote in 1638, a church should properly contain ""all kinds of ornaments that might add glory and grace . . . as curious paintings, hangings, gilding, sumptuous vestments, rich gifts of money, chalices, plate."" Within its original context, therefore, the Metropolitan Museum’s richly adorned Bible would have seemed, as Lake put it, to ""glow with the beauty of holiness."" The sense of beauty in reverence extended also to ceremonial and ritual aspects of the liturgy, the rubrics for which were contained within the Book of Common Prayer. Strict adherence to the order of the liturgy was regarded as the surest means of true communion with God and indeed constituted for Laud the only legitimate form of prayer. Whether or not the Metropolitan Bible actually belonged to Laud, it nonetheless embodies the Laudian style, both in the text itself—the Book of Common Prayer, which, containing the whole liturgy, stood at the center of Laudian worship—and in the extravagant richness of its decoration, which infuses it with ""the beauty of holiness.""A sincere Protestant, Laud wished to reinstate such practices and objects into the Church of England, which he regarded as historically and theologically accurate and which predated the corruption of the Church of Rome. As the highest prelate in the land, he sought to impose practices such as bowing to the altar (which replaced the communal ""Lord’s table""), the use of incense in the performance of liturgical prayers, and the use of rich vestments in the exercise of the liturgy. Such actions, as well as his resistance to the Puritan emphasis on bibliocentric piety and preaching, alienated both hardline and moderate Puritans. The introduction of what were widely considered Catholic or popish customs provoked significant opposition. The rebellion in Scotland in July 1637—a reaction to the institution of a new form of liturgy modeled on the English Book of Common Prayer—was what forced Charles I to recall Parliament, which in turn set off a series of events leading to the Civil Wars and Laud’s own eventual execution at the hands of Parliament in 1645.[Katy Reed-Basham and Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The widespread popularity of the story is apparent from the number of its depictions that have survived.The scenes shown extol the ideal pleasures of Arcadian life. Macée washes her feet in a stream and later raids a bird's nest with Gombaut in a scene taken from the first tapestry. Then they play tiquet, a game similar to croquet, and a man smacks a girl.

The 1601 inventory of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury (1527-1608), included two quilts that were almost certainly products of this trade: “a quilt of yellow India stuff embroidered with birds and beasts” and “a quilt of India stuff embroidered with beastes.""¹ Indian quilts of the type produced for the Portuguese market appeared with increasing frequency in London sales into the 1620s, when their value began to decline, perhaps because of diminishing novelty.²The taste for Indian-style embroidery remained, however, and it is interesting to note that the English maker of this textile used not only the Indian palette of golden yellow on white but also an imported Indian cotton as the foundation. The cover has rare seventeenth-century marks on the plain-weave cotton fabric: the initials G.C.E. (for the English East India Company's original name, The Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies) as well as three other stamps whose significance has not yet been deciphered.³ On this bedcover, the embroidered designs draw heavily on such exotic motifs as pineapple-like vegetation and serrated leaves, but contemporary European sensibilities are also evident in the strapwork connecting the floral elements. Additionally, the three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the use of stitches with long floats that create a shinier surface to contrast with the matte appearance of the cotton ground diverge from the Indian prototypes, whose flatter chain stitches are less glossy. English bedcovers were usually part of coordinated sets that could include bolsters, pillows, and matching valances⁴In addition to the more common monochrome yellow-on white embroideries, Indian polychrome embroideries also arrived in England during the early seventeenth century. They, too, are described in sale records; for example, a 1614 sale included “a carpet or quilt embroidered upon calico with sundry silks.""⁵  The word “carpet” is probably used in its contemporaneous sense, that is, to signify decorative covers for a variety of furniture types, including beds. MMA 1970.173, an English polychrome silk and metal-thread bedcover, is more obviously dependent on the stylistic composition of Persian and Turkish carpets than this textile. By the eighteenth century, both embroidered and painted cotton textiles of this type, with a central medallion and smaller medallions in the corners of the central field, were being made in India for domestic consumption and for export.⁶  These imported polychrome covers had a lasting influence on the production of English embroidered bed furnishings of the eighteenth century.

The château, situated on a hillside overlooking the Seine not far from Paris, became the queen's favorite summer residence. Built in the sixteenth century and rebuilt during the seventeenth, the palace was in need of renovation. The architect Richard Mique (1728–1794) enlarged and altered it, and appropriate furnishings were ordered for the queen's apartment.Many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené (1748–1803), a member of an important dynasty of Parisian chair makers who received a royal appointment in 1784. Sené provided a set of seat furniture for the queen's dressing room, called her cabinet particulier ox cabinet de toilette that is described in the 1789 inventory of Saint Cloud.

The front stiles of the head- and footboard, which are of equal height, are carved with female half-figures wearing Egyptian headdresses. The bergère, which has a medallion with Marie Antoinette's initials on its top rail, is decorated in a similar manner. A decade before Napoleon's North African campaign was to inspire the fashion known as égyptomanie, the queen appears to have had a taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art. Seated classical female figures, rather than Egyptian caryatids, decorate the feet of the fire screen, and a woman who once held a cornucopia reclines on its top. The carver is not known, but Louis-François Chatard (ca. 1749–1819) was responsible for painting and gilding the frames.According to the 1789 inventory the set was originally upholstered in a white-twilled cotton with rows of individual flowers embroidered by the queen herself. When the three pieces came to the Museum in 1941 only the fire screen's show cover had survived. Although the cotton ground is much discolored, Marie Antoinette's interlaced initials, composed of blossoms embroidered in satin stitch, are in remarkably good condition.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to enter this market, but most surviving Gujarati embroideries relate to trade with England, which increased in the early seventeenth century.¹ Over the course of the seventeenth century, as the Gujarati embroiderers adjusted their output for the English market, they adopted the common motif of pink flowers detailed in yellow that bloom from dark green vines with light green or yellow veins. In the background are spotted leopards, striped deer, squirrels, birds, and other chain-stitched beasts filled with bands of color or details in contrasting hues. These elements are understood to have been culled from a variety of sources including English embroideries, examples of which must have been sent to India as models (see e.g. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, nos. 53.2202 and 53.172). But as English embroidery was itself responding to the influx of Asian textiles, incorporating and adapting many foreign motifs, the result was a mix of European, Indian, and Chinese imagery that then fed back to its original sources in a totally transformed state. This piece, consisting of several panels that have been joined and then quilted to form a bed-size coverlet, includes the motifs found on seventeenth-century coverlets but must have been made in the early eighteenth century, when an overall pattern of rinceaux enclosing flowers became more common.² However, Gujarati production is remarkable for its variety; at the same time, embroiderers were also producing patterns related to French bizarre silks and palampore designs (see e.g. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, no. 57.168).

It is divided into two parts—""matters Civil"" and ""matters Sacred""—and includes additional material gathered from his supporters about events surrounding his death. It constitutes an expanded edition of an earlier compilation, the Eikon Basilike [Image of the King]: The Poutraicture of His Sacred Maiestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings, a 1649 printing of which is bound into the second part of the volume. The Eikon Basilike purported to be a collection of the writings of Charles I that presented the major events of his life and reign from his own point of view in language that was simple, direct, and, for a monarch, unprecedentedly personal. This narrative was interspersed with the king’s favorite prayers and psalms in a style that directly echoed the Penitential Psalms of King David and thereby offered both a justification of his rule and a kind of spiritual autobiography.The Eikon Basilike was first published by Richard Royston, who was the leading Royalist publisher in London throughout the Civil War period and who was imprisoned in 1645 for issuing ""scandalous books and papers"" against the Parliament and thereafter in constant danger of further harassment at the hands of the Council of State. By his own account, Royston received orders directly from the king in October 1648 to prepare his printing press; on December 23 he was given the manuscript through an Edward Simmons, as from the king, and had it printed. Charles’s authorship has been contested from its first appearance to the present day, although it is now widely agreed (as the Royalist apologists had insisted) that the core of the book was Charles’s but that the materials were shaped into their final form by his chaplain, the Presbyterian divine John Gauden, later bishop of Exeter.From the beginning, the Eikon Basilike was a hugely popular best-seller and became the chief focus of national grief and guilt after the king’s death. The book was sold on the streets of London on January 30, 1649, the day of Charles’s execution, and went through thirty-five English editions that year. It became, in effect, a form of common property, hotly debated among Parliamentarian detractors and their Royalist opponents and prompting numerous rebuttals and counter-rebuttals, including John Milton’s furious rejoinder, Eikonoklastes, which appeared on October 6, 1649. As Elizabeth Wheeler emphasized, the Eikon Basilike had no single fixed appearance and from the first was subject to numerous additions of text and images. The work also appeared in a range of cheap to expensive editions and in different formats, from regular folio size to tiny miniature versions.The present copy of Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae is one product of this process, although Frances Madan noted that all the additional materials within were vouched for by persons who were near the king and involved in the publication process of the original Eikon Basilike. It includes a miscellany of the king’s speeches to Parliament, his ""Messages for Peace,"" and, in the second part, a selection of his prayers, the text of the Eikon Basilike, his ""papers about Church Government,"" a list of the judges who officiated at Charles’s trial in a section headed ""Severall things relating to His Majesties Death, a list of London’s mayor and city aldermen, and various speeches and epitaphs by others made after the king’s death. According to Madan, this edition was published in London by Roger Norton with the false Hague imprint of Samuel Browne, suggesting that there was an inherent danger for Royston and his London printer, Roger Norton, in publishing such materials during these years.The embroidered cover of this volume has on the front the figure of a woman holding a cornucopia, probably representing Plenty; on the back is a woman holding a palm branch, presumably Peace. Plenty and Peace were likely qualities that the owner attached to monarchical rule. Embroidered references or borrowings from the Eikon Basilike include in the Victoria and Albert Museum collection an embroidered panel after the William Marshall engraving used as the frontispiece for the 1649 version of the Eikon Basilike (inv. no. T.117-1936). The frontispiece of this volume is an engraved portrait of Charles I by Wenceslaus Hollar (MMA, 17.50.85) that is derived from the double portrait of Charles and Henrietta Maria by Anthony van Dyck.[Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

As today, they had practical functions: they were used for protection or warmth, and, in some cases, perfumed gloves were used for medical purposes. Yet they were also potent extensions of social actions; they were symbols of status and obligation, thrown down in challenge or treasured as tokens of affection. In this way, gloves were a conspicuous pleasure—in paintings, they are frequently held rather than worn. This pair features preening birds of paradise, carnations, roses, and tiny borages—possibly inspired by those in La Clef des Champs (1586) and A schole-house, for the needle (1632)—and set within arabesques. The tabbed, gauntlet-style was popular for displaying elaborate, expensive professional embroidery, as the tabs are slightly gusseted to fit over the wearer’s intricate lace cuffs.

Part of a major decorative commission executed by Jean Démosthène Dugourc, they were intended to decorate the Billiard Room of the Casita del Labrador in Aranjuez, the rural pleasure palace built for King Charles IV of Spain between 1791 and 1803. The panels were woven by Camille Pernon, premier producer of luxury silks in Lyon. The central embroidered landscapes, based on paintings of the countryside surrounding Arunjuez, were probably applied after the panels were delivered to Spain.Dugourc, who was raised at Versailles, was named dessinateur du Garde-Meuble de la Couronne in 1784. From 1786 he also worked for the decoration of a number of rooms at the Casita del Labrador. These panels are a strong statement of his eclectic use of motifs, in this case taken from Raphael's decorations for the Vatican Loggia, which were in turn inspired by Roman wall paintings.

Wool could easily be dyed with the natural dyes of the period in a wide array of vivid colors. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, one of the most popular forms was variations on the Tree of Life motif, inspired by the colorful painted cotton palampores of the same design that were imported into Britain. This pair of bed curtain panels is exceptional for its unusual design, which is more closely related to woven silk textiles of the period. On this grand scale, the leaves also hark back to late medieval decorative cabbage-leaf verdure tapestries. The blue and white palette of the embroidery certainly reflects the immense popularity of the Chinese export and Dutch Delft ceramics that were avidly collected in Britain.These curtain panels would have formed part of a set of hangings, which would have also upper and lower valances, a head cloth, a bed cover or counterpane and wider curtains that would enclose the entire bed when drawn. As the hanging curtains often saw the least amount of physical wear, these are often the elements that survive from a matched set.

Based on the small number of documented seventeenth-century embroiderers who made multiple samplers, it is thought that samplers containing whitework, cutwork, drawnwork, and lace designs were stitched only after multi-colored band samplers were finished, as whitework techniques are more difficult. While many surviving English samplers include lace, cutwork, and drawnwork, few examples of seventeenth-century lace have been attributed to English manufacture.This sampler is worked in whitework and reticella, which requires a stitcher to remove warp and weft threads from a piece of fabric before stabilizing the fabric with buttonhole stitches and creating designs based on the grid of the linen. The top of the sampler, worked in satin, eye, and line stitches, features the initials ""MD"" (presumably the initials of the maker) and an alphabet, along with geometric and stylized floral patterns of varying length.

By the 1580s portraits of Queen Elizabeth I and several of her courtiers show the sitters wearing embroidered sleeves decorated with an early version of this pattern in monochrome thread (usually black) on white linen.¹  Examples like this coif, made of linen embroidered with polychrome silk and metal threads, were first produced about 1600. This popular scrolling pattern appeared on both men’s and women’s headgear, women’s jackets, and furnishing textiles. The design, which may derive from similar motifs found in Islamic Spain, remained fashionable in England at least until the 1620s.² Features like the small diaper patterns used to fill the interiors of individual leaves and flower petals in blackwork embroidery and the striped or shaded leaves and petals like those seen here continued to be employed in English crewel embroidery of the later seventeenth century. These features are also found in some of the earlier surviving Indian chintz patterns produced for export to Europe. English embroidery patterns and Continental verdure tapestries were sources that contributed to the creation of the lush floral designs seen in late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Indian chintz.³ A miniature version of a scrolling floral pattern appears in one of the earliest surviving Indian chintzes, found on the walls of the circa 1677 dollhouse of Petronella Dunois (1650–1695), now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (no. BK-14656)⁴  A sarasa for the Japanese market (see MMA 2010.55), another type of Indian cotton, also displays this type of pattern, and a much larger-scale variation that includes exotic animals appears on an Indian embroidered bedcover (see MMA 68.61).A number of ornament prints, such as the German artist Bernhard Zan’s design of 1581 (see MMA 20.8.1), could have served as models for European embroideries. Like the rinceaux design itself, ornament prints often had extended periods of use and were circulated and copied long after their original invention. While there is to date no concrete evidence that designs or textiles of this exact type were sent to Indian craftsmen to copy, the practice of sending patterns to India is well documented, and it seems likely that versions of such successful patterns as the European rinceaux with flowers influenced Indian textile production for the international market.

Those who could not afford a cabinet mounted with imported Asian lacquer panels or a suite of tapestries like those produced by John Vanderbank (see MMA 53.165.2) could still satisfy their taste by wearing a petticoat or other fashionable accessory decorated with exotic motifs. In 1688 John Stalker and George Parker published A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing, which includes twenty-four copperplate designs that could be used to decorate a variety of objects (see MMA 32.80.2). This book also gives detailed instructions on how to create imitation lacquer, or japanning, on various household objects. The text shows a lack of specificity regarding culture and geography that was typical of the period. For example, in their preface, the authors sing the praises of Japan and its architecture, but in the instructions the reader is advised ""that if you would exactly imitate and copie [sic] out the Japan [design for imitation lacquer]"" one should look to ""the true Indian work"" where they ""never crowd up their ground with many Figures, Houses, or Trees, but allow great space to little work.""¹There are extant English mirrors that retain their original ""Japanned"" frames, as well as American furniture decorated with motifs from works like A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing.² However, such books inspired more than just imitation lacquer on furniture. This embroidered panel and its mate are among a number of English examples from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that are stitched with similar exotic designs. A small quilt in the Metropolitan Museum and two panels in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, are all embroidered with the motifs of the woman carrying a fan with an attendant who shades her with a parasol, and tiny pavilions dwarfed by oversize foliage.³  One of the panels in Boston bears the rare signature of a professional pattern draftsman, one John Stilwell who had a shop near Covent Garden, London.

Its slender, A-line shape was common in chasubles of eighteenth-century Spain, where it may have been used.¹ The focal point of the embroidered design is the roundel with a double-headed eagle at the center of the vestment’s front and back. Although the double-headed eagle surmounted by a crown was a symbol of the Habsburg monarchy, here it is purely decorative and tinged with an auspicious Chinese flavor.² Instead of grasping arrows in their talons, as they would in the Habsburg motif, the birds dangle flowering and leafy stems from their beaks. In Chinese textiles auspicious birds frequently hold symbolic flora: a rank badge in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection features a crane that grips a branch bearing both a peach and a peach blossom.³ The front and back of the chasuble are each divided into three vertical sections, separated by narrow embroidered floral trim that also borders the neck and edges.⁴ The central section consists of a series of vertically aligned roundels, floral rosettes, and geometrically decorated vessels resting on stands amid a simple ogival pattern of flowering vines. On each of the two side sections, a graceful design of delicately curving leafy stems emerges from a multicolored cornucopia, a long-standing European motif. Cornucopias are included in at least two other eighteenth-century chasubles embroidered in China, one now in the Metropolitan and the other in the Museo Nacional del Virreinato, Tepotzotlan, Mexico, and formerly in the Catedral de Mexico—a reminder that there were markets besides Europe for chasubles embroidered in China.⁵ The scrolling pattern of the side panels is punctuated with large flowers, some of which include elements from Chinese decorative arts and others that are unusual from a Chinese perspective—even quite fantastic. The large flowers close to the cornucopias on the front of the garment and flanking the eagle roundel on the back are rather unrefined in technique, featuring dots on their radiating petals and a bold red, white, yellow, and blue coloration that lacks the more subtle shades of light red seen in the smaller flowers nearby, a customary coloration in Chinese embroidery. As dotted petals are fairly common in Indian floral textiles of the eighteenth century but unusual in Chinese examples, these bold flowers and other similarly distinctive blooms may reflect the Chinese embroiderer’s attempt to mimic the Indian floral patterns that were so popular in international trade.

In addition to this miniature, other examples include: two in the Victoria and Albert Museum, one in the Wallace Collection in London, one in Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, and one in the collection of John H. Bryan, which is housed in a silver-gilt frame engraved with the royal armorial and date of Charles’s execution, 30 January 1648 (old calendar). Like a painting in silk thread, this miniature represents the merging of two English artistic traditions—a naturalistic rendering of faces using fine techniques such as split stitch, which had been in use in England since the twelfth century, and the painted miniature portrait, a courtly fashion that began during the reign of Henry VIII.The king’s likeness has been taken with great fidelity from a 1641 etching by Wenceslaus Hollar, which was itself ultimately derived from a chain of different prints based on a painted portrait by Anthony van Dyck of Charles I and his consort, Henrietta Maria, painted in 1632. Oliver Millar has noted that van Dyck’s painting is in itself a reworking of the original composition by Daniel Mytens of ca. 1630-32, in the Royal Collection, Hampton Court Palace.The embroidery is contained within a glazed silver frame with molded edges and a suspension loop at the top, flanked on either side by a spiral ribbon cresting. The glass has beveled edges, and its various imperfections and minute air bubbles suggest that it is original to the period. An example of what Daphne Foskett calls a ""cabinet miniature,"" it was intended to be mounted in a cabinet or placed on a table.The bust of Charles is slightly raised from the flat gray-green satin background, an effect produced by the portrait’s having been stitched on satin. The king’s characteristic hairstyle, pointed beard, and upturned moustache are convincingly shaded in various tones of brown, brown-red, and light blond threads. Strands of hair are worked directly on the satin, with the raised portion skillfully merged into the background. The cheeks and jawline are also enhanced by shadowy tones that suggest both stubble and facial bone structure. Each thread is worked in a virtuoso technique that varies the stitch length, tension, and twist in such a way as to manipulate the play of light over the silk fibers. The intensity of detail can be grasped in a number of passages, such as Charles’s right eye, which is created from an amalgam of minute stitches. One can see under magnification that the lower lid is outlined by a minute pink thread, couched down, and worked over by a mass of flesh-toned silk. The iris is laid down in several shades of blue thread, separated from the black pupil by a lighter couching thread, which not only suggests depth by pulling the other threads around the pupil, but also creates the catch-light that defines Charles’s expression.The extraordinarily developed detail of this and the other, similar miniature portraits of the king led at one time to their being dated to the later eighteenth century, when interest in the cult of the martyred king was still strong. J.L. Nevinson, however, demonstrated the use of such techniques in other works that can be firmly placed in the period between 1650 and the end of the seventeenth century, including an embroidered bookbinding with a detailed portrait of a youth now in the Houghton Library at Harvard University that contains a copy of Hopkins’s Psalms dated 1648. It is likely then that the miniature was produced in the second half of the seventeenth century, either before or, as Nevinson posited, in the years immediately following the Restoration and is thus part of the imagery associated with the cult of the Royal Martyr.The link with the cult of Charles the Martyr is made explicit by the embroidered inscription, a quotation from Psalm 18, which associates Charles directly with the Old Testament patriarch King David: ""Deus meus est Rvpis mea Psa: 18."" The reference is to Psalm 18:2–3, which invokes God’s protection against his enemies: ""The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies."" Although the connection between contemporary monarchs and King David was a commonplace one, the specific association made here, of Charles I with the Psalms of King David, assumed a central importance in his posthumous cult. It drew from that most popular of all commemorative works, the literary ""self-portrait"" of the martyred king, the Eikon Basilike, a book notionally containing Charles Stuart’s own apologia for his life and reign, which, with its inclusion of the king’s favorite prayers and psalms, offered a kind of spiritual autobiography. Both the prayers and the meditations of the Eikon Basilike explicitly echo the Psalms of David. Indeed, the embroidered image is taken directly from a print that serves as the frontispiece of the Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae of 1651, an expanded edition of the king’s works with a bound-in 1649 version of the Eikon Basilike. As Elizabeth Wheeler has shown, the ""repeated evocation of the Psalms, the emphasis on conscience, the insistence on the depth and sorrow of his sufferings"" found in this work all presented a figure intimately accessible to ordinary laymen and women.This intimacy was reflected in small-scale portraits like the present example and other small commemorative objects that were made in the years immediately after the king’s execution. They reflect, too, the peculiarly private aspect of mourning for the king that characterized the ten-year period before the Restoration, during which time there were few permitted outlets for public grief. As Lois Potter has suggested, this circumstance conditioned the nature of the ensuing cult of the martyred king and in particular stimulated the production of such small, intimate kinds of memorial art. The inclusion of the scriptural inscription explicitly offered up the image of the martyred king as a spiritual model. The tradition that the monarch’s own hair was worked into the image would have further emphasized the character of a relic. A number of such objects are recorded in the former collection of Percival D. Griffiths. A poem by Jeremiah Wells (1646–1679), written in reaction to an analogous small-scale portrait of Charles drawn in ink on parchment, which he saw in the library of St. John’s College, Oxford, in 1665, vividly conveys the ecstatic emotions such portraits could summon up. In the latter portrait, the identification of Charles with King David is made literally indelible, for the lines of the face and hair are rendered in minute script that supposedly contain the whole Book of Psalms, or at least the Penitential Psalms. In a manuscript draft of the poem (later amended), Wells begins: ""Wash thy impure feet, and trembling trace / With wary steps this more than sacred place."" The first stanza of the published version continues in similarly hyperbolic fashion, mystically equating the king’s body with the divine word:""With double reverence we approach to lookOn what’s at once a picture and a book:Nor think it Superstition to adoreA king made now more sacred then before . . .The object here’s Majestick and divine,Divinity does Majesty enshrine . . .""A portrait of the playwright Thomas Killigrew, painted by William Shephard one year after the king’s execution, when Killigrew was in Venice as the political agent of the exiled Charles II, provides visual evidence, similarly rhetorical, as to how such images of the king were used. Killigrew sits at his desk with a (somewhat larger) portrait of Charles I on the wall behind him. He adopts a classic attitude of melancholy, which in other circumstances might have signified merely his own creative temperament, but which in this context may be taken to connote a stoical, philosophical grief for the executed king. His loyalty to the Stuart cause is further underlined by the copy of the Eikon Basilike that lies beneath the pile of his own plays. It is easy to imagine the embroidered portrait miniature eliciting similar kinds of response.[Jonathan Tavares and Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The sampler is divided roughly into two parts, with the natural world presented at the top and geometric motifs below.Spot samplers may have come closest to fulfilling the etymological destiny of the sampler, or exemplar, as ""an example to be imitated; a model, pattern; an archetype."" They are composed of collections of patterns and stitches to which the maker might refer when she was in need of inspiration or guidance for a particular technique. They generally do not include a date or a name in the body of the work that would allow a connection to be made with an embroiderer at a certain point in her education.A. J. B. Wace cited the existence of samplers as early as the beginning of the sixteenth century, writing that one was purchased for Elizabeth of York, who died in 1503, and that Elizabeth, Countess of Oxford, who died in 1537, left her two sisters twelve samplers in her will, although it is not clear that these were the work of her own hand. The earliest extant English sampler is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum; it was inscribed and dated by Jane Bostock in 1598. A sampler with a very similar composition to the present example composed of tent-stitch slips and animals above a group of geometric designs worked in silk and metal threads, is also in the Victoria and Albert Museum (inv. no. T.234-1928). Spot samplers were originally dated to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century, but more recently they have been reassigned to the mid-seventeenth century on the basis of a group of dated spot samplers that Carol Humphrey has brought to light. Spot samplers are relatively rare survivals compared to seventeenth century band samplers, which may result from their continuing usefulness as pattern references, a function that would have worn them out. The fact that these are rarely dated or signed may indicate that some are the work of professional teachers or embroiderers, in which case they would not have been treasured and saved by the descendants of the makers in the same way as ""schoolgirl"" accomplishments. Nevertheless, early in their existence they were certainly valued by the women who actually referred to them. The manner in which the maker of this sampler used materials and the fact that several individual motifs in this piece were left half-finished suggest that this is the first draft of a final work. Once the maker had mastered the technique and produced enough of the design to judge the final effect, there was no need to waste precious materials, particularly metal threads, and time in completing the motif.Geometric patterns similar to those found on this sampler were used on small purses and other decorative accessories; a cushion in the Colonial Williamsburg collection (inv. no. 1967-62), for example, is decorated with a similar diamond-shaped motif. It has been suggested that the tent-stitch motifs, or slips, on spot samplers were intended to be cut out and applied to another ground fabric for the production of valances, bed hangings, or cushion covers. It seems more likely that these were intended to be saved as design ideas rather than used in another end product. Surviving unused slips suggest that when these were worked in any quantity for use in appliqué, they were organized methodically in rows of identical motifs, rather than squeezed into the available space at different angles of orientation.[Emily Zilber, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The top two-thirds of the sampler includes motifs easily classifiable into standard categories, such as alphabetic characters, geometric designs, and floral motifs, worked in silk and linen on a linen ground using several common stitch techniques. An embroidered alphabet marks the end of the top third of the piece. The middle third is worked with white thread on a white ground, a technique commonly known as whitework. This middle section features scattered design motifs and concludes with an embroidered rendering of the maker’s name and dates of production.The bottom third of the piece is worked in reticella, a technique that originated in the late fifteenth century. The technique developed from cutwork and utilized stitches common to embroidery. Threads were pulled from a plain weave linen fabric to create open spaces in which a design was completed and the deconstructed fabric was stabilized primarily with buttonhole stitches. The result is a design based on the grid of the foundation fabric, with open areas throughout and arched and scalloped borders. Subsequently, the technique progressed to the point where the foundation fabric was eliminated and the design was worked over threads temporarily secured to a piece of vellum or paper for stability during the construction of what was called punto in aria (literally, ""stitches in air""), or early needle lace.Designs for reticella were popularized through numerous editions of late sixteenth-century Continental pattern books. Copies of these books made their way into England, and their popularity occasioned the publication of English pattern books, mostly consisting of patterns copied from the earlier book.Although cutwork and needle-lace techniques continued to be popular, especially for fashionable accessories, through the 1630s, there are very few examples of these techniques that have been attributed to English manufacture, despite the number of English samplers that confirm these skills were taught. The finest lace was imported, although the cost was certainly prohibitive for all but the elite. Therefore, the cultivation of practical skill in whitework and lace techniques would enable the maker to produce all manner of trimming necessary to fashionable attire. This sampler was purchased by London’s Royal School of Needlework in 1916; and it is quite possible that it continued to fulfill its seventeenth-century function of being an exemplar for early twentieth-century students.Samplers containing whitework, cutwork, and needle lace were attempted after basic skills were already mastered, if the case of Martha Edlin can be considered typical. She created her polychrome band sampler first and then move on to the more challenging whitework and cutwork embroidery. Women’s training in this standard progression of technical skills was an extraordinarily important part of a seventeenth-century education, particularly for daughters of the upper class and gentry. According to the household accounts of the Verney family, at least two hours each day were set aside for the practice of embroidery under the instruction of a tutor. It was decided that Sir Ralph Verney’s eight-year-old daughter, ""being a girl she shall not learn Latin, so she will have more time to learn breeding [manners] hereafter and needlework too."" Training in embroidery not only prepared a girl in practical necessities, but it also held a moral dimension. Richard Braithwaite in his 1631 text The English Gentlewoman noted that textile production should be considered ""arguments of [her] industry, memorials of [her] piety."" Women were educated in preparation for marriage, to run a household, and to be a good Christian. Verses from the Bible were often read aloud as women performed household sewing and embroidery, instilling the very activity of working with a needle with pious associations.The use of all three embroidery types—colored, whitework, and lace techniques—on a band sampler is relatively rare compared with simpler combinations of colored bands and whitework. As previously noted, it is uncertain how much actual needle-lace trimming was produced in England during the mid-seventeenth century, but there is a relatively large number of surviving whitework samplers dated to the 1640s. Particularly notable are examples that include figural compositions with detached elements.[Emily Zilber, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The text describes a painting displayed in the Temple of Saturn in Thebes that showed the journey through life and the pathway to true happiness. This hanging depicts the penultimate episode in the journey: the protagonist is beckoned from his path by a woman representing False Learning. Elegant figures in courtly dress are distracted from true wisdom and happiness by dedicating too much energy to the pursuit of knowledge through debate, philosophy, geometry, astrology and alchemy, geography, astronomy, arithmetic, and music.This hanging is one of a set of three (the others are in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris and the Metropolitan Museum). Their design was adapted from a woodcut illustrating The Table of Cebes made by David Kandel of Strasbourg in 1547. Notwithstanding the difference in scale (the woodcut is just over 12 by 15 inches), the designer of the embroidery borrowed the principal figures from the woodcut's central scene, inventively adding a warm palette of greens, reds, and yellows. The whole is enclosed by an imaginative border of cavorting grotesques and includes the coat of arms of the De Fenis de Prade family surrounded by the collar of the Order of Saint Michael (upper left) and a second unidentified armorial enclosed by a widow's cordeliere (upper right).

The 1601 inventory of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury (1527—1608), included two quilts that were almost certainly products of this trade: ""a quilt of yellow India stuff embroidered with birds and beasts"" and ""a quilt of India stuff embroidered with beastes.""¹ Indian quilts of the type produced for the Portuguese market appeared with increasing frequency in London sales into the 1620s, when their value began to decline, perhaps because of diminishing novelty.²The taste for Indian-style embroidery remained, however, and it is interesting to note that the English maker of another bedcover in the Museum's collection (MMA 34.104.1) used not only the Indian palette of golden yellow on white but also an imported Indian cotton as the foundation. The cover has rare seventeenth-century marks on the plain-weave cotton fabric: the initials G.C.E. (for the English East India Company's original name, The Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies) as well as three other stamps whose significance has not yet been deciphered.³ On that bedcover, the embroidered designs draw heavily on such exotic motifs as pineapple-like vegetation and serrated leaves, but contemporary European sensibilities are also evident in the strapwork connecting the floral elements. Additionally, the three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the use of stitches with long floats that create a shinier surface to contrast with the matte appearance of the cotton ground diverge from the Indian prototypes, whose flatter chain stitches are less glossy. English bedcovers were usually part of coordinated sets that could include bolsters, pillows, and matching valances.⁴In addition to the more common monochrome yellow-on white embroideries, Indian polychrome embroideries also arrived in England during the early seventeenth century. They, too, are described in sale records; for example, a 1614 sale included ""a carpet or quilt embroidered upon calico with sundry silks.""⁵ The word ""carpet"" is probably used in its contemporaneous sense, that is, to signify decorative covers for a variety of furniture types, including beds. This textile, an English polychrome silk and metal-thread bedcover, is more obviously dependent on the stylistic composition of Persian and Turkish carpets than MMA 34.104.1.  By the eighteenth century, both embroidered and painted cotton textiles of this type, with a central medallion and smaller medallions in the corners of the central field, were being made in India for domestic consumption and for export (see e.g. Winterthur Museum no. 1963.0048 and Victoria and Albert Museum no. IS.46-1956).⁶ These imported polychrome covers had a lasting influence on the production of English embroidered bed furnishings of the eighteenth century.

"http://data.silknow.org/object/6130e36b-707d-3519-b95d-675d0a94d85d","http://data.silknow.org/graph/met","This casket, the largest in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection of embroidered boxes, contains a multitude of objects, from glass bottles, which were typically fitted into boxes of the period, to a large array of sewing implements and materials, including 25 paper thread winders made from folded playing cards, several ivory thread winders, a bodkin, three ivory embroidery tools, a spool of gold filé thread, a silk tassel, several loose skeins of silk thread, a silk needle case, and a piece of detached buttonhole stitch fabric. Some of the objects clearly do not match the casket’s seventeenth-century date. Thread, both dyed silk and metal varieties, was purchased by weight, and the number of objects devoted to the organization of threads speaks to the value of this material. Decorated boxes intended to store sewing implements, among other things, were known on the Continent as well as in England; several seventeenth-century Dutch cushion-shaped containers survive, and seventeenth-century genre paintings confirm their practical use as supports for sewing.The completion of a decorated casket or cabinet would have been considered the culmination of a young woman’s education in needlework skills, and a few boxes have survived that can be firmly attributed to schoolgirls. Martha Edlin’s dated embroidered objects form the most complete record we have of one person’s output in the seventeenth century (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), although professional contributions at any point in the work would certainly have been possible. The exuberance of the decoration and the rather indiscriminate combination of materials and techniques suggest that this casket is the work of an amateur. Contrast this with the cabinet illustrating scenes from the Life of Joseph (MMA, 39.13.3a-k), which was executed in a single technique (laid and couched silk) and precisely and evenly worked on all faces of the box. This casket also lacks the consistency of theme present on most cabinets; the top of the lid shows the meeting of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, whereas the side panels are apparently random combinations of motifs typical of the period: heraldic animals, a castle, and a fountain, all surrounded by oversized flora and fauna. It is possible that the embroidered panels of this casket may have been applied to the wood carcass at a date significantly later than the execution of the decoration. The carcass itself is too large for the embroidered panels; the gaps where the satin foundation fabric does not cover the wood are patched with more silk and disguised with metal bobbin lace. The color and style of the lining—green silk with a padded main compartment—differ from most other boxes of the seventeenth century as well. Another casket in the Lady Lever Art Gallery collection has a similar padded interior, but the silk lining is described as the typical salmon-pink color.Nevertheless, this casket is important for its possible association with a mirror in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection (MMA, 39.13.2a). The back of the mirror frame is marked with the initials A.P. and the date 1672, and the casket contains thread holders or winders and a metal bodkin marked with the same initials. Both of these objects were in the collection of Percival Griffiths, and early scholars assumed that they were the work of the same maker. Although the mirror frame displays a more skilled and certain command of techniques and materials, it does contain some unusual elements, such as actual shells used in the decoration of the grotto. G. Saville Seligman and Talbot Hughes mentioned ""Lady Ann Paulet, who was a very accomplished broiderer"" in association with these embroideries, possibly referring to a lady-in-waiting to Queen Mary II (1662–1694), but no other evidence exists to support this attribution. The uncertain date of the construction of the casket, along with the survival of various tools and accessories, speaks to the continued significance of embroidery in the lives of women beyond the seventeenth century.[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

In addition to clothing and accessories, mirror frames, writing boxes, table covers, and pictures were decorated with embroidery. Prints served as sources for figures, flowers, and animals, which were drawn onto the fabric and given to the embroideresses. Frequently depicted themes include Old Testament stories, political subjects, allegories, and scenes of daily life. Musical Garden Party presents activities at a country house. In a formal garden, ladies perform for an appreciative male audience. By using fine-gauge canvas and silk threads, the embroideress was able to capture many fashion details such as feathered hats, lace trimming, and the floral pattern of a gown.

Samplers from this area are characterized by bands of colorful patterns. Girls stitched these bands to practice patterns for ""vernaaide linten,"" ribbons that were attached to a cap and which were an important part of the costume tradition on Marken Island. These ribbons consisted of black embroidery on white linen. The women of Marken are said to have kept their samplers in or near their kitchens for handy reference, so much of the needlework appears darkened from residue from cooking fires. Samplers from this area, including this one, often include striped horses.

Small elements—fruits, flowers, and leaves—were worked in tent stitch on canvas and then applied to the dark velvet foundation on which was worked the river in the Garden of Eden, the figures of Adam and Eve, and God the Father, in polychrome silk and metal threads. The garden is monumental, almost overwhelming the figures. The three trees that anchor the composition would have brought to mind the biblical description of trees in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. The scene of Adam and Eve being expelled from Eden on the far right may also derive from a reading of contemporary vernacular English Bibles, rather than any pictorial convention. Adam and Eve wear garments that suggest articles of late Elizabethan dress and the Geneva Bible of 1560 referred to their first clothes as ""breeches.""

It is thought that samplers containing whitework, cutwork, drawnwork, and lace designs were stitched only after multi-colored band samplers were finished, as whitework techniques are more difficult. However, this theory is based on a the very small number of documented seventeenth-century embroiderers who made multiple samplers. This sampler includes bands of acorns and stylized flowers, in addition to four bands of cutwork and drawnwork featuring star and geometric patterns.

The Ricasolis, an ancient aristocratic dynasty, also owned a Palazzo in via Maggio 7, Florence which also contained a private theatre.

The stiffness, embroidery and cut of the costume suggest that it was used for dancing. The hessian lining would have preserved the shape of the costume and the silver embroidery would have sparkled in the candlelight as the performer moved. The hemming on the left panel of the coat would also reveal the movement of the dancer's leg.

The stage coat is similar in style to a 'banyan' or morning coat, a popular style in the mid-eighteenth century, suggesting that it may have been re-purposed from a fashion garment. The costume also bears evidence of alterations in the nineteenth century.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

A portrait of an unknown man (once thought to be Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham) in the National Portrait Gallery shows the sitter in one of these decorative night cap, with a linen lining with earflaps, similar to this object.  The earflaps and linen ties on this cap liner suggest that it might also have been worn while the wearer was sleeping. There are very few surviving images depicting people in their bed clothes in the 1600s, so it is difficult to know exactly what they wore.  Unlike the embroidered caps, this one is made of a rectangle of linen gathered into a circle of fabric at the crown. The cap is very finely hand-sewn to withstand the rigours of laundry done by hand.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Pine carcase covered in Chinese white silk damask with details in crimson silk velvet (probably Italian) with a crimson fringe. The top crestings and corner finials are of cut pine covered with velvet. The cantoons or subsidiary curtains, are projected on curved iron supports. English between 1692 and 1707. Given by the Rt. Hon. the Earl of Leven.

The bed was made for George Melville, (b.1636, d.1707) who was created Earl of Melville in 1690; his monogram, GM, repeated in reverse, occurs on both the coverlet and the head-board, below the Earl's coronets which are repeated on the top cresting. The bed came from Melville House, Fife designed in 1692. This magnificent bed, in a remarkably fine state of preservation, has strong claims to be regarded as the finest specimen of the period and is an excellent example of the influence of the designs of Daniel Marot. [1968]
British Galleries:
This bed was commissioned by George, 1st Earl of Melville, for his new house in Fife. He had spent many years in The Netherlands at the court of William of Orange, later William III, before returning to Scotland. His new house reflected his knowledge of the most recent European fashion in furnishings. The bed was never intended for everyday use but, een so, the survival of its original silk and velvet hangings is exceptioanlly rare. [27/03/2003]

George, 1st Earl of Melville (1634-1707)

The 1st Earl of Melville and Melville House
George, 1st Earl of Melville (about 1634-1707), built Melville House to celebrate his family's return to favour in Scotland after a period of exile at the court of William of Orange in the Netherlands. Melville's great opportunity had come when he followed William and Mary to Britain after they became joint monarchs in 1689. He was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland in 1689, then created 1st Earl of Melville in 1690.  As Lord Privy Seal (1691) and President of the Council (from 1696), Melville remained loyal to William at a time when the king's authority was unpopular with many in Scotland. Melville's decision to build a new house reflected his concern with his own status as one of the King's representatives. [133]

The house was also an expression of family pride.  Prominent on the headboard of the bed is the Earl's monogram. The bed may well have been ordered to celebrate the union in 1698 of the two earldoms, of Melville and of Leven. The Earl's younger son, David, had inherited the Earldom of Leven in 1681 through his mother. Following the unexpected death of his older brother, Alexander in 1698, David also became heir to the Earldom of Melville. [70]

Elevation of Melville House by James Smith
Melville House
Melville House was built between 1697 and 1703 and stands surrounded by farmland, about 40 miles from Edinburgh.  For the Earl of Melville it was an imposing statement of his wealth and political success, and a monument to family status. The house was designed by James Smith (about 1646-1729), one of the leading Scottish mason-architects, in the Palladian style, with a plain, symmetrical exterior. The ground floor contained rooms for daily living, including the Earl's bedroom, while the grandest rooms of 'state' or display stood on the first floor. [90]

The state bedroom was the climax of a series of rooms fitted with the best oak panelling and marble fireplaces. The route for visitors to the house led from the great staircase, hung with family portraits, to a great panelled room for entertaining. From this an apartment led off on either side, each consisting of a drawing room, bedroom, dressing room and small private closet. The basement housed the kitchen and other services, while smaller rooms on the top floor were for other members of the household and servants. [87]

State beds
Although state beds were commissioned to provide for the possibility of a visit from a monarch, their main function was for show and they were rarely used. They were the most elaborate item of furnishing in a set of state apartments and their sumptuous textiles and trimmings were famously expensive, reflecting the riches and power of the owner. The tester (or canopy) was itself an ancient symbol of authority, similar to the canopies that still traditionally hang above thrones.  [80]

State bedrooms were usually panelled in oak and often hung with tapestries. The upholstery of chairs and stools matched the hangings of the bed, while window curtains might be in lighter silk. Floors were not carpeted and to modern eyes would look bare. Pine floors were dry-scrubbed with sand to keep them light in colour. In the area of the bed itself the floor might be covered with strips of 'Portugal matting', a light rush-matting imported from North Africa. 

The taste for complex upholstered decoration for state beds came from the work of the French-born court designer Daniel Marot (1661-1752).  His etchings of interiors and beds were published as collected sets from 1697 but Lord Melville would already have known the interiors that Marot had designed for William of Orange at his palaces in the Netherlands from 1686 onwards. It is possible that Marot designed this bed. [98]

The upholstery and his work
Like most state beds in Britain, this one would have been designed and made in London. Although the upholsterer is unknown, one likely supplier was Francis Lapiere (1653-1714), who was born in France and probably trained in Paris. He settled in London before 1683 and supplied upholstery and beds for several of the grandest country houses. [66]

The crimson velvet would have been imported from Italy, while the ivory white silk damask came from China. The trimmings would have been ordered from specialist makers, either in London or on the Continent. The upholsterer's team would also have supplied and installed the wooden frame, hemp cord, iron brackets and mattresses. The upholsterer himself might have gone to Scotland for such a prestigious commission.  [76]

The rich hangings conceal a plain oak frame. The three-dimensional ornament on the headboard and tester was created by gluing silk and braid onto a rigid, carved frame. Some of the most dramatic elements of the design were simply created by gathering the fabrics into festoons, pleats or large, loose rosettes known as choux. [72]

The Melville bed   [heading]
About 1700
Unlike most surviving beds of this date, which have been stripped and covered with new silk at some time, the Melville bed retains all its original upholstery and hangings. The ivory silk even carries a weaver's mark in Chinese characters.

Possibly designed by Daniel Marot (born in Paris 1661, died in the Netherlands, 1752); probably upholstered in London by Francis Lapiere (born 1653, active in Britain from about 1683, died in London, 1714)

The conservation of the Bed
In the clean air of rural Scotland the bed had survived remarkably well, but the polluted air of London had taken its toll since the bed arrived at the V&A in 1949.  In 1985 Museum staff started a programme of cleaning and conservation that was to last 10 years and involve 12 conservators.  Over 4,500 hours of work were spent cleaning and repairing of the bed. Even after this work, it still could not be put on show, because the old British Galleries lacked any form of air-conditioning and the dirt would have gathered again.  Now it is possible once again to show the bed, though even in air-conditioned galleries it must be cased to preserve its fine condition for later generations. [106]

The State Bedroom on the principal floor of the house  was approached from the Great Staircase, hung with family portraits, via the Big Dining Room and Drawing Room.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/05606757-beff-3e1a-b594-cc083530c640","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","The bed was listed as in the State Bedroom at Melville House in 1837 ( Inventory of Melville House, Fife, 1837, from the Marquis of Ailsa's papers, Scottish Record Office, Edinburgh GD25/9/31/3A). Melville House was designed by the Scottish architect James Smith (c.1646-1729), it was begun in 1697 and the final masonry work and roof only completed in the summer of 1699. It would have been furnished in the next year, and the family papers record that Lord Melville was buying tapestries in London from September to December 1700. There are no surviving bills for the State Bed.
The West facing State Bedroom was on the Principal Floor of  Melville House, and the State Bed was intended as a symbol of  Lord Melville's authority. The State Bedroom formed the climax of a series of  State Apartments approached from the Great Staircase to the North of the house, which was hung with family portraits including those of the 1st Earl and Countess of Melville by Sir John Baptist Medina. The Great Staircase led on the Principal Floor to the South facing Big Dining Room which at the time of  George Melville's death was hung with four tapestries and furnished with a scrutoir (desk), a painted screen, a dozen turkey-work chairs and two tables, one oval and one square. A Drawing Room led from the Big Dining Room to the State Bedchamber. The latter was serviced by a Dressing Room, Closet and Back Stairs. The State Bedchamber opened directly into an Antichamber which in turn led to the Great Staircase Landing. The sequence of rooms is derived from a plan of the Principal and Vestibule Floors of Melville House which was drawn in 1733 to accompany an account of the lightening which struck Melville House during a storm on 27th October 1733 (Melville Papers, Scottish Record Office, GD 26/13/272). There is no detailed description of the other contents of the State Bedroom, but there is no evidence in the family papers that this room was used during the 18th century. It was created in order to receive the monarch,William III. But King William never visited Scotland. By 1733, George Melville's eldest son, David, 2nd Earl of  Melville and 3rd Earl of Leven occupied 'My Lord's Bedchamber' directly below the State Bedchamber on the Vestibule floor. In 1707 the earl's bedroom had been furnished with 'a dark colour mohair bed with a blue casnet (sarsnet) lineing/embroidered and a covering of /that same, a guilded cornice/ and feet conforme' the hangings more practical for everyday use that those on the State Bed. The other furniture included  two tapestry hangings, an agate cabinet, a walnut cabinet with a table, pair of candlestands and mirror en suite, an easy chair, six cane chairs, a cabinet for holding papers and a little writing table'.

The Country Life photograph of the bedroom shows mid-eighteenth century chairs, covered in matching velvet. There is no evidence that the State Bed was originally accompanied by upholstered chairs en suite as shown in contemporary designs by Daniel Marot.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/05606757-beff-3e1a-b594-cc083530c640","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","The bedstead consists of an oak bedstock with four oak posts secured to the rails with bolts, the posts chamfered above the bottom rails to become octagonal. The frame of the bed retains its original ropes and and linen ticking (twill in the light areas and plain-weave elsewhere) which are attached to the side and foot stock rails and a tension baton at the head of the bed. This was originally tightened by bolts (now missing) through the head rail. It has subsequently been tightened by being folded over and refixed to the tension baton. The side edges of the linen ticking are strengthened with piping and attached to the side linen sections by ropes inserted through eyelet holes strengthened with linen thread.  The top of each post has two iron hooks to secure the curtain rods. The top of the posts hold iron spikes which  secure the tester and cornice. Each of the posts have silk damask covers lined with linen. The pine tester has a horizontal subframe with a hole at each corner which slots over the spikes on the top of the posts.  The pine cornice frame also slots over the spikes above the tester sub-frame and is separated from the latter by oak spacers which are now attached to the cornice frame. The tester consists of a pine structure of thick upright sides resting on the subframe. The sides support  six pierced coved sections built up in facetted boards to achieve a coved interior - one at each corner and one in the middle of each side. The corner sections are attached to the upright sides by nails. The middle sections are attached by pine boards, nailed to the pierced sections, with holes which slot over iron eyes set into the upright sides and anchored with nails slotted through these eyes.

The tester cloth is of a different cream Chinese silk to the bed curtain linings and counterpane. At the head selvedge is a Chinese inscription. The central cartouche is made with thick pine boards curved up (by steaming?) at each end, forming a large central oval. In the centre is a smaller oval stepped to overlap the outer and providing support for yet another smaller oval. Rings in the top of the main boards provide the means of attachment to the middle sections of the coving. Traces of pencil drawings on the underside of the tester cloth provided rough guidelines for the passementerie of  braid and fringe although these were not always followed.

The outer cornice of the upper framework is covered with crimson velvet with crimson fringe. The support six(?) coronets, a pair on each side and a pair at the foot end with at the corners four acanthus leaf scrolls.  Two iron cantoon arms on brackets are fixed to the cornice frame. These support velvet cantoons, which are stiffened with linen and have separate silk linings.  The cantoons are curved at the ends (gathered by long linen stitches) and fringed all round the edges.  The cantoons are tied up with cords with tassels at each end. The velvet upper outer valances are attached to the tester frame. The silk inner upper valances are attached to the inside of  the tester frame. 

The head board similarly covered with cream silk and embellished with crimson silk braid and fringe supports a cresting of pierced acanthus plumage, and is embellished with the joint monogram of George, first Earl of Melville and his wife, Catherine. The outer scrolls support two Earl's coronets which are symbolic of  the patrons' noble status. 

Above the headboard, the head curtain of silk damask is gathered in loose vertical folds accross the centre section. It is attached to the upper framework behind the inner valance at the top, the head posts at either side and behind the carved headboard at the bottom. It is embellished with two drapes consisting of gathered silk curtains edged with crimson fringe and lined with linen. The drapes have attachments at the upper and lower fixing points consisting of choux and tassels.

There are two foot curtains and two head curtains. The foot curtains are made of five panels of velvet 50 cms wide and one panel of 10 cm wide which was designed to fit round the corner with short fringe down its seam sand a longer fringe on the bottom edge. The linings are in widths of 69 cms. The curtains end approximately 18 cms from the floor. Both curtains have cords attached to the top ends with tassels at the ends for pulling the curtains along the rods.  The head curtains are made up of two 50 cm widths of velvet. The base valances are attached to the base rail and are in two sections. The upper section consists of a pine moulding to which braid and velvet are glued and nailed with fringes at the top and the bottom. The lower sections consists of a valance similar to the upper valances with swags, bells and tassels on cords. 

The coverlet, a remarkable survival, is of silk damask embroidered with crimson braid and fringe. The central cartouche frames the Earl's monogram beneath an Earl's coronet with a pendant of simulated tasseled fringe embroidered in crimson braid. The outer borders of the coverlet are decorated with crimson fringe to form an effective edging where the counterpane is turned down to cover the sides and end of the bed. The coverlet has a specially shaped section to cover the bolster.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

Melville House was designed by the Scottish architect James Smith (c.1646-1729), it was begun in 1697 and the final masonry work and roof only completed in the summer of 1699. It would have been furnished in the next year, and the family papers record that Lord Melville was buying tapestries in London from September to December 1700. There are no surviving bills for the State Bed.
The West facing State Bedroom was on the Principal Floor of  Melville House, and the State Bed was intended as a symbol of  Lord Melville's authority. The State Bedroom formed the climax of a series of  State Apartments approached from the Great Staircase to the North of the house, which was hung with family portraits including those of the 1st Earl and Countess of Melville by Sir John Baptist Medina. The Great Staircase led on the Principal Floor to the South facing Big Dining Room which at the time of  George Melville's death was hung with four tapestries and furnished with a scrutoir (desk), a painted screen, a dozen turkey-work chairs and two tables, one oval and one square. A Drawing Room led from the Big Dining Room to the State Bedchamber. The latter was serviced by a Dressing Room, Closet and Back Stairs. The State Bedchamber opened directly into an Antichamber which in turn led to the Great Staircase Landing. The sequence of rooms is derived from a plan of the Principal and Vestibule Floors of Melville House which was drawn in 1733 to accompany an account of the lightening which struck Melville House during a storm on 27th October 1733 (Melville Papers, Scottish Record Office, GD 26/13/272). There is no detailed description of the other contents of the State Bedroom, but there is no evidence in the family papers that this room was used during the 18th century. It was created in order to receive the monarch,William III. But King William never visited Scotland. By 1733, George Melville's eldest son, David, 2nd Earl of  Melville and 3rd Earl of Leven occupied 'My Lord's Bedchamber' directly below the State Bedchamber on the Vestibule floor. In 1707 the earl's bedroom had been furnished with 'a dark colour mohair bed with a blue casnet (sarsnet) lineing/embroidered and a covering of /that same, a guilded cornice/ and feet conforme' the hangings more practical for everyday use that those on the State Bed. The other furniture included  two tapestry hangings, an agate cabinet, a walnut cabinet with a table, pair of candlestands and mirror en suite, an easy chair, six cane chairs, a cabinet for holding papers and a little writing table'.

The Country Life photograph of the bedroom shows mid-eighteenth century chairs, covered in matching velvet. There is no evidence that the State Bed was originally accompanied by upholstered chairs en suite as shown in contemporary designs by Daniel Marot.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Pine carcase covered in Chinese white silk damask with details in crimson silk velvet (probably Italian) with a crimson fringe. The top crestings and corner finials are of cut pine covered with velvet. The cantoons or subsidiary curtains, are projected on curved iron supports. English between 1692 and 1707. Given by the Rt. Hon. the Earl of Leven.

The bed was made for George Melville, (b.1636, d.1707) who was created Earl of Melville in 1690; his monogram, GM, repeated in reverse, occurs on both the coverlet and the head-board, below the Earl's coronets which are repeated on the top cresting. The bed came from Melville House, Fife designed in 1692. This magnificent bed, in a remarkably fine state of preservation, has strong claims to be regarded as the finest specimen of the period and is an excellent example of the influence of the designs of Daniel Marot. [1968]
British Galleries:
This bed was commissioned by George, 1st Earl of Melville, for his new house in Fife. He had spent many years in The Netherlands at the court of William of Orange, later William III, before returning to Scotland. His new house reflected his knowledge of the most recent European fashion in furnishings. The bed was never intended for everyday use but, een so, the survival of its original silk and velvet hangings is exceptioanlly rare. [27/03/2003]

George, 1st Earl of Melville (1634-1707)

The 1st Earl of Melville and Melville House
George, 1st Earl of Melville (about 1634-1707), built Melville House to celebrate his family's return to favour in Scotland after a period of exile at the court of William of Orange in the Netherlands. Melville's great opportunity had come when he followed William and Mary to Britain after they became joint monarchs in 1689. He was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland in 1689, then created 1st Earl of Melville in 1690.  As Lord Privy Seal (1691) and President of the Council (from 1696), Melville remained loyal to William at a time when the king's authority was unpopular with many in Scotland. Melville's decision to build a new house reflected his concern with his own status as one of the King's representatives. [133]

The house was also an expression of family pride.  Prominent on the headboard of the bed is the Earl's monogram. The bed may well have been ordered to celebrate the union in 1698 of the two earldoms, of Melville and of Leven. The Earl's younger son, David, had inherited the Earldom of Leven in 1681 through his mother. Following the unexpected death of his older brother, Alexander in 1698, David also became heir to the Earldom of Melville. [70]

Elevation of Melville House by James Smith
Melville House
Melville House was built between 1697 and 1703 and stands surrounded by farmland, about 40 miles from Edinburgh.  For the Earl of Melville it was an imposing statement of his wealth and political success, and a monument to family status. The house was designed by James Smith (about 1646-1729), one of the leading Scottish mason-architects, in the Palladian style, with a plain, symmetrical exterior. The ground floor contained rooms for daily living, including the Earl's bedroom, while the grandest rooms of 'state' or display stood on the first floor. [90]

The state bedroom was the climax of a series of rooms fitted with the best oak panelling and marble fireplaces. The route for visitors to the house led from the great staircase, hung with family portraits, to a great panelled room for entertaining. From this an apartment led off on either side, each consisting of a drawing room, bedroom, dressing room and small private closet. The basement housed the kitchen and other services, while smaller rooms on the top floor were for other members of the household and servants. [87]

State beds
Although state beds were commissioned to provide for the possibility of a visit from a monarch, their main function was for show and they were rarely used. They were the most elaborate item of furnishing in a set of state apartments and their sumptuous textiles and trimmings were famously expensive, reflecting the riches and power of the owner. The tester (or canopy) was itself an ancient symbol of authority, similar to the canopies that still traditionally hang above thrones.  [80]

State bedrooms were usually panelled in oak and often hung with tapestries. The upholstery of chairs and stools matched the hangings of the bed, while window curtains might be in lighter silk. Floors were not carpeted and to modern eyes would look bare. Pine floors were dry-scrubbed with sand to keep them light in colour. In the area of the bed itself the floor might be covered with strips of 'Portugal matting', a light rush-matting imported from North Africa. 

The taste for complex upholstered decoration for state beds came from the work of the French-born court designer Daniel Marot (1661-1752).  His etchings of interiors and beds were published as collected sets from 1697 but Lord Melville would already have known the interiors that Marot had designed for William of Orange at his palaces in the Netherlands from 1686 onwards. It is possible that Marot designed this bed. [98]
 
[Image of Marot design for a bed]

The upholstery and his work
Like most state beds in Britain, this one would have been designed and made in London. Although the upholsterer is unknown, one likely supplier was Francis Lapiere (1653-1714), who was born in France and probably trained in Paris. He settled in London before 1683 and supplied upholstery and beds for several of the grandest country houses. [66]

The crimson velvet would have been imported from Italy, while the ivory white silk damask came from China. The trimmings would have been ordered from specialist makers, either in London or on the Continent. The upholsterer's team would also have supplied and installed the wooden frame, hemp cord, iron brackets and mattresses. The upholsterer himself might have gone to Scotland for such a prestigious commission.  [76]

The rich hangings conceal a plain oak frame. The three-dimensional ornament on the headboard and tester was created by gluing silk and braid onto a rigid, carved frame. Some of the most dramatic elements of the design were simply created by gathering the fabrics into festoons, pleats or large, loose rosettes known as choux. [72]

The Melville bed   [heading]
About 1700
Unlike most surviving beds of this date, which have been stripped and covered with new silk at some time, the Melville bed retains all its original upholstery and hangings. The ivory silk even carries a weaver's mark in Chinese characters.

Possibly designed by Daniel Marot (born in Paris 1661, died in the Netherlands, 1752); probably upholstered in London by Francis Lapiere (born 1653, active in Britain from about 1683, died in London, 1714)

The conservation of the Bed
In the clean air of rural Scotland the bed had survived remarkably well, but the polluted air of London had taken its toll since the bed arrived at the V&A in 1949.  In 1985 Museum staff started a programme of cleaning and conservation that was to last 10 years and involve 12 conservators.  Over 4,500 hours of work were spent cleaning and repairing of the bed. Even after this work, it still could not be put on show, because the old British Galleries lacked any form of air-conditioning and the dirt would have gathered again.  Now it is possible once again to show the bed, though even in air-conditioned galleries it must be cased to preserve its fine condition for later generations. [106]

This embroidery hung in a bedroom at Stoke Edith, Herefordshire (seen here in a photograph of  1909). The formal garden shown here may represent the real garden at Stoke Edith or may be a composite image of fashionable garden designs of the period.  Another embroidery (see photograph, right) showed a related garden scene. Family tradition described them as the work of members of the household, but their huge scale and the consistent quality of the embroidery indicate that they must have been made in a professional workshop. The building of Stoke Edith as a residence for Paul Foley (about 1645-1699), Speaker of the House of Commons, was started in 1697. [27/03/2003]

The frame of the bed retains its original ropes and and linen ticking (twill in the light areas and plain-weave elsewhere) which are attached to the side and foot stock rails and a tension baton at the head of the bed. This was originally tightened by bolts (now missing) through the head rail. It has subsequently been tightened by being folded over and refixed to the tension baton. The side edges of the linen ticking are strengthened with piping and attached to the side linen sections by ropes inserted through eyelet holes strengthened with linen thread.  The top of each post has two iron hooks to secure the curtain rods. The top of the posts hold iron spikes which  secure the tester and cornice. Each of the posts have silk damask covers lined with linen. The pine tester has a horizontal subframe with a hole at each corner which slots over the spikes on the top of the posts.  The pine cornice frame also slots over the spikes above the tester sub-frame and is separated from the latter by oak spacers which are now attached to the cornice frame. The tester consists of a pine structure of thick upright sides resting on the subframe. The sides support  six pierced coved sections built up in facetted boards to achieve a coved interior - one at each corner and one in the middle of each side. The corner sections are attached to the upright sides by nails. The middle sections are attached by pine boards, nailed to the pierced sections, with holes which slot over iron eyes set into the upright sides and anchored with nails slotted through these eyes.

The tester cloth is of a different cream Chinese silk to the bed curtain linings and counterpane. At the head selvedge is a Chinese inscription. The central cartouche is made with thick pine boards curved up (by steaming?) at each end, forming a large central oval. In the centre is a smaller oval stepped to overlap the outer and providing support for yet another smaller oval. Rings in the top of the main boards provide the means of attachment to the middle sections of the coving. Traces of pencil drawings on the underside of the tester cloth provided rough guidelines for the passementerie of  braid and fringe although these were not always followed.

The outer cornice of the upper framework is covered with crimson velvet with crimson fringe. The support six(?) coronets, a pair on each side and a pair at the foot end with at the corners four acanthus leaf scrolls.  Two iron cantoon arms on brackets are fixed to the cornice frame. These support velvet cantoons, which are stiffened with linen and have separate silk linings.  The cantoons are curved at the ends (gathered by long linen stitches) and fringed all round the edges.  The cantoons are tied up with cords with tassels at each end. The velvet upper outer valances are attached to the tester frame. The silk inner upper valances are attached to the inside of  the tester frame. 

The head board similarly covered with cream silk and embellished with crimson silk braid and fringe supports a cresting of pierced acanthus plumage, and is embellished with the joint monogram of George, first Earl of Melville and his wife, Catherine. The outer scrolls support two Earl's coronets which are symbolic of  the patrons' noble status. 

Above the headboard, the head curtain of silk damask is gathered in loose vertical folds accross the centre section. It is attached to the upper framework behind the inner valance at the top, the head posts at either side and behind the carved headboard at the bottom. It is embellished with two drapes consisting of gathered silk curtains edged with crimson fringe and lined with linen. The drapes have attachments at the upper and lower fixing points consisting of choux and tassels.

There are two foot curtains and two head curtains. The foot curtains are made of five panels of velvet 50 cms wide and one panel of 10 cm wide which was designed to fit round the corner with short fringe down its seam sand a longer fringe on the bottom edge. The linings are in widths of 69 cms. The curtains end approximately 18 cms from the floor. Both curtains have cords attached to the top ends with tassels at the ends for pulling the curtains along the rods.  The head curtains are made up of two 50 cm widths of velvet. The base valances are attached to the base rail and are in two sections. The upper section consists of a pine moulding to which braid and velvet are glued and nailed with fringes at the top and the bottom. The lower sections consists of a valance similar to the upper valances with swags, bells and tassels on cords. 

The coverlet, a remarkable survival, is of silk damask embroidered with crimson braid and fringe. The central cartouche frames the Earl's monogram beneath an Earl's coronet with a pendant of simulated tasseled fringe embroidered in crimson braid. The outer borders of the coverlet are decorated with crimson fringe to form an effective edging where the counterpane is turned down to cover the sides and end of the bed. The coverlet has a specially shaped section to cover the bolster.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Some areas of applique with chain stitch (fruit trees in chinese pots). The design was drawn on the canvas prior to embroidery, and can be seen in some areas where the stitches have dropped out. From this evidence it appears that some small areas of the design (for example flowers) were not executed, or were worked differently from the original design. The canvas ground consists of four pieces of canvas running from side to side of the hanging: two complete loom widths of 93cms, one half width of 51 cms at the upper edge of the hanging, and one width of 81cms at the lower edge. The lower edge has been cut and it is possible that the embroidery was originally deeper. There may also be a section missing from the top of the embroidery. To the left of the centre there is an inverted L-shape cut which runs from the lower edge vertically for half the height and then horizontally to the right for a shorter distance, made for a door opening (visible in 1909 Country Life photograph) (darned across later).

The object forms a parallelogram, having been pulled into that shape by the tension produced by the embroidery.

The canvas is woven with 22 picks, 22 ends per inch (2.5cm).

The design is of a formal garden. It shows an orangery, a parterre, with two classical statues (Mercury and Bacchus) and a round basin with a fountain and statue of a putto riding on a dolphin, the corner of a larger pond (faced with flints, like a grotto ?), a wrought iron gate in the foreground, in the middle of a stone balustrade, with stone lions holding shields, one containing the arms of Knightly (Thomas Foley (d.1737) married Anne Knightly of Fawsley, Northants, c.1688), 14 lemon and orange trees in Chinese porcelain pots, decorated in blue and red on white ground, and urns, flower beds of brown earth with tulips and carnations in formal rows, standard clipped box trees in the centre of the beds, and yews at the corners, some with berries, two standard hollies with berries in urns on the balustrade, row of lilies in pots on the left, rows of miniature larch (?) trees, avenue of pine trees on the left, rick wall to either side of the orangery with espalier fruit trees, possibly grapes, peaches, figs and plums, archways through to the outside: on the left, a grove of trees behind a wall with church tower and flag, blue hills in the distance, and clouds, birds and animals: 2 swans, 2 peacocks, macaw, cockatoo, 3 spaniels, 1 chasing squirrel, and people: a couple by the fountain, a couple by the far left wall, and two men with a black page, far left edge.

This hood depicts Saint Thomas of Canterbury as bishop and is appropriate for the Kent church for which it was designed. The head is seen full-face, as in the manner of church brasses, a form advocated by Pugin. The embroidery is worked in the manner of <i>opus anglicanum</i> (English medieval work). This was much admired and aspired to in the mid-19th century by amateurs and an increasing number of professional church embroiderers. 

The embroidery is raised, padded and couched work.

In 1970 Jean-Paul Asselberghers, curator at the Musées royaux d'art et d'histoire in Brussels, presented the most recent interpretation of this and kindred panels. He suggested that this panel is one of four made for the Order of Vallombrosa. The others are in the Musée royaux d'Art et d'Histoire in Brussels and the Musée Cluny in Paris. All four panels match each other in size (to within two or three centimetres), in the disposition of nail holes round their edges, and in their embroidery technique and colours (although Asselberghers only actually studied firsthand the pieces in London and Brussels). Originally, in the late 19th century, the subjectmatter had been identified as two pairs: two panels of St Verdiana and two of St Dominic. He re-identified the saints, suggesting that each scene related to an incident in the life of a different saint revered by the Vallombrosans.

<b>Subjectmatter</b> 
Asselberghers identifies the scenes as: the death of Saint Verdiana (London); the funeral of St Umilita (Humility) Negosanti, foundress and abbess of  the convent of Saint John the Evangelist in Florence (now in Brussels); the blessed Pierre Igné successfully surviving trial by fire in 1067 in the presence of Saint John Gualberto (who had founded in 1055 a community in Vallombrosa which followed an adaptation of the Rule of St Benedict) (now in Paris); and St Arialde siezed by the order of the Archbishop of Milan (Paris). All four saints were venerated by the Vallombrosans. Indeed, St Arailde was canonised in 1075, the year following his death. On her death in 1310 St Umilita's corpse was laid out for several days so that the people could pay their respects, such was her popularity - hence the iconography of this panel which can be compared to a painted panel of the death of this saint which was part of a retable consecrated to scenes of the life of the saint, painted by Pietro Lorenzetti for the church of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Salvi in Florence in 1341 and now in the Musée des Offices (For further information, on St Umilita. St Verdiana were the only female saints venerated by the Vallombrosans. 

<b>St Verdiana</b> 
Born in Castelfiorentino in Tuscany in 1182, Verdiana or Viridiana Attavanti died in 1242 and was canonised in 1553, her feast day being February 1st. She made the pilgrimage to Santiago to Compostela before being walled up as a hermit in her native town in a cell adjoining the chapel of St Anthony, with two snakes as company. She lived in her cell for 34 years under the obedience of the Vallumbrosan abbey. The Franciscans claim her as a tertiary (i.e. a lay member of their order). Many miracles are ascribed to her; she is called upon in the litany of the Sick to intercede against snake bites. (D. Attwater. 1983. <i>The Penguin Dictionary of Saints</i>, 2nd ed. revised and updated by C.R. John, New York; www.catholicculture.org/lit/prayers Litany by Benjamin Francis Musser OFM  (Trinity Communications, 2006) [accessed January 2006]). 

<b>Function</b> 
Asselberhgers considers that stylistically the embroideries date to the first half of the 15th century (Examination of the dress depicted would suggest the same). He also suggests that the panels were probably most appropriate for use in an antependium on which three horizontal rows of two or three panels flanked a large central panel. He cites the antependium in the collegiate church of Manresa, Catalonia as an example of this type, embroidered in the 14th century.  He does not believe they are the right size for dalmatic panels.  

<b>Embroidery in 15th-century Italy</b> 
Embroidery was both a professional craft and a woman's accomplishment by the early 15th century, the quality and content of the needlework revealing the skill of the author. The identity of the author of the image is usually unknown although some well-known painters, such as Botticelli, made designs for embroidery. Like painting, embroideries could be narrative as well as decorative, the subjectmatter religious or secular. In this particular instance, the content of the embroidery suggests a devotional and didactic function. A focus for prayer, such images could act as behavioural models for their owners, and were usually kept in the more personal and private rooms in the houses of a wealthy family. (Paola Tinagli. <i>Women in Italian Renaissance Art. Gender, Representation and Identity</i>. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1997, Chapter 5 'The Cult of Female Saints: Images of Devotion and <i>Exempla</i>) It is therefore possible that this embroidery belonged to a woman who considered St Verdiana an appropriate role model because of her saintly behaviour if it was not a section of a larger embroidered piece for an altar frontal or an apparel for a dalmatic.  The existence of three other comparable panels suggests that that the altar frontal hypothesis may be most appropriate, though at a later date it could have been used as an inidivual image.

<b>St Verdiana in literature, art and film and Tuscany</b> 
Saint Verdiana is mentioned in Bocaccio, <i>DeCameron</i>, Day 5, Story 10.
She appears in Giovanni del Ponte’s Ascension of St John the Evangelist with saints, circa 1410-20 (National Gallery, London) in the habit of a Franciscan tertiary (?) holding a snake in each hand. The painting is inscribed, identifying the saints and she is at the bottom of the left pilaster. A good comparison with this imagery is that in Fra Angelico's Perugia tryptich from the predella of  the death of St Nicholas, on the left hand side of the bier (See Martin Davies, <i>Early Italian Schools</i>, 1986, p. 248). 

On his return to Spain from exile in 1960, Luis Buñuel made a Palme d’Or winning film, entitled Viridiana and based loosely on a nun who experiences a series of mortifications.

A Museum devoted to St Verdiana has recently opened in Castelfiorentino, near the Sanctuary of Santa Verdiana. It contains works of art by Taddeo Gaddi, Jacopo del Casentino, Francesco Granacci, the Maestro delle Effigi Domenicane, Benedetto da Maiano, Bernardo di Stefano Rosselli among others, as well as illumintated codices, wooden statues, terracottas, historic dress, liturgical and precious objects and reliquaries.

<b>Additional information on other panels</b> 
The Catholic Encyclopedia:[accessed May 2009] states:
'St. Umiltà is usually regarded as the foundress of the Vallumbrosan Nuns. She was born at Faenza about 1226, was married, but with the consent of her husband, who became a monk, entered a monastery of canonesses and afterwards became an anchoress in a cell attached to the Vallumbrosan church of Faenza, where she lived for twelve years. At the request of the abbot-general she then founded a monastery outside Faenza and became its abbess. In 1282 she founded a second convent at Florence, where she died in 1310. She left a number of mystical writings. In 1524 the nuns obtained the Abbey of S. Salvi, Florence. There are still Vallumbrosan nunneries at Faenza and S. Gimignano, besides two at Florence. The relics of Bl. Umiltà and her disciple Bl. Margherita are venerated at the convent of Spirito Santo at Varlungo. The habit is similar to that of the Benedictine Nuns.'","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

It is worked in fine multi-coloured silks and gold thread in split stitch on a linen or linen and cotton ground. The gold threads are worn but originally the background would have been shiny and bright. The high quality of the stitching indicates that the maker was a skilled craftsperson, either trained in a guild or in a convent. It is likely that the image was made for a space that was devoted to meditation or prayer. The maker and user may have been the same person. The similarity to religious paintings of this period in terms of colour and imagery should be noted. 

The subject matter suggests that the embroidery was made in Tuscany; this saint is not well known outside Italy. St Verdiana (or Viridiana) led a holy life and may have served as a model for girls in whom modesty and religiosity were encouraged. She made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (Spain) before living the rest of her life as a hermit. Many miracles are ascribed to her, and in particular her name is invoked as protection against snake bites. Note the snakes that writhe in front of her. The official cult of this saint is recorded from 1553 when she was canonised. She does however appear in religious images before that date.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The gold thread is very worn which masks the fact that it would originally have formed a very large proportion of the background, different stitches showing different features.

The picture depicts a scene from the Legend of St Verdiana (Viridiana) Attavanti, recluse and patron saint of Castlefiorentino in Tuscany, northern Italy. To the sound of bells miraculously rung, a group of people enter the saint's cell to find her kneeling dead, while her soul is borne aloft by angels; the snakes whose company she adopted for mortification lie entwined before her. The scene is set in a chamber in which the saint is kneeling at her prayers before a picture; on the walls is a floral pattern. On the left hand side, behind her a group of seven men watch her from beside a belfry, in which two bells swing. Five of the men are tonsured (a sign that they were members of the secular clergy) and the one at the front of the group wears a dalmatic which was originally silver (in or nué technique). Their gestures are of amazement and reverence: the man at the front has his hands raised, palm forward. One figure, whose head alone is visible, holds his hand to his head. Two wear capuccio or chaperons, hoods typical of early 15th-century Tuscany, and long gowns (one with matching sleeves, the other a lucco with slits through which the sleeves of a contrasting undergarment are visible). Their length is indicative of their high status, as short version of the lucco could also be worn. In the centre of the room, above the latticed window, two angels are raising the saint heavenwards.

Instead they were attached to a tape and tied around the waist as separate garments. Worn under the hoops and petticoats, they were accessed through openings in the gown and petticoat seams.
These two pieces of silk embroidery on linen represent a pair of unfinished pockets. They show that the embroidery was done first, before cutting out and sewing up. The lack of space for an opening in the embroidery indicates that these were probably intended to be the backs of a pair of pockets. This is somewhat unusual, as most pocket backs were left plain.
The abstract squiggly pattern is called ‘vermicelli’, which is Italian for ‘little worms’. This design is also found on early 18th century bedcovers and quilts, particularly worked in yellow silk. The choice of colour imitates imported Indian embroideries, which preferred the natural yellow shade of tussar silk found in Bengal. The use of backstitch can also be attributed to the influence of Indian needlework.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Although the background has now faded into a vermillion shade, it would have been on a striking red backgrouind when it had been new. 

The main centre of production of Chinese export textiles in the 16th - 17th century would have been Canton, or Macau island, (an island off the Cantonese coast where the Portuguese settled from 1557), as these were the main areas from which foreigners were allowed to trade with the Chinese, under Chinese supervision. 

While it might have been possible that Cantonese embroiderers were copying from a design provided by their clients, the icononography and the embroidery technique bear an extraordinarily heavy Portuguese influence: The double-headed pelican motif was a popular motif in Portuguese textiles from the 17th - 19th century, and the embroidery bears great resemblance to that produced in the Portuguese region of Castelo Branco, particularly in the use of flossed, untwisted silk thread and lattice gold work executed on large textile backgrounds formed of a few loomwidths of silk panels joined together.

By designing ecclesiastical hoods as highly decorative items in their own right, Pugin returned to an established medieval practice which had died out in Europe in the 16th century. 

This hood depicts Saint Thomas of Canterbury as bishop and is appropriate for the Kent church for which it was designed. The head is seen full-face, as in the manner of church brasses, a form advocated by Pugin. The embroidery is worked in the manner of <i>opus anglicanum</i> (English medieval work). This was much admired and aspired to in the mid-19th century by amateurs and an increasing number of professional church embroiderers. 

The embroidery is raised, padded and couched work. The highly professional padded techniques of silver and silver-gilt work show the skills of professional accoutrement makers such as Lonsdale & Tyler, whereas Mrs Powell may well have supplied the central, figurative roundel.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The embroidery is made on a crimson satin ground, red being the most auspicious colour for Chinese celebrations. There is also a long inscription praising the merits of Mr Huang, bearing the names of the donors in gold leaf. According to the inscription Mr Huang originates from Guangdong province, and the style of embroidery on this textile is probably from the Chaozhou region of the Guangdong province.

Although this birthday hanging was rendered in traditional convention, interestingly it was used in the first London production (1934-5) of SI Hsiung's play <i>Lady Precious Stream</i>, a modern adaptation of a Chinese opera based on a Tang Dynasty tale. 

In the 1930s in Europe a series of events demonstrated European interest in the culture of Modern China: Xu Beihong had successfully staged an exhibition of Chinese ink paintings in Paris in 1935, for example, and the Republican Chinese government organised an exhibition of Chinese Art at the Royal Academy (it was the first exhibition of Chinese arts to be held at the RA). This play was extremely well-received by the London public, and went on to run on the Broadway in New York, as a modern update on the traditional Chinese operatic form, with traditional Chinese opera translated into modern stageplay.

Painter Xu Beihong provided illustrations to the published text of the play, and Mei Lanfang designed the costumes for the play.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

A large armchair of carved walnut, stained dark brown, with theatrically scrolled fronts legs and arms,heavily raked back, the seat and back upholstered in red silk velvet with silk bell fringe (both upholstery modern).

<b>Decorative Scheme:</b>
The armchair is designed to convey maximum impact to the viewer. The seat and back taper outwards towards the front and the top of the chair, emphasising the perspective and giving an enhanced sense of its enormous scale.  The upholstery is covered in modern red silk velvet, trimmed with scalloped bell fringing along the lower edge of the back and the lower edge of the seat rail, the shape of the trimming adding a sense of movement to these otherwise straight lines.  

The front legs, arms and arms supports are carved in the form of bold scrolls, moulded in section and transversally ribbed in the centre where they scroll over. The front legs are each formed as an S-scroll, as are the arms, which rest on supports that scroll outwards at the base and meet the back on what appears to be the outer edge of the upholstery of the back, thus increasing the visual breadth of the back. From the mid-height of the front legs, subsidiary scrolls form the outer edge of the front stretcher, meeting at a central cartouche with acanthus leaves wrapping the top edge. The front legs are additionally carved with what appears to be a lashing of scrollwork, as if the ends of the side stretchers were wrapped round the front legs.  The side stretchers are simpler in execution but also show scrolls meeting at the centre in a cartouche, the carving on the side stretchers carrying over onto the side faces of the back uprights. These, and the back stretcher are simply rectangular in section and are undecorated.

<b>Structure and Materials
</b>
The armchair is constructed of walnut throughout, dark-stained in those areas that are visible. The back uprights are continuous and the front legs continue up to form the arm supports.  The stretchers and seat rails are tenoned into the back uprights and the front legs. The arms supports are tenoned up into the underside of the arms and cut with a stepped joint, and the arms are tenoned into the back uprights. The arms scroll outwards at their top end and are built out so that the tenon into the back upright is disguised and the joint appears from the front to be beyond the side frame of the back. The scroll is set forward of the back upholstery by approximately 1 cm, which allows for the fixing of the upholstery. 

Where extra elements of wood are required to accomodate the design of the carved scrolls, extra pieces have simply been glued on before carving, as in, for example, the scrolling front feets, which extend well beyond the legs, the scroll at the top of each arm, and the dpeth of carving in the upper half of the front stretcher. 

The back is heavily raked above seat height. The back uprights show strong saw marks on the back surface. The back stretcher has been replaced.  The joint behind the left side must have broken awayin the past and the new stretcher is now inset into the recess, rather than tenoned in. The top rail and the bottom rail of the back panel are shallower than the back uprights and are tenoned into them close to the front edge. 

The front and side seat rails have been extended with newer wood on their underside, making them deeper than the back rail and have also been reduced in thickness from the inside.  They are cross-veneered on the front surfaces with walnut.  This may have been done at the time of the upholstery that was on the chair in 1856 and may have been done to disguise the areas at the corner of the chair where the uprights might show through the corners, which were only joined by hook-and-eye fastenings. The back corners of the seat have been reinforced underneath with blocks, cut with serpentine curves on their inner faces. 

The surviving upholstery webbing is set in open format, with two lateral webs and three running front to back. It shows two different widths, the front lateral web being narrower than all the others but all seem to have been attached at the same time, with hand-made tacks over narrow strips of leather (probably dating from the late 17th century). All the upholstery above the webbing has been renewed (2011).  In 1968 it was believed that the surviving upholstery from 1856 was the original but, although the fringing may have survived from that date, the velvet and lining appear to be of the 19th century.  There are too many tack holes to suggest only two upholstery schemes before the current one and it is likely that the pre-1856 scheme was done in the early nineteenth century (possibly 1820-40)","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The most famous master carver at this time was Andrea Brustolon (1662 - 1732). Such chairs have often been associated with him but his work was generally much more figural. This chair was acquired in 1856 as fine example of the carver's art, although it was observed in 1881 that 'the appearance may be showy but the size is out or proportion, and the chair itself made uncomfortable for use'.

VENICE; late 17th century
This handsome late-Baroque chair is interesting because it recently still retained its original velvet cover although this was in so ragged a state that the chair could no longer be shown in that condition. The original cover has therefore been removed and preserved and the chair has been re-upholstered. The surviving fragments, together with an old photograph taken during the last century (when some of the trimmings were still in their correct position), have enabled us to re-construct the original appearance of the chair although the quality of fringe cannot be properly matched today. Nor should there be a seam round the edges of the frame of the back. An interesting feature is the cord which masks the two vertical seams of the back. These seams were originally necessary because the silk materials of the time were normally woven to a width of about 21 inches. Materials has therefore to be joined in order to cover the whole width of the back of chairs. The seam was usually made as unobtrusive as possible.  The manner in which the cords masking the seams break up the surface of this chair-back may seem strange to our eyes, but the fragments show that this was how the chair was originally finished.

A chair of this magnificence was made for show as much as for use. It would have formed part of a large suite of chairs, arranged in a stately manner around the walls of a richly decorated room. 

The vigorous Baroque carving echoes the style of Andrea Brustolon (1662–1732), a sculptor and wood carver who made furniture for many of the great palaces in Venice. But it does not include the human figures for which he was celebrated.  [01/12/2012]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

E.214-1994), attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger (1561-1636) and displayed alongside it.  Waistcoats were long-sleeved upper garments, opening down the front and fitted at the waist using inserted gores.  They were often made of linen and splendidly decorated as in this example.<br><br><b>Ownership & Use</b><br>Margaret Laton or Margaret Layton – What's in a name? When the V&A acquired the jacket and portrait of Margaret Layton in 1994, we used the version ‘Laton’ following the example set in 1933 by V&A curator Albert Kendrick. However, according to documents and monuments of the Layton family in Rawdon, Yorkshire, and the Dictionary of National Biography, the name was always spelled with a ‘y’. We are now making corrections in V&A labels, brochures, publications and on the V&A website.

In the portrait, Margaret Layton wears the waistcoat with an Italian needlelace collar and cuffs, a black velvet gown, a red silk petticoat and a whitework apron. As with many women of this period, we know very little about her life, other than her recorded connections to her father and husband.<br><br><b>Materials & Making</b><br>The waistcoat has long, tight sleeves, narrow shoulder wings, semi-circular cuffs and a small curved collar at the back neck, dating it to about 1610. Made of linen, it is hand sewn and lined with coral silk taffeta. Originally the jacket was fastened with pink silk ribbons. In the 1620s, an edging of spangled silver-gilt bobbin lace was added.  Fragments remain of the original silk ribbons used for fastening.

Panels of satin edged with lacquer imitating tortoiseshell. Panels are worked in coloured silk thread, metal purl and beads. 

On the lid, in the centre, a lady in a red dress and blue stole sits, holding a basket of fruit and a tulip, between an acorn-tree with a squirrel and a green leafy tree. She may be the personification of Taste or Smell. Below this scene is fish-pond.

On the right hand side are a castle with mica windows, a snail, a bird on a branch bearing leaves and fruit, a ladybird and a stag between two flowers. The four sides of the casket are decorated with panels of laid work in a geometrical design of flowers and fruit.

 The casket is lined with padded pink silk. Inside the lid is a mirror surrounded by a stuck-on design of narrow silver braid. Behind the mirror is a piece of marbled paper, which is also used on the exterior base of the box.

Caskets and workboxes were made and used by girls in the 17th century. The girls would decorate small panels with embroidery which would then be sent to a cabinet-maker to be made up into a box. They were often fitted with compartments for sewing and writing as well as a small mirror. Many cabinets also had secret compartments, used to store personal possessions such as jewellery or letters. The high cost of the materials, as well as the skill needed to create these boxes, means they could only have been made in wealthy households.

<b>People</b>
The panels were worked by young girls, aged around 11 or 12, as part of their education. Girls started learning needlework skills aged 6 or 7, first creating a band sampler (see T.433-1990) and then moving on to more complex pieces such as cutwork. Embroidering the panels of a casket or for a mirror (see T.17-1955) appears to have been one of the last stages of a girl’s needlework education. These skills would be useful later in life in the management of a household.

<b>Materials & Designs</b>
Biblical, mythological and classical scenes were all popular themes for decorating caskets. The top of this casket is decorated with a lady holding a basket of fruit and a tulip, possibly the personification of Taste or Smell, both of whom were popular subjects for embroidery.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Christ is offering bread to Judas (with money bag). On the table are three platters (one with lamb) and two goblets. Two hanging lights behind, with three candles each.
The embroidery has been constructed and applied as one large piece : cream satin ground is visible in some places representing the bench coverings, but most area is taken up with the heads and shirt-clad torsoes of the figures, worked in shades of coloured silks, and their voluminous cloaks covering the rest of their reclining bodies in or nue. The table, vessels and bench legs are in silver thread.
Much black silk has fallen out. Some outlines of figures are emphasized with applied black cord, which may have been added later. The underdrawing is clearly visible in areas particularly the flesh (bare feet and faces). There is much padding under the figures which emphasizes the drapery and body contours.
There is a narrow (3cm) fringe of silver and silver-gilt at the top and sides, and a deep fringe at lower edge.

It depicts the Last Supper, the gathering of Christ and his 12 disciples described in the New Testament. The embroidery dates from the period when William Laud was Archbishop of Canterbury. Laud laid great emphasis on the restoration of beauty and dignity to church decoration and worship. In the 1630s many entries in churchwardens’ accounts refer to the refurbishment of altars and pulpits and the provision of rich textiles for church furnishings. 

The embroidery is likely to have been commissioned by Henry 5th Baron Sandys of the Vyne, in Hampshire, and is associated with an altar frontal also in the Museum's collection, T.108-1963, with the Sandys arms and dated 1633. The exceptional quality and technique of the embroidery suggest that it was worked by Edmund Harrison, the King’s Embroiderer, and can be compared with the smaller picture of the Nativity in the V&A’s collection T.147-1930 signed by him. The print source for the dossal has been identified as an engraving of The Last Supper circa 1590, by Hieronymous Wierix (c.1553-1619) after Otto van Veen (1556-1629).","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

<u>Design</u>
The cabriole legs have ball feet, each gripped by four bird’s claws, which, unusually, are pierced through at the lower end. The lower part of the leg is plain, rounded, with, above, a section carved with feathers (looking in places more like leaves), the top edges meeting the seat rail with additional, scrolled spandrel brackets. A lappet is apparently laid over the feathers, the edges moulded and scrolled into the ears of the cabriole leg with the outer edges carved as ‘reversed gadrooning’. The lower scroll of these meets an acanthus pendant, carved down the front of the leg. Below this, carved swags of fabric hang from a carved ring and appear to be looped back and knotted at the back of the leg, with carved tassels hanging down, all this forming the lower edge of the feathered section. On the knee, a scallop shell is carved over crossed palms. 
The back legs, which are continuous with the uprights and square sectioned with a curving rake, are cut on the front face cut with a decided kick. The inner edges are chamfered. 
The back is rectangular with a pierced central splat. The uprights taper upwards with an ‘S’ curve just below the junction with the cresting rail. The front faces have a moulding on the outer edge and are angled back towards the splat. This faces are carved with a foliated scroll at the base and a symmetrical device of scrolls flanking a shell.
The cresting rail is serpentine with outer corner extensions, heavily scrolled back in a tight paper-like scroll. The front faces of these are carved with acanthus and a small floral drop. The centre section of the rail is raised and is likewise heavily scrolled, the front carved with a scallop shell with crossed palms below. 
The outer side section curves of the centre of the crest rail continue down, scrolling into the pierced splat, which is composed of two opposed elongated scrolls, enclosing a circle. This which contains a carved crest showing an armoured leg with spur on a torque (the crest of Eyre). Below this is a further pair of scrolls with a leafy pendant, which touches the base rail of the splat, carved with two half rounds, one each side of the leaf. The shoe, into which the splat is fitted, is of standard pattern with a moulded top edge.

<u>Construction, seat and condition:</u>
Mortise and tenon construction, the uprights and back legs continuous. The seat rails are tenoned into the back uprights and double pegged and tenoned into blocks above the front legs. The uprights are tenoned up into the top rail, the splat also tenoned up into this and down into the back seat rail. The shoe sits on top of the back rail and sits around the front three faces of the base of the splat, and the splat is pinned forwards into the shoe. The back seat rail is set with a single piece of mahogany veneer. This is broken away in places and may be a replacement.
The seat is upholstered in green silk velvet, now much faded and worn. Underneath a finejute base cloth is visible. The webbing is black and white chevron, 4.8 cm wide with 3 chevrons, with 3 widths back to front and 3 set laterally. All of these have broken through and loose horsehair is visible above. 
The seat  has rails of oak with softwood blocks attached with large handmade nails, these all late additions. The shaped spandrel block inside the proper right back leg is a replacement and the other back block is missing. There is evidence of old nails on the top inner surface of the seat rails. The spandrel blocks on the sides are lighter in colour and may be replacements.  The shaped corner block inside the back legs are late additions. 

<u>Damage</u>:
There is a fracture at the base of the splat. The front spandrel of the proper left front leg is missing.  The end of a claw on the front proper right foot and small section of claw on PL are missing.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The front sections of the collar and the left and right fronts of the waistcoat are cut from ivory silk, woven with a broad vertical satin stripe alternating with a group of twelve vertical narrow stripes. The back of the collar, shoulder pieces, underarm panels and facings are made of plain ivory silk satin. The waistcoat is lined and backed with linen and the back has three pairs of linen tapes to adjust the chest size. The waistcoat fastens with twelve small buttons covered with ivory silk satin and embroidered in polychrome silk with a flower head. The two front collar parts, front edges and hem are finished with a narrow border of black chenille edged with coloured chenille thread. This has been turned to the inside and stitched down at the centre left and right front of the collar to reduce its height.  The waistcoat has been appliquéed with circular medallions of ivory twill silk which have been painted in black with classical images derived from the first three volumes of <i> Le Antichità di Ercolano</i> (1757-1792). The medallions, which depict centaurs, satyrs and bacchantes (Maenads) dancing and making music, are suspended from embroidered floral garlands and bows and are arranged symmetrically in twelve pairs across the waistcoat fronts. A larger pair of medallions set beneath the pockets depict the Cupid Seller. Although the subjects of the medallions were drawn from wall paintings the creation of a dense black ground throws the figures into relief to create the effect of  cameos. The embroidery, which is worked over black outlines in polychrome silks and chenille, was executed after the medallions were applied. The buttonholes were cut after the waistcoat was embroidered.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Central scene depicts The Last Supper : Christ with halo at top centre, and 12 disciples reclining on benches around a table with elaborate pedestal. Christ is offering bread to Judas (with money bag). On the table are three platters (one with lamb) and two goblets. Two hanging lights behind, with three candles each.
The embroidery has been constructed and applied as one large piece : cream satin ground is visible in some places representing the bench coverings, but most area is taken up with the heads and shirt-clad torsoes of the figures, worked in shades of coloured silks, and their voluminous cloaks covering the rest of their reclining bodies in or nue. The table, vessels and bench legs are in silver thread.
Much black silk has fallen out. Some outlines of figures are emphasized with applied black cord, which may have been added later. The underdrawing is clearly visible in areas particularly the flesh (bare feet and faces). There is much padding under the figures which emphasizes the drapery and body contours.
There is a narrow (3cm) fringe of silver and silver-gilt at the top and sides, and a deep fringe at lower edge.
It has been applied to a plain woven linen backing.
There is some evidence of old water stains, particularly in the lower right quarter. The velvet is very vulnerable at bottom edge where it extends as far as the backing with no further protection. The velvet pile is worn in several places with two carefully darned short slits. There are some slits in the cream satin.
The pattern of wear at top suggests that tabs may have been attached at intervals. Also old nail holes through the velvet at top edge, concealed under the fringe.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

It depicts the Last Supper, the gathering of Christ and his 12 disciples described in the New Testament. The embroidery dates from the period when William Laud was Archbishop of Canterbury. Laud laid great emphasis on the restoration of beauty and dignity to church decoration and worship. In the 1630s many entries in churchwardens’ accounts refer to the refurbishment of altars and pulpits and the provision of rich textiles for church furnishings. 

The embroidery is likely to have been commissioned by Henry 5th Baron Sandys of the Vyne, in Hampshire, and is associated with an altar frontal also in the Museum's collection, T.108-1963, with the Sandys arms and dated 1633. The exceptional quality and technique of the embroidery suggest that it was worked by Edmund Harrison, the King’s Embroiderer, and can be compared with the smaller picture of the Nativity in the V&A’s collection T.147-1930 signed by him. The print source for the dossal has been identified as an engraving of The Last Supper circa 1590, by Hieronymous Wierix (c.1553-1619) after Otto van Veen (1556-1629).","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The embroidery is mostly in tent and cross stitch, with some details (noses, buttons, scarves etc) in padded satin, overcast and cross stitches. Predominant colours are red, pink, yellow, blue, green, cream, white, brown and black.
The border has a light brown ground decorated with large, brightly-coloured flowers - carnation, lily, convolvulus etc. The design of the flowers is consistent with the 1730s (the dating of the embroidery suggested by the use of illustrations from the 1st edition).
The two scenes which fill the centre of the cover are taken from the illustrations to Gay's Fables, first published in 1727. On the right is The Jugglers, based on William Kent's illustration for the 42nd fable (engraved by P Fourdrinier). The designer of the embroidery has slightly adapted the illustration, adding more spectators and giving the room a chequered floor of brown and white tiles (although not reversing the scene as Wace states in his article - the scene was reversed in the 6th edition of the Fables published in 1746).
On the left is The Painter who Pleased Nobody and Everybody, the 18th fable, also illustrated by William Kent and engraved by P Fourdrinier. The embroidery designer has again adapted the original illustration, adding colour by the addition of a blue and white vase of flowers in the previously empty fireplace, and of flame-stitch upholstery to the previously plain settee. The more classical elements of Kent's illustration have been replaced by contemporary equivalents - a window in place of a classical colonnade and the use of 18th century costume for the portrait figures.
The settee seat forms part of a set with six chair seats T.474 to 479-1970. Apart from slight colour variations, the same border is used for all the chair seats and the settee seat, with the addition of a spray of flowers to fill the gap between the two halves. All the chair seats, though not the settee, are embroidered with the initials E W, which indicates an amateur embroideress, which the irregularity of much of the embroidery would support.
When acquired the seat covers were each mounted and framed in 20th century walnut frames. The settee seat was unmounted in 1999 in preparation for redisplay in the British Galleries.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

As the bustle replaced the crinoline and bodices contoured the figure, corsets became longer to achieve the desired hourglass silhouette. They encased the abdomen and enveloped the hips, and the amount of whalebone also increased to give a smoother outline and help prevent wrinkling of the fabric. This corset from the 1880s is composed of twelve separate shaped pieces and forty whalebone strips.

To improve shape, performance and comfort, manufacturers claimed numerous inventions. One of the most successful was the steam-moulding process developed by Edwin Izod in 1868, and still used in the 1880s to create elegant corsets such as this one.  The procedure involved placing a corset, wet with starch, on a steam-heated copper torso form until it dried into shape. The result was a beautifully formed corset, whereby 'the fabric and bones are adapted with marvellous accuracy to every curve and undulation of the finest type of figure' (The Ladies' Gazette of Fashion advertisement, London July 1879).

This corset was worn by the donor's mother at her wedding in 1887.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/satin"

Suitably lavish textiles for domestic goods could be hard to come by. These hangings incorporate both British and Indian cottons. The import of decorated cottons from India was illegal at this time, but this did nothing to stem the demand. Both men and women negotiated directly with smugglers to acquire them. 
According to a diary kept by the donor's ancestor, these hangings were made on the Bedford School Estate in London, a large housing estate that funded a charitable school for underprivileged children. Over 6,400 pieces have been stitched together.

The coats of arms in the borders (one is embroidered and has been added over a blank shield) are those of three patrician families of Augsburg: Gossenbrot, Rehlinger and Welser.

They would have been created for a fashionable middling or aristocratic household. The original use of the word ‘chintz’ was for Indian cotton cloth on which a pattern was produced by hand-drawing and dyeing with mordants and resists. While there was immense enthusiasm for chintz among British consumers in the late seventeenth century, there were also many opponents to the imported Indian goods, including the weavers of wool, linen and silk. In a bid to protect British manufacturing, a law was passed in 1701 to forbid the import of dyed or printed cottons and silk from India into Britain, except for re-export. Despite this ban, the overwhelming fashion for these light, colourful textiles led the writer Daniel Defoe to comment that it had ‘crept into our houses; our closets and bedchambers, curtains, cushions, chairs and at last beds themselves were nothing but calicoes and Indian stuffs, and in short almost everything that used to be made of wool and silk’. 

According to a diary written by a the donor’s ancestor (Baptist Noel Turner, 1739–1826), these hangings belonged to Elizabeth and Christiana Willes, and were said to have been made for their house on the Bedford School Estate, London. The Bedford School Estate was around 13 acres (5.2 hectares) of land in the parish of St Andrew, Holborn, London. Proceeds from the estate funded the Bedford School, and were also given as alms to the poor and to aid the marriage of poor women. Although difficult to prove, such narratives suggest how the histories handed down with each intricately pieced patchwork are often as  cherished as the cottons and silks that document its textile history.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Worked in the pattern now known as 'clamshell' or 'shells'.  The hangings include two large foot curtains, two small head curtains, a lower valence in three parts and an upper valence. There is no surviving headcloth or coverlet. The fabrics are both dress and furnishing, and are decorated in a variety of techniques, including block-printing, painting, resist-dyeing, stencilling and embroidery. Each of the patches has a linen template and reverse. These individual patches are worked into a larger pattern of scalloped-edged diamonds outlined in green silk tape. The repetition of prints within each diamond is completely symmetrical. Although many of the prints appear to be similar, most have been used exclusively within one diamond, meaning that there is very little duplication.

The upper valance has 368. Each object is lined with linen and edged in a green, white and yellow silk braid. The foot curtains still have their original brass hoops and linen tapes.

The most enduring method in Britain is known as 'piecing over paper', where the pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are then tacked round each of the shapes, before being joined together from the back using overstitch. However, in this example, each of the patches has been pieced over printed or plain linen, before being individually lined with linen. This process would have been very labour-intensive. The huge number of textiles and accuracy of the stitching supports the idea that the hangings may have been worked professionally. Over 6,400 pieces have been stitched together.

In 18th century Britain, the bedrooms of the wealthy were used for the display of luxury goods. They were a place where family members rested, servants entered and guests were entertained. Ornamental patchwork hangings reflected a household's access to a range of fashionable textiles.

Suitably lavish textiles could often be hard to come by. These hangings incorporate both British and Indian cottons.

The scenes depicted on them vary between mythology and pastoral or seasonal pursuits, like skating, but are all characterised by beguiling figures in idealised landscapes, surrounded by abundant flowers. Here the central scene is of the god Bacchus reclining in a chariot being drawn by two leopards. He is holding aloft his thyrsus (staff twined with vine leaves). Bacchus and his followers are often depicted in art as representations of frenzy or debauchery, but here they are smiling and benign.

Covers made for chairs, settees and stools are among the richest sources of eighteenth century pictorial needlework. They were undertaken both by professional workshops, and by amateur needlewomen, particularly in the form of canvaswork. This was usually worked in the basic counted thread stitches of tent stitch and cross stitch, learnt by most girls as part of their needlework education. Skill at needlework was considered an accomplishment in women, who could demonstrate their expertise by embroidering decorative yet functional items such as chair seats. While most of the embroidery here is in tent stitch, the faces and hands of the figures are additionally embroidered over with a type of speckling stitch, which gives texture and allows for great subtlety in shading the flesh tones.

7, 8 Embroidered napkins
Turkey
1830–70

Embroidery was a popular form of decoration in the Ottoman home. Items such as napkins were embroidered with great quantities of colourful silk and metal thread in inventive designs. Images of ornate houses and gardens (the ideal Ottoman home) were fashionable in the 19th century.

These napkins are embroidered with various stitches including <i>muşabak</i>, meaning ‘netted’, a type of openwork found only on Ottoman embroidery. This can be seen most clearly in the green walls of the buildings in the napkin on the left.

The centre shows a decorative initial 'B' is worked in ivory silk cord with green decoration. There are two curving stems emanating from the letter with shamrock leaves.  These are embroidered in green silk and edged in gold silk gimp.

The seamed maroon silk velvet ground is embroidered in gold coloured silk cord around the edge which is finished in gold-coloured silk gimp. The embroidery is a simple laid satin stitch which is worked through the velvet and a backing of linen. The gimp which edges the embroidery is laid and couched. There is evidence of paper on the back of the linen and the ivory embroidery of the initial is embroidered through the paper backing.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The central scene is of a hunting party. A lady is seated in the centre holding a long-barrelled gun, with dead game at her feet. To either side are two gentlemen standing, one gesturing to his left, the other blowing a hunting horn, with a white dog at his feet. While most of the embroidery is in tent stitch, the faces and hands of the figures are additionally embroidered over with a type of speckling stitch, which gives texture and allows for great subtlety in shading the flesh tones. There is a deep surround of intertwining flowers, mostly stylized large blooms, on a brown ground. These and the central scene are worked in a range of colours originally vibrant, whose brightness is retained on the reverse.

The embroidery has been pulled into a parallelogram shape by the embroidery stitches. It retains its bare canvas edges, which show no signs of the seat having been used. The canvas has selvedges at top and bottom, and is hemmed at each side. On the canvas edges to the left and right of the worked seat are areas of trial embroidery stitches carried out in pink black and yellow wool.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

"http://data.silknow.org/object/6eb108e4-b10e-39dc-9b6c-ef8bfd2e01c2","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","This important embroidered motif was originally attached to curtain pelmets (or lambrequins) made for the Red Drawing Room and Saloon at Chirk Castle, near Ruabon, North Wales.  The house was decorated by A.W.N. Pugin for Colonel Robert Myddelton Biddulph from 1845 and the furnishings were, almost certainly, supplied by J.G. Crace of Wigmore Street, London.  

This item is one of two examples acquired by the Museum (see T.267:2-2004), both are rare and important being from a small group of surviving embroidered decorations from an important Pugin interior decorative scheme.  Few of Pugin's domestic textile designs have survived .  No other domestic embroideries are known apart from the group sold by Christie's from Chirk Castle, of which this is one.  

Pugin's curtain designs for this scheme correspond to his pattern for 'Ancient Curtain Hangings' illustrated in his 'True Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture' (1841).  The roundels were sold attached to curtains and pelmets.  These were removed by Michael Whitway who purchased them at the sale, believing the curtains were replacements.

The motif is also important in providing additional technical information on mid nineteenth century professional embroidery, especially that completed for particular household furnishers.  Pugin's embroidered designs for church vestments are well known and the Museum has an important range of the vestments made for his own church in Ramsgate.  In this case the work was produced for the Crace firm.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This has a central decorative bar with decorative finials including three shamrock leaves.  

The seamed maroon silk velvet ground is embroidered in gold coloured silk cord which is edged in gold-coloured silk gimp.  The embroidery is a simple laid satin stitch which is worked through the velvet and a backing of linen.  The gimp which edges the embroidery is laid and couched.

This mitre with its lappets (the hanging tails) are made of a luxurious white silk enriched with gold thread, showing the scrolling foliage and flowers typical of the Gothic revival style of designer A. W. N. Pugin. It is part of a set of church furnishings designed by Pugin for use in St Augustine’s Church, built on the grounds of his own house in Ramsgate, Kent.

The mitre shows embroidery of a very high standard. Pugin’s ecclesiastical work was organised by John Hardman & Co., the Birmingham ecclesiastical suppliers, with whom he is closely associated. Pugin’s embroidery was carried out in Hardman’s own embroidery workshops, run by Mrs Powell, John Hardman’s sister and the wife of his partner, and by Lonsdale & Tyler of Covent Garden, who produced all forms of uniform and regalia work. Mrs Powell set up her business in 1842 to deal with the increasing interest in vestments and church decoration arising from Pugin’s work. She also employed another Birmingham firm run by Lucy and Winifred Brown, whom she took into partnership in 1852. The very high professional standard of embroidery and goldwork in this example suggests it was worked by Lonsdale & Tyler.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The house was decorated by A.W.N. Pugin for Colonel Robert Myddelton Biddulph from 1845 and the furnishings were, almost certainly, supplied by J.G. Crace of Wigmore Street, London.  

This item is one of two examples acquired by the Museum (see T.267:1-2004), both are rare and important being from a small group of surviving embroidered decorations from an important Pugin interior decorative scheme.  Few of Pugin's domestic textile designs have survived .  No other domestic embroideries are known apart from the group sold by Christie's from Chirk Castle, of which this is one. 

Pugin's curtain designs for this scheme correspond to his pattern for 'Ancient Curtain Hangings' illustrated in his 'True Principles of Pointed or Christian Architecture' (1841).  The roundels were sold attached to curtains and pelmets.  These were removed by Michael Whitway who purchased them at the sale, believing the curtains were replacements.

The motif is also important in providing additional technical information on mid 19th century professional embroidery, especially that completed for particular household furnishers.  Pugin's embroidered designs for church vestments are well known and the Museum has an important range of the vestments made for his own church in Ramsgate.  In this case the work was produced for the Crace firm.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

One part of the design is usually matte, the other shiny. The design appears in reverse on the opposite side. Damask evolved in China, and was imported to Europe, where Italian silk weavers adopted the technique, sometimes incorporating Eastern design elements into their own textiles.

The majority of Italian 14th century textiles fall into the category of ""pomegranate patterns"" – a term coined in the nineteenth century. There are many variants on the theme of the ""pomegranate"", such as the patterns that incorporate the design. Often, the ""pomegranate"" resembles more closely a pinecone, a thistle, a lotus flower, or a pineapple. Pomegranate patterns are seen most frequently in the period c. 1420 to 1550. They seem to dominate textile production to such a degree that non-""pomegranate"" designs tend to be overshadowed. Even in this example, where the pomegranate design is not the dominant element, it is still present. The main element of the pattern is a multi-foil shape containing a clump of flowers. This motif has been cut in half by the selvedge, and would have been matched to the corresponding side of the design when sewn together for use. An example of this can be seen in 1339-1864.

Bronzino's portrait of Eleanor of Toledo, painted in the early 16th century, shows how a half-motif in such fabric would have been used by itself. Her sleeves are made up from long rectangles of a large-motif figured velvet. The motif is cut precisely down the middle by the edge of the fabric, the selvedge is then covered by a border of trimming. This method of cutting the pattern pieces straight maximised economy in the use of fabric. In the early 15th century Devonshire Tapestries (T.202 to 205-1957), courtly figures are depicted lifesize, wearing sumptuous garments with large-scale patterns and motifs. Many of these are in monochrome textiles, and while the patterns are rather bolder and simpler than the example here, they show damask type designs.

While this fabric has an ecclesiastical provenance, it is a type of fabric that would have been worn for secular dress as well. Several books on 14th and 15th century dress provide evidence of richly dressed figures portrayed in fabrics almost exclusively based upon leaves, flowers, and the ""pomegranate"" design. It is quite difficult to find depictions of patterns that are not dominated by ""pomegranate"" motifs, but the central figure in ""A Female Saint with a Donor and Two Women"", by the Master of the Baroncelli Portraits, c.1490, shows a similar type of damask to this one in her dress.

Often these textiles were made of silk.

In the ikat technique, yarns are tie-dyed according to the design before they are woven into cloth. Ikat fabrics with striking chevron (V-shaped) patterns were popular in the Muslim courts of the Deccan plateau in south India. The added strips of gilded silver contribute to this fabric's elegant appearance for courtly use.

The arrowhead pattern is one of the simplest, but most effective, of ikat designs, and is created by resist-dyeing the warp threads and then manipulating them after they have been set up on the loom but before they are woven. This type of pattern is often seen on a type of fabric called <i>mashru</i>, which is a silk and cotton mixture with a satin weave. This is a more luxurious fabric than <i>mashru</i>, however, as it uses all silk and no cotton, with additional strips of pure gold woven into the cloth.

It was usually made of rich materials (silks) and adorned with orphrey bands, embroidered with images of particular symbolic significance in Christianity. Different colours were used for different seasons in the Christian calendar, black being appropriate for funerals or requiem masses. This chasuble was recycled from a pall, a cloth used to cover a coffin. The embroidery dates to the early 16th century, while the style of the vestment dates to after 1600. The initials RJ on the back are those of the person for whose coffin the cloth was originally made (Robert Thornton, Abbot of Jervaulx).

Riding habits were one of the few women’s garments available in a tailored style. Gradually demand grew for stylish, practical and hard-wearing outfits suitable for a wide range of outdoor activities including shopping, travelling and walking. By the 1870s the tailored look for women had really begun to take hold. Cutting systems used on men’s suits were transferred to fashionable skirts and bodices and the resulting styles were rapidly adopted. Fashion magazines and cutting journals trumpeted the superior skill of the tailor whose methods of manipulating cloth captured the full beauty of the female form.

This bodice shows how the tailor has modified his techniques to suit the fashionable silhouette. With special attention to measuring, cutting and making he has moulded the cloth to follow the curves of the bust, hollow of the waist and the prominence of the hips.  The outer cloth was fitted to the figure with the aid of a canvas interlining constructed with darts and seams to give the required contours. Both were skilfully pressed into shape using a variety of irons and a damp rag which was necessary to produce steam.

It was probably part of a valance that hung round the top or base of a regal bed or the platform on which a monarch or dignitary sat when officiating at a ceremony. It was probably made in Portugal where, as in most of Europe, trade organisations called guilds ruled the production of professional embroidery. 

Craftsmen served an apprenticeship in order to become masters and set up their own workshop. Lisbon had only about ten skilled masters in the 16th century. The guild regulations reveal that trainee embroiderers had to learn how to prepare different materials and motifs. The simplest task was the making of coats of arms in gold and silks, and the most difficult were the embroidering of the human figure and face and the use of different qualities of gold thread. The embroidered motifs on this piece fall between the extremes. 

As a result of Portugal's voyages of discovery from the 15th century onwards, the Portuguese came into contact with designs from different cultures, including China and India.This piece combines Chinese features with the grotesque style, derived from the decorations discovered in the excavations of ancient Roman wall decorations in Rome in the late 15th century.

The wide neckline and short sleeves of the dress are typical of fashionable evening wear of the mid 1820s. Although it retains remnants of the high-waisted, neo-classical shape popular at the beginning of the century, its construction shows the move towards the lower waists and fuller skirts of the 1850s. The use of velvet demonstrates the trend for more sumptuous fabrics after the dominance of cotton and muslin in the previous two decades.

The death of Princess Charlotte, the only child of George IV, in childbirth in 1817 plunged the whole country into mourning and set the high standards for mourning dress of this period. Fabrics such as silk and velvet were too shiny to be worn for the first stages of mourning, however, official mourning guidelines issued by the Lord Chamberlain decreed that black velvets and silks were permissible in the third and final stage.  This dress would have been worn with an evening turban, long gloves and a pelisse cloak, often lined with chinchilla fur. It is likely that it was a gift from William Jardine and was worn when mourning the death of Jane Johnstone's grandmother, Elizabeth Johnstone who died in 1825.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

In Spain it became established in the 16th century in place of the amice (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p.142). The five wounds gushing blood, embroidered on this collar, represent the Five Wounds of Christ, or the stigmata. These wounds were the marks from his crucifixion - one to each hand and each foot where he was nailed to the cross, and one on his right side where he was pierced with a lance. They drew attention to the suffering he experienced on behalf of mankind. It was probably made in a professional embroidery workshop or in a convent where nuns engaged in the making of ecclesiastical vestments.

Collars such as this one are often depicted in paintings of St Lawrence who died before becoming fully ordained as a Catholic priest; the combination of dalmatic and collar indicate his status as a deacon. Such depictions show that the collar fitted high around the neck of the wearer, curving round the neck so that the maximum height was at the back; the rounded front edges tied together by means of cords attached at each end and completed by a large tassle. Often the imagery or decoration on the collar echoed that of the panels on the front, back and sleeves of the dalmatic, although in miniature because of its size. Good examples appear in two paintings of St Lawrence by Francisco de Zurbaran, the first (1636) is a front view in The Hermitage, St Petersburg and the second (1638-9) is a side view in the Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes, Cadiz. The depth of colour of the dalmatic in the first of these paintings suggests it may represent quite closely the original ensemble which this collar would have complemented. Both are illustrated in Jonathan Brown. <i>Zurbaràn</i>. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1991, pp.24 & 100.

During the Counter-reformation in the second half of the sixteenth century and thereafter, the expression of intense emotion was expressed through a variety of religious artefacts, from painting and sculpture to ecclesiastical vestments. The Council of Trent (1545-63) revitalised religious art in order to arouse religious fervour. The imagery on vestments was therefore part of a wider movement in the plastic arts. For example, in Spain, the great power at the forefront of the Counter-reformation and the likely source of this collar, the Holy Week processions which immediately preceded Easter used sculpture of Christ crucified and taken down from the cross to excite emotion in the ordinary people who lined the streets. For much of the year, these sculptures were kept in their own chapels within churches, where they could be venerated. In such pieces, the agony of Crucifixion was evident because the wounds were so realistically depicted on carefully carved representations of human bodies with horrendous gashes of red wounds. The wounds on this collar are an evocative shorthand of this vivid three-dimensional imagery and would have been easily understood by a largely illiterate popular audience. (See for example some of the work of the Castilian sculptor Gregorio Fernandez in Juan Jose Martìn Gonzalez. <i>Escultura Barroca Castellana</i>.

Jackal hunting was popular among British soldiers and administrators living in India during the nineteenth century. The rules were based on the British fox hunt although the hunting packs tended to be made up of dogs of different breeds known as ‘Bobbery-Packs’ in Anglo-Indian colloquial terms, and hence the name ‘Bobbery Hunt’.

This light linen coat would have proved ideal for hot climates, replacing the heavy woollen cloth used for British hunts. It was probably worn by the huntsman who looked after the dogs, as the slanting pocket on the front could have held a hunting whistle or horn. The collar is very similar to one worn by the Earl of Darlington for a Yorkshire hunt in 1826: ‘Lady Arabella was attired in her scarlet habit, and his Lordship in a straight-cut scarlet coat, with an embroidered fox on the collar, a hat, and a leather girdle across his shoulder. His two whippers-in were also in hats, and had the embroidered fox on the collar.’","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The earliest surviving guild regulations are available for Lisbon and date to 1517. Lisbon, the largest city in Portugal and its capital, only had a small number of skilled masters in the sixteenth century: in 1551 about 10, in 1552 about 16 working in eight workshops, and in 1620 about 11. The guild regulations reveal the different levels of examination that led to mastery of the trade, embroiderers having to learn how to prepare different materials and motifs. The simplest task was the making of 'a coat of arms in gold and silks with some kind of motif appropriate to arms', and the most difficult the embroidering of the human figure, in particular, the features of the face, and the use of different qualities of gold thread.  The embroidered motifs on this piece fall between these two extremes of complexity. (Teresa Alarcao & José Alberto Seabra Carvalho, <i>Imagens em Paramentos Bordados. Seculos XIV a XVI</i>. Instituto Português de Museus, 1993, p. 19-20).

No contract for this type of Portuguese embroidery has been found, so the costs of producing such work and the negotiation between client and craftsman are not known.

As a result of Portugal's voyages of discovery from the 15th century onwards, the Portuguese came into contact with designs from different cultures, including China and India. Such taste impacted on Portuguese textiles. The V&A collection has a small but impressive group of Sino-Portuguese and Indo-Portuguese style embroideries (about 120), which date from the 16th to 18th centuries; most are made in multi-coloured silks on cream or white satin grounds, rather than in the rich materials used here. Indeed only three pieces, all from circa 1550-1600 are embroidered velvet. This piece is unusual in combining Chinese and grotesque (Roman) styles, and at the time of its purchase was deemed typical of a particular strain in Portuguese decorative arts.

It should be noted however that Spain also made major voyages of discovery in this period and it is likely that this taste entered the vocabulary of its decorative arts about the same time.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

It is made of red silk velvet, to which has been applied a white satin oval embroidered in brown and red, applied yellow and blue satin scrolling foliage. Yellow cording outlines the appliqué motifs. The collar has a pale pinkish yellow fringe and has lost the cords that were usually attached to the front in order to tie it in place. It was probably made in a professional embroidery workshop or in a convent by nuns. The embroidered Five Wounds of Christ, or stigmata, represent the marks from his crucifixion – one to each hand and foot where he was nailed to the cross, and one on his right side where he was pierced with a lance. 

During the Counter-Reformation from the second half of the 16th century, the Catholic Church encouraged the revitalisation of the arts and in particular their role in arousing intense emotion. In Spain, the country at the forefront of the Counter-Reformation, the Holy Week processions which preceded Easter used a sculpture of Christ crucified and taken down from the cross. The agony of Crucifixion was evident because the wounds were so realistically depicted. The embroidered wounds on this collar are an evocative shorthand for this vivid three-dimensional imagery. A largely illiterate popular audience would have easily understood the reference.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

This chasuble is the vestment worn by a Catholic priest when celebrating the Mass. It was - and is - worn over the alb and stole. This style of chasuble became widespread after 1600. Prior to that - at the time from which this embroidery dates - chasubles were circular garments which slipped on over the head.

Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. This fact usually accounts for the dominant imagery being on the back and the construction being more perfect there. This chasuble is probably made from Italian (or Spanish) velvet, cut down from its original bell shape into the fiddle-shape that became popular in the early seventeenth century. The colour suggests this chasuble would have been worn for requiem masses or for Easter. 

The velvet was probably made in Italy or Spain, then the major velvet weaving centres in Europe, and provided an ideal foil for rich embroidery which might be executed at home or abroad.

From the mid-fourteenth century onwards, velvet weavers belonged to a separate guild from other weavers, and kept their weaving methods closely guarded secrets from their competitors. The weavers' skills and techniques were revered and coveted, and so highly prized that the most specialised of velvet weavers were not permitted to leave their city's walls without permission. If a velvet weaver did take his skills to a rival city, he could expect not just the confiscation of all his assets but to be sentenced to death.

Weaving velvet was an expensive process, requiring three times the amount of silk of that used in other fabrics. The guild dictated that the weaver use the very finest of silk threads- organzine. The textile could then be made more costly still with the addition of silver and gold thread. 

The soft texture and comparatively small pattern of this velvet, combined with its light weight, suggest that it would have been used for clothing. Velvets were well suited to noble dress, not merely because their costliness demanded a certain level of income but because they draped well and enhanced the silhouette of the wearer. This velvet is a good example of the repetitive symmetrical pattern (consisting of a floral motif enclosed in ogee curves) developed and put to wide use during the fifteenth century, which continues to be employed in velvet weaves today.

Often embroidered with brightly coloured wools and silks, valances provided a means of decorative insulation from the draughts, cold and humidity that could plague sixteenth-century houses. 

Beds and their textiles figure prominently in inventories of effects from the Renaissance, an indication of how greatly they were valued. Individuals of high rank conveyed their position to their contemporaries through conspicuous consumption, with a lavish display of costly textiles.

This valance is worked entirely in tent stitch, a term that is derived from the French word 'tendre', meaning to stretch or extend. This was a reference to the stretching of the canvas on which the embroidery would be worked. French embroiderers, however, employed a different term for the stitch, calling it <i>petit point</i>, or 'little stitch'. 

The lively scene depicted here is that of the mythological union of Mars and Venus in the Garden of Love. Mars has laid his weapons aside and is kneeling in supplication to Venus, an act that symbolised Love vanquishing Aggression.

Three female figures in french court dress are positioned on the right: one of them is seated, one standing and one rising from a seated position with her arm outstretched, pointing to the standing female and kneeling male figures who are the focal point of the scene. Three men dressed as warriors are positioned on the left; they wear cuirasses and plumed helmets. The male figure farthest to the left carries a white banner; the man in the centre stands sentry-like holding a shield and a spear; and the last and most elaborately dressed figure is kneeling on the ground, his sword and shield cast aside. 

The subject of the valance is Mars (Roman God of War) and Venus (Roman Goddess of Love) in the Garden of Love. In this scene, Mars has laid his weapons aside and is kneeling in supplication to Venus, with both deities flanked on either side by their attendants. This symbolic act represents Love vanquishing Aggression. Venus, clearly delighting in her triumph, turns towards her attendants, casting an imperious backward glance at her suitor. As if to reinforce further the humbling of the God of War, a nearby squirrel mimics Mars's pose. This scene of courtship takes place in palace grounds with an abundance of flowers, trees and shrubbery, against a backdrop of an architectural landscape, through which flows a river. Animals are interspersed throughout the landscape, including a dove, a pigeon, a squirrel, rabbits, swans and snails.

This embroidered panel would have belonged to a set of three valances, their purpose to adorn the head of a bed, obscuring the pole and rungs of the bed curtains. Embroidered with brightly coloured wools and silks, valances provided a means of decorative insulation from the draughts, cold and humidity that plagued sixteenth-century houses. 

Beds and their textiles figure prominently in inventories of effects from the Renaissance, an indication of how greatly they were valued. Those individuals who were of high rank, conveyed their position to their contemporaries through conspicuous consumption, with a lavish display of costly textiles.

<i>Embroidery</i> 
The valance is embroidered entirely in petit-point, the French name for tent stitch (also known as half stitch), which enjoyed a period of great popularity in the last few decades of the sixteenth century. Despite being a relatively simple stitch, which enabled the embroiderer to cover large areas of ground comparatively quickly, petit-point nevertheless aspired to the same elevated status as tapestry and was distinguished from other stitches by its classification as needlework tapestry (<i>la tapisserie à l'aiguille</i>). By virtue of its simplicity, petit point was practised by amateur and professional embroiderer alike. The stitch lent itself well to naturalistic motifs and bold, albeit somewhat geometric compositions. This valance would most likely have been worked by a woman of noble birth; embroidery was held to be an essential skill for any accomplished woman of aristocratic rank. However, due to the size and complexity of the composition, the possiblility remains that it may have been executed by a professional embroiderer, who may have been employed as part of the household. 

<i>Subject</i> 
The Garden of Love, identifiable here by the prominent fountain of Cupid, shown with his quiver, raising a single arrow in the air, was a common parable in the Renaissance ornamental repertoire, characterised by its idyllic landscape and the languid couples who people it. The garden served not just as a suitable and decorative site for courtship, but as a visual metaphor for love itself. This was a device frequently employed in the decoration of Italian furniture, most commonly employed for objects commissioned as wedding gifts. Thus, allegorical depictions of love on valances such as this one, reinforced to the viewer both the role and status of the bed and the part it played in the conjugal relations that were pivotal to the continuation of a family's lineage. The enduring theme of love vanquishing aggression, as depicted on this valance, was a subject entirely suitable to the the context of the bedroom.

It is made of red silk velvet, to which has been applied a white satin oval embroidered in brown and red, applied yellow and blue satin scrolling foliage. Yellow cording outlines the appliqué motifs. The collar has a pale pinkish yellow fringe and has lost the cords that were usually attached to the front in order to tie it in place. It was probably made in a professional embroidery workshop or in a convent by nuns. The embroidered Five Wounds of Christ, or stigmata, represent the marks from his crucifixion – one to each hand and foot where he was nailed to the cross, and one on his right side where he was pierced with a lance. 

During the Counter-Reformation from the second half of the 16th century, the Catholic Church encouraged the revitalisation of the arts and in particular their role in arousing intense emotion. In Spain, the country at the forefront of the Counter-Reformation, the Holy Week processions which preceded Easter used a sculpture of Christ crucified and taken down from the cross. The agony of Crucifixion was evident because the wounds were so realistically depicted. The embroidered wounds on this collar are an evocative shorthand for this vivid three-dimensional imagery. A largely illiterate popular audience would have easily understood the reference.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The corporal is a square white linen cloth,  upon which the Sacred Host and chalice are placed during the celebration of Mass and it is important that it is protected from dirt or contamination.The spots of wax on the surface of this piece underline the need to cover up the corporal itself.

In Roman form the burse is ordinarily made of two pieces of cardboard about twenty-five centimetres (or ten inches) square, bound together at three edges, leaving the fourth open to receive the corporal. One outer side of the burse is of the same material and colour as the vestments with which it is used; the rest is lined with linen or silk. The use of the burse dates from the 12th century. When the corporal reached small dimensions, it was carried to the altar, sometimes in the missal, sometimes in a special receptacle, a box or bag, which finally took the present form of burse. Just when this custom began cannot be determined. <i>Chronicon vetus rerum Moguntinarum</i> (1140-1251) mentions a precious corporal-case; this may have been, however, only a box for the continual safe-keeping of the corporal. St. Charles Borromeo describes a <i>sacculus corporali</i> distinct from the case in which corporals were preserved (<i>Acta Mediolan</i>, 1683, I, 524). From the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries the use of the burse spread, and in 1692 it was universally illicit to celebrate Mass without one (<i>Decreta S.R.C</i>, 1866, ad 2m).","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

By the 12th century mitres were usually made in white linen or silk, and often had figurative scenes showing saints. They gradually became decorative rather than figurative, so that by the Renaissance their patterns were often quite secular in appearance. In this case the embroidered images are positively secular, the only reference to the Christian faith being the hands holding palm branches in the centre of the decoration. The palm branch was the symbol of the triumph of faith over the suffering of martyrdom.

This mitre is thought to be Italian. It reputedly belonged to Cardinal Matteo Palmieri, Archbishop of Acerenza and Matera from 1518 until 1538. As befitted a man of his high rank and precocious abilities (he was elected Archbishop at the age of 25, under a special dispensation, as the canonical age was 27), the magnificent embroidery on the mitre is a true feat of virtuosity. The grotesque-style designs have been worked in silk embroidery threads, using a clever combination of long, short, satin and chain stitches, combined with different colours to create naturalistic shading. Such skilled needlework would no doubt have been executed in a professional workshop or convent.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Jackal hunting was popular among British soldiers and administrators living in India during the nineteenth century. The rules were based on the British fox hunt although the hunting packs tended to be made up of dogs of different breeds known as ‘Bobbery-Packs’ in Anglo-Indian colloquial terms, and hence the name ‘Bobbery Hunt’.

This light linen coat would have proved ideal for hot climates, replacing the heavy woollen cloth used for British hunts. It was probably worn by the huntsman who looked after the dogs, as the slanting pocket on the front could have held a hunting whistle or horn. The collar is very similar to one worn by the Earl of Darlington for a Yorkshire hunt in 1826: ‘Lady Arabella was attired in her scarlet habit, and his Lordship in a straight-cut scarlet coat, with an embroidered fox on the collar, a hat, and a leather girdle across his shoulder.

The earliest surviving guild regulations are available for Lisbon and date to 1517. Lisbon, the largest city in Portugal and its capital, only had a small number of skilled masters in the sixteenth century: in 1551 about 10, in 1552 about 16 working in eight workshops, and in 1620 about 11. The guild regulations reveal the different levels of examination that led to mastery of the trade, embroiderers having to learn how to prepare different materials and motifs. The simplest task was the making of 'a coat of arms in gold and silks with some kind of motif appropriate to arms', and the most difficult the embroidering of the human figure, in particular, the features of the face, and the use of different qualities of gold thread.  The embroidered motifs on this piece fall between these two extremes of complexity. (Teresa Alarcao & José Alberto Seabra Carvalho, <i>Imagens em Paramentos Bordados. Seculos XIV a XVI</i>. Instituto Português de Museus, 1993, p. 19-20).

No contract for this type of Portuguese embroidery has been found, so the costs of producing such work and the negotiation between client and craftsman are not known.

As a result of Portugal's voyages of discovery from the 15th century onwards, the Portuguese came into contact with designs from different cultures, including China and India. Such taste impacted on Portuguese textiles. The V&A collection has a small but impressive group of Sino-Portuguese and Indo-Portuguese style embroideries (about 120), which date from the 16th to 18th centuries; most are made in multi-coloured silks on cream or white satin grounds, rather than in the rich materials used here. Indeed only three pieces, all from circa 1550-1600 are embroidered velvet. This piece is unusual in combining Chinese and grotesque (Roman) styles, and at the time of its purchase was deemed typical of a particular strain in Portuguese decorative arts.

It should be noted however that Spain also made major voyages of discovery in this period and it is likely that this taste entered the vocabulary of its decorative arts about the same time.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Usually, those on the body of the garment were attached between the waist and the hemline, those on the sleeves towards the edge with the imagery clearly visible when the arm was at rest by the wearer's side. (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p.142). The other panels in the collection that arrived with this panel and match it in design, seem to be two for the body of a dalmatic and two for the sleeves.  They would probably have been attached to a garment of some variety of black silk (possibly velvet). Our own collection has a sixteenth century funerary dalmatic intact, with its panels in the correct position (T.766.1919).

The creation of embroidery and the learning of embroidery skills followed a similar path to that of sculpture and painting, and recently serious research has begun on its professional development in certain local centres in Spain (e.g. Marta Laguardia's work on Salamanca). Basically, skills were learnt through apprenticeship in a guild and groups of objects were made according to similar specifications (e.g. the workshop of the sculptor Gregorio Fernandez or that of the painter Francisco Zurbaran). Successful execution of standard imagery was valued (where today 'creativity' and 'originality' are highly prized). In some cases, embroidery was learnt in convents and nuns were skilled needlewomen who could make church ornaments.

By the seventeenth century the stark imagery of skull and crossbones was well-established shorthand for the fragility of human life, the transitory nature of the flesh, being used on gravestones and monuments as well as in painting and textiles. The raw drama of this imagery fits in with the principle of arousing deep emotion in the viewer, a principle promulgated in the Council of Trent (1545-63) and adopted in countries that espoused Counter-Reformation ideology. In many ways the imagery and its attention to the fragility of human life echoes the 'vanitas' paintings of the seventeenth century, such as the works by Juan Valdés Leal, <i>In Ictu Oculi</i> and <i>Finis Gloriae Mundi</i> in the Iglesia del Hospital de la Santa Caridad in Seville. (<i>Juan de Valdés Leal (1622-1690)</i>. Cordoba: Caja Sur Publicaciones, 2001, pp. 48-9)

Maria Dolores Vila (Museo Nacional de Artes Decorativas, Madrid) indicates that there are magnificent examples at the Monasteries at El Escorial and Guadalupe in Spain, but almost all convents or small parishes had some such items, and great houses had them with their coats of arms added (Personal communication by email, 30 May 2006). She noted the publication of certain objects in <i>Las Edades del Hombre: el arbol de la vida</i>. Catedral de Segovia, May-November 2003, pp.391-392, 275-78; <i>Huellas</i>. Catedral de Murcia, 2002, p. 340. Similar emphasis on skeletons, crosses, etc. is found in embroideries on chasubles etc. Johnstone illustrates a particularly dramatic chasuble made in Augsburg before 1630, and a dalmatic made in the Northern Netherlands in the second quarter of the seventeenth century. Its apparels follow the Netherlandish rather than Spanish fashion (Johnstone, p.96.)","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This chasuble is the vestment worn by a Catholic priest when celebrating the Mass. It was - and is - worn over the alb and stole. This style of chasuble became widespread after 1600. Prior to that - at the time from which this embroidery dates - chasubles were circular garments which slipped on over the head.

Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. This fact usually accounts for the dominant imagery being on the back and the construction being more perfect there. This chasuble is probably made from Italian (or Spanish) velvet, cut down from its original bell shape into the fiddle-shape that became popular in the early seventeenth century. The colour suggests this chasuble would have been worn for requiem masses or for Easter. 

The velvet was probably made in Italy or Spain, then the major velvet weaving centres in Europe, and provided an ideal foil for rich embroidery which might be executed at home or abroad.

(Johnstone, pp. 16-17). Mitres were established headgear for bishops by the eleventh century, and were also worn by the Pope (Bishop of Rome) and high-ranking abbots. By the 12th century they were usually made in white linen or silk, and often had figurative scenes showing saints. They gradually became decorative rather than figurative, so that by the Renaissance their patterns were often quite secular in appearance. In this case the embroidered images are positively secular, the only reference to Christian iconography being the hands holding palm branches in the centre of the decoration. The palm branch was the symbol of the triumph of faith over the suffering of martyrdom.

The style of embroidery fits within Renaissance developments, with references to grotesque ornament which spread in the early sixteenth century from Italy (Johnstone, p. 79). The term grotesque refers to the location of the designs, the grottos, which inspired the style, rather than to the subjects themselves. The most important of these, discovered in 1493, were parts of the celebrated Domus Aurea, the Golden House of Nero (ruled AD 54–68), in Rome. Designs of masks, draperies, vases and other motifs were found painted on walls and ceilings.

It is likely that such skilled needlework was executed in a professional workshop or in a convent. Embroidery workshops existed in large towns by the Renaissance, governed by guild rules over the training of apprentices, the preparation of embroidery materials and the execution of the needlework. In convents, nuns often exercised their needles in the service of the church by making vestments, as well as teaching girls the requisite skills of a well-brought up woman: embroidery, reading and writing (e.g. Giovanni di Pagolo Morelli in <i>Ricordi</i> (begun in 1393), cited in Mary Rogers & Paola Tinagli. <i>Women in Italy, 1350-1650. Ideals and Realities</i>. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2005, p. 107.

Reputedly, at one time, this mitre was in the possession of Bishop Palmieri who had been born on  August 10, 1493 in Naples, where he subsequently became a cleric. He was elected archbishop of Acerenza and Matera, after his uncle Vincenzo Palmieri resigned in his favour on July 30, 1518. A special dispensation was required as he had not yet reached the canonical age of 27. He became a cardinal in the consistory of November 21, 1527, receiving his cardinal's red hat and the charge of S. Clemente in November 1527. He resigned the government of his see in favour of his brother nine months later.  He was administrator of the see of Sarno between May 1529 until August 1530, administrator of the see of Lucera between August 1534 and February 1535, and he participated in the conclave of 1534. In June 1535 he became administrator of the see of Conza, for a year, and subsequently administrator of the see of Policastro from July 1535 until his death in January 1537. Named by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V governor of Milan right before his death, he died on January 20, 1537 in Rome and was buried in the church of S. Maria del Popolo, Rome.

It was usually made of rich materials (silks) and adorned with orphrey bands, embroidered with images of particular symbolic significance in Christianity. Different colours were used for different seasons in the Christian calendar, black being appropriate for funerals or requiem masses. This chasuble was recycled from a pall, a cloth used to cover a coffin. The embroidery dates to the early 16th century, while the style of the vestment dates to after 1600. The initials RJ on the back are those of the person for whose coffin the cloth was originally made (Robert Thornton, Abbot of Jervaulx).

It was probably part of a valance that hung round the top or base of a regal bed or the platform on which a monarch or dignitary sat when officiating at a ceremony. It was probably made in Portugal where, as in most of Europe, trade organisations called guilds ruled the production of professional embroidery. 

Craftsmen served an apprenticeship in order to become masters and set up their own workshop. Lisbon had only about ten skilled masters in the 16th century. The guild regulations reveal that trainee embroiderers had to learn how to prepare different materials and motifs. The simplest task was the making of coats of arms in gold and silks, and the most difficult were the embroidering of the human figure and face and the use of different qualities of gold thread. The embroidered motifs on this piece fall between the extremes. 

As a result of Portugal's voyages of discovery from the 15th century onwards, the Portuguese came into contact with designs from different cultures, including China and India.This piece combines Chinese features with the grotesque style, derived from the decorations discovered in the excavations of ancient Roman wall decorations in Rome in the late 15th century.

In Spain it became established in the 16th century in place of the amice (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p.142). The five wounds gushing blood, embroidered on this collar, represent the Five Wounds of Christ, or the stigmata. These wounds were the marks from his crucifixion - one to each hand and each foot where he was nailed to the cross, and one on his right side where he was pierced with a lance. They drew attention to the suffering he experienced on behalf of mankind. It was probably made in a professional embroidery workshop or in a convent where nuns engaged in the making of ecclesiastical vestments.

Collars such as this one are often depicted in paintings of St Lawrence who died before becoming fully ordained as a Catholic priest; the combination of dalmatic and collar indicate his status as a deacon. Such depictions show that the collar fitted high around the neck of the wearer, curving round the neck so that the maximum height was at the back; the rounded front edges tied together by means of cords attached at each end and completed by a large tassle. Often the imagery or decoration on the collar echoed that of the panels on the front, back and sleeves of the dalmatic, although in miniature because of its size. Good examples appear in two paintings of St Lawrence by Francisco de Zurbaran, the first (1636) is a front view in The Hermitage, St Petersburg and the second (1638-9) is a side view in the Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes, Cadiz. The depth of colour of the dalmatic in the first of these paintings suggests it may represent quite closely the original ensemble which this collar would have complemented. Both are illustrated in Jonathan Brown. <i>Zurbaràn</i>. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1991, pp.24 & 100.

During the Counter-reformation in the second half of the sixteenth century and thereafter, the expression of intense emotion was expressed through a variety of religious artefacts, from painting and sculpture to ecclesiastical vestments. The Council of Trent (1545-63) revitalised religious art in order to arouse religious fervour. The imagery on vestments was therefore part of a wider movement in the plastic arts. For example, in Spain, the great power at the forefront of the Counter-reformation and the likely source of this collar, the Holy Week processions which immediately preceded Easter used sculpture of Christ crucified and taken down from the cross to excite emotion in the ordinary people who lined the streets. For much of the year, these sculptures were kept in their own chapels within churches, where they could be venerated. In such pieces, the agony of Crucifixion was evident because the wounds were so realistically depicted on carefully carved representations of human bodies with horrendous gashes of red wounds. The wounds on this collar are an evocative shorthand of this vivid three-dimensional imagery and would have been easily understood by a largely illiterate popular audience. (See for example some of the work of the Castilian sculptor Gregorio Fernandez in Juan Jose Martìn Gonzalez. <i>Escultura Barroca Castellana</i>.

The ground weave is a damask of the type known as <i>rinzu</i>. It is a 5-end warp faced satin weave figured with a 5-end weft-faced satin weave.

At the end of the 18th century the small industry flourished, adapting to changes in fashion by producing more plain fabrics and silk kerchiefs. Weavers often trained in Lyon, and Swedish silk weavers imitated French designs. The Napoleonic wars brought in a period of decline in the industry, when many mills closed.

Jean Pierre Mazer was active in Stockholm between 1796 and about 1820, and his sons continued the family business into the 19th century.

In Spain it became established in the 16th century in place of the amice (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p.142). This collar has lost the cords ending in impressive tassels that were usually attached to the front in order to tie it in place. The five wounds gushing blood, embroidered on this collar, represent the Five Wounds of Christ, or the stigmata. These wounds were the marks from his crucifixion - one to each hand and each foot where he was nailed to the cross, and one on his right side where he was pierced with a lance. They drew attention to the suffering he experienced on behalf of mankind. It was probably made in a professional embroidery workshop or in a convent where nuns engaged in the making of ecclesiastical vestments.

Collars such as this one are often depicted in paintings of St Lawrence who died before becoming fully ordained as a Catholic priest; the combination of dalmatic and collar indicate his status as a deacon. Such depictions show that the collar fitted high around the neck of the wearer, curving round the neck so that the maximum height was at the back; the rounded front edges tied together by means of cords attached at each end and completed by a large tassle. Often the imagery or decoration on the collar echoed that of the panels on the front, back and sleeves of the dalmatic, although in miniature because of its size. Good examples appear in two paintings of St Lawrence by Francisco de Zurbaran, the first (1636) is a front view in The Hermitage, St Petersburg and the second (1638-9) is a side view in the Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes, Cadiz. The depth of colour of the dalmatic in the first of these paintings suggests it may represent quite closely the original ensemble which this collar would have complemented. Both are illustrated in Jonathan Brown. <i>Zurbaràn</i>. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1991, pp.24 & 100.

During the Counter-reformation in the second half of the sixteenth century and thereafter, the expression of intense emotion was expressed through a variety of religious artefacts, from painting and sculpture to ecclesiastical vestments. The Council of Trent (1545-63) revitalised religious art in order to arouse religious fervour. The imagery on vestments was therefore part of a wider movement in the plastic arts. For example, in Spain, the great power at the forefront of the Counter-reformation and the likely source of this collar, the Holy Week processions which immediately preceded Easter used sculpture of Christ crucified and taken down from the cross to excite emotion in the ordinary people who lined the streets. For much of the year, these sculptures were kept in their own chapels within churches, where they could be venerated. In such pieces, the agony of Crucifixion was evident because the wounds were so realistically depicted on carefully carved representations of human bodies with horrendous gashes of red wounds. The wounds on this collar are an evocative shorthand of this vivid three-dimensional imagery and would have been easily understood by a largely illiterate popular audience. (See for example some of the work of the Castilian sculptor Gregorio Fernandez in Juan Jose Martìn Gonzalez. <i>Escultura Barroca Castellana</i>.

A vertical opening with a scalloped flap runs parallel to the length of the sleeve and intersects the cuff. 

The lack of any decoration except a brown velvet collar reinforces the coat’s informality. Its grey-brown shade suggests that it might be the colour known in the 18th century as ‘drab’.

There is a layer of stiffening (paper?) between the appliqué and the velvet base. Round each applied satin motif there is sewn fine yellow silk cording. The collar as a whole is trimmed round the edge with a pinkish yellow silk fringe and lined with glazed blue linen, which is tacked on to the front with red running stitches, visible on both sides. The linen is worn with patches of the original natural colour showing through the blue dye. On the back there are signs that cords for tying the collar in place were once attached (by blue thread), as the tension exerted during tying has created circular worn patches. The cords are no longer attached. The red velvet reveals few signs of deterioration, while the creamish satin is cracked both horizontally and vertically and in certain instances has been repaired.  

The Five Wounds are embroidered in two colours suggestive of fresh and drying blood. They are positioned to indicate the wounded parts of Christ's body when he was taken from the cross: the wounds inflicted by the nailing of his hands and feet and the lance wound in his side. This last is the central motif, depicted as a slash. From each wound blood spurts.

There is a small handwritten paper label sewn to the back of the vestment, indicative of its origins. Rectangular in shape, it bears text in pencil and black and red ink. In pencil in the right hand corner, scored out in black ink: 30/-; in black ink below the price and scored out in the same ink: No. 102; in black ink below that: Spanish collar of a Dalmatic; in red ink in bottom right hand corner, the V&A accession number.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The whole design appears to have been drawn directly onto the canvas using black ink, providing a clear guide to the embroiderer. The panel has, in addition to the areas worked, coloured threads put in loosely as colour coding in the clothing of the figures, who are depicted in an approximation of Turkish dress. 
		
The mixture of Chinese and Turkish ornament is typical of the random juxtaposition of such elements in European decorative art in the early 18th century, but may have been particularly influenced by the arrival at the French court in 1721 of the first ambassador from the Ottoman Empire to be received there, and the consequent enthusiasm in France for what was perceived as Turkish style. Turquerie began to appear not only in fashion, interiors and painting but also entered the realms of literature, theatre and opera. Both of the figures here have a pale complexion, suggesting they are perhaps Europeans in fancy dress, although the clothing of the female figure is based on the 17th century French artist Henri Bonnart's print <i>La Grande Sultane.</i>

The amalgamation of real and mythical animals suggests a portrayal of a fantastical foreign land, which is amplified by the fanciful use of scale and unusual details:
In the upper-left of the panel is an inaccurate, or ‘fantastical’, depiction of a flying bird with a tail of three peacock feathers. The winged dragon, or serpent, in the centre of the design has been depicted with only two legs to walk upon and the lion in the bottom-right corner appears to be the size of a small dog when compared to this and the surrounding foliage. What appear to be three lambs or sheep (with undocked tails) are shown lying to the left of the design, watched over by a collared dog of a smaller size. If viewed as being sheep, this grouping is suggestive of pastoral scenes, which were also fashionable at the time. However, the lack of detail available could allow them to also be interpretted as a group of mythical, scaled, dog-like creatures.

The tree in the centre of the design is similar to a date palm, but the simple outlines and varying scaling of the other plants and flowers prevent identification –it is probable that many of them are simply aesthetically pleasing approximations or imagined creations.

Pinholes are visible along the vertical selvages of the canvas panel, most likely as a result of it being attached to a frame to be worked on. The embroidery has been worked in tent stitch which is one of the most basic yet versatile stitches in canvas work embroidery. The intended purpose or method of display for the completed embroidery is unknown but the size of the panel suggests that it could have been mounted as decoration for a fire screen.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/f79c1b4d-2599-3a17-b42f-b6b3014fbbcc","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","It is difficult to determine what the original use of this panel and its matching partner (119-1880) were. While the shape and construction are entirely in keeping with that of the panels on Spanish style dalmatics, the pattern of holes down the side of the piece suggest it may have been used as upholstery. Spanish chairs of the 16th century had backs and seats of a similar size to this panel (unlike Italian chairs which had rather narrower backs, as a rule). The pattern of darning suggests friction on the lower edge of the panel, and would be in keeping with wear and tear inflicted by a seated body. The grotesque style of pattern is not unknown on dalmatic accessories, as there are collars in our collection which have such motifs, however, it is strange that there is no obvious reference in the imagery to the Church or its saints.

As an apparel panel, the object belonged to a set of church ornaments and probably fulfilled the function of a panel on a dalmatic (the priestly garment worn by deacons). The Spanish style of dalmatic had matching apparels on the front, back and sleeves, those on the body being substantially larger (squarer) than those on the sleeves (rectangles). Usually, those on the body of the garment were attached between the waist and the hemline, those on the sleeves towards the edge with the imagery clearly visible when the arm was at rest by the wearer's side. (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p.142). A second panel in this collection matches this one, and would have adorned the other side of the skirt.

If used for religious purposes, this panel is significant as an example of the pre Council of Trent (1545-63) design on church ornaments. While the Council's impact on sculpture and painting is well covered in existing literature on the plastic arts, its interpretation in textiles has largely remained hidden within specialist textile histories. 

The creation of embroidery and the learning of embroidery skills followed a similar path to that of sculpture and painting, and recently serious research has begun on its professional development in certain local centres in Spain (e.g. Marta Laguardia's work on Salamanca). Basically, skills were learnt through apprenticeship in a guild and groups of objects were made according to similar specifications (e.g. the workshop of the sculptor Gregorio Fernandez or that of the painter Francisco Zurbaran). Successful execution of standard imagery was valued (where today 'creativity' and 'originality' are highly prized). In some cases, embroidery was learnt in convents and nuns were skilled needlewomen who could make church ornaments.

A number of sixteenth and seventeenth century dalmatic collars and apparels survive in the V&A collection, divorced from their original garment (about 64). It seems likely that panels from dalmatics may have survived intact longer than other parts of the dalmatic which may have become damaged during church services or been recycled at a later date. In addition, collectors in later centuries tended to be more interested in patterned textiles or textiles with particularly painterly imagery rather than the plain silks or silks with repeating patterns that were used for the basic body of vestments.

As a furnishing, it could have been used either in the sixteenth century or as part of a 19th century revival of such styles of furniture. It is particularly rich in terms of its visual impact and its metallic threads, and would therefore be most suitable for royal furnishings (a chair such as that on which Mary Tudor sits in the Eworth portrait of about 1550, thought to have been painted for her betrothal to Philip II of Spain). Sixteenth or seventeenth-century dalmatic apparels have been used as upholstery on a simple chair of the type that was popular as a historical revival in the late nineteenth century, now in the Lehman collection. The seat backs demonstrate a desire for the opulent, decorative qualities of the embroidery rather than its iconographical content, as the design has been applied on its side rather than so that it is 'readable'.

Family history associates it with a visit to the house by Charles II. It passed by inheritance to Elizabeth Smart, who married John Loxley in the 19th century. 

The embroidery on the casket is in exceptionally fine condition. The casket has come to the museum with its wooden protective case, lined with marbled paper, and a pink silk slip cover, made to protect the delicate surfaces of the embroidery. Together these have helped to preserve it from damage and the fading of its fresh colours.

The panels of the casket would have been worked by a young girl, of about the age of 11 or 12, as the culmination of her needlework education, which would have begun with samplers, and the decoration of small objects like pin cushions. She would embroider a series of small panels drawn or printed with pictorial scenes, which would then be sent to a cabinet maker to be made up into a casket, the edges bound with braid. The caskets were fitted with a variety of drawers and compartments, suitable for keeping jewellery, writing equipment and letters, needlework tools, tiny toys or keepsakes. They often had one or two secret drawers, for their young owners' most precious or private possessions; this casket has five, concealed with considerable ingenuity.

Biblical scenes were the most common choice for this type of embroidery, and this example has episodes from the story of Tobias and the Archangel Raphael round some of its sides, with Rebecca and Elizir on the lid. Rebecca may be an Old Testament heroine, but the young girl who embroidered her image here has brought her right up to date, dressing her in the high heels, lace collar and elaborate ringlets of a Stuart lady.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

He speculates that this silk, woven in pairs of Bacchantes, may have been intended for cutting up to provide single figures for chair uphostery and other decorations. A chair seat and back at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and a wall hanging at the Cleveland Museum of Art, Ohio seem to have been made in this way.

Around 1800 a new wave of interest in the excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii, both in the Kingdom of Naples which fell into French hands, led to the thorough recording and some restoring of the sites. In 1800 the new interest was expressed in the redecorated dining room at Malmaison, the country house of Josephine, Napoleon's wife. It was decorated with full-sized dancing figures, the size of the original ancient paintings. In 1828 Friedrich von Gartner built a complete Pompeian house at Aschaffenburg for Ludwig I of Bavaria. 

The quality of these silks suggests they may have been made in Lyon, France, the main centre of silk weaving in this period, sponsored from 1802 onwards by Napoleon.

These hangings seem to date from the Napoleonic period. Five pieces of the silk have been joined together to recreate a figured friez of the type found at Herculaneum. Some of the yellow silk background has a woven pattern of a garland of flowers with a ribbon in an octagonal frame flanked by griffins; the flowers do not fit into the Pompeian style and were conceled by the Bacchante silk, but the griffins appear suitably classical and were incorporated into the design of the new hangings. Palmettees and scrolls, foliage and other emblems were embroidered on to the completed hangings.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

In Spain it became established in the 16th century in place of the amice (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p.142). This collar has lost the cords ending in impressive tassels that were usually attached to the front in order to tie it in place. The five wounds gushing blood, embroidered on this collar, represent the Five Wounds of Christ, or the stigmata. These wounds were the marks from his crucifixion - one to each hand and each foot where he was nailed to the cross, and one on his right side where he was pierced with a lance. They drew attention to the suffering he experienced on behalf of mankind. It was probably made in a professional embroidery workshop or in a convent where nuns engaged in the making of ecclesiastical vestments.

Collars such as this one are often depicted in paintings of St Lawrence who died before becoming fully ordained as a Catholic priest; the combination of dalmatic and collar indicate his status as a deacon. Such depictions show that the collar fitted high around the neck of the wearer, curving round the neck so that the maximum height was at the back; the rounded front edges tied together by means of cords attached at each end and completed by a large tassle. Often the imagery or decoration on the collar echoed that of the panels on the front, back and sleeves of the dalmatic, although in miniature because of its size. Good examples appear in two paintings of St Lawrence by Francisco de Zurbaran, the first (1636) is a front view in The Hermitage, St Petersburg and the second (1638-9) is a side view in the Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes, Cadiz. The depth of colour of the dalmatic in the first of these paintings suggests it may represent quite closely the original ensemble which this collar would have complemented. Both are illustrated in Jonathan Brown. <i>Zurbaràn</i>. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1991, pp.24 & 100.

During the Counter-reformation in the second half of the sixteenth century and thereafter, the expression of intense emotion was expressed through a variety of religious artefacts, from painting and sculpture to ecclesiastical vestments. The Council of Trent (1545-63) revitalised religious art in order to arouse religious fervour. The imagery on vestments was therefore part of a wider movement in the plastic arts. For example, in Spain, the great power at the forefront of the Counter-reformation and the likely source of this collar, the Holy Week processions which immediately preceded Easter used sculpture of Christ crucified and taken down from the cross to excite emotion in the ordinary people who lined the streets. For much of the year, these sculptures were kept in their own chapels within churches, where they could be venerated. In such pieces, the agony of Crucifixion was evident because the wounds were so realistically depicted on carefully carved representations of human bodies with horrendous gashes of red wounds. The wounds on this collar are an evocative shorthand of this vivid three-dimensional imagery and would have been easily understood by a largely illiterate popular audience.

This frieze is made up of figures cut from the same silk as that designed by Jean-Demosthène Dugourc and woven by the Lyonnais manufacturer Camille Pernon for the ballroom in the Casita del Labrador at Aranjuez in 1797. The satin was woven with a design of four different rows of figures; in each row comprised two figures of the same design across the width of the textile. The black ground is a 1 and 8 satin. The length of the repeat was approximately 2.2 metres, the width of the fabric 55 cm (a typical Lyonnais silk width). 

A full uncut length of the textile exists in the Musée des Tissus in Lyon, Inv. no. 24804/1. In the Sala de la Torre, Casita del Principe in el Escorial two pieces of upholstered furniture have applied motifs from the same design - the first, a firescreen has three of the figures sewn side by side (i.e. half widths seamed together), applied with embroidery, and the second, a chair has a single figure sewn on its back. In each case embroidery has been used to apply the motifs to a ground of another silk. In the first case, embroidered motifs artfully take the eye away from the seams, as they do in the V&A example. There is also a chair-seat and back at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and a wall-hanging at the Cleveland Museum of Art, Cleveland, Ohio that are put together the in the same way (See <i>Soieries de Lyon. Commandes Royales au XVIIIe S. (1730-1800)</i>, cat.no. 81, p. 130, cat. nos. 75 and 76; <i>Art and Design in Europe and America 1800-1900</i>. V&A, 1989, pp. 24-5).

The figures, <i>Bacchantes</i> were copied from engravings of wall-paintings at Herculaneum reproduced in the volume of <i>Le Antichità di Ercolano esposte</i> published in 1757 in Naples. The whole work was published in a small, limited edition by Charles III of Spain and of the Two Sicilies between 1755 and 1792, and became widely available in about 1770. At the turn of the century, there was a new wave of interest in the excavations, when the Naples fell into French hands, and Josephine decorated the dining room at Malmaison with full-sized dancing figures.

It shows the Five Wounds of Christ, or the stigmata.  These wounds were the marks from his crucifixion — one to each hand and foot where he was nailed to the cross, and one on his right side where he was pierced with a lance.  They drew attention to the suffering he experienced on behalf of mankind.

During the Counter-Reformation from the second half of the 16th century, the Catholic Church encouraged the revitalisation of the arts and in particular their role in arousing intense emotion.  In Spain, the country at the forefront of the Counter-Reformation, the Holy Week processions which preceded Easter used a sculpture of Christ crucified and taken down from the cross to produce public fervour among the faithful.  The embroidered wounds on this collar are an evocative shorthand for this vivid three-dimensional imagery.

A valance was a kind of pelmet round the top or base of the type of bed that had curtains drawn around it. The image is embroidered in coloured silk threads on a red satin ground.

The framed subject is from the story of Pyramus and Thisbe, which was told by Ovid in Book Four of the <i>Metamorphoses</i>. It is the tragic story of two young lovers whose romance was forbidden by their parents. It shows the body of Pyramus who, thinking that Thisbe was dead, committed suicide by falling on his sword. The figures holding the framed picture are dressed in stylised Roman military dress. The decorative motifs include a laughing mask, birds, a vase and draperies and are in the grotesque style, which derived from paintings on the walls and ceilings of grottos in Rome from the early Christian era. Italian artists introduced the grotesque style into France where engravers adopted it immediately, disseminating it in printed books. During the period 1550 to 1575 it was the height of fashion. 

It is possible that this panel may have been part of a set made for Queen Catherine de Medici (1519–89), or for some other member of the French court, because in the 19th century it was bound in an album inscribed ‘RICAMI DEI MEDICI’ (‘embroideries of the Medici’).","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

In the middle (central back of collar when worn) is the cream-coloured oval panel on which the Five Wounds of Christ are embroidered in fawn and red silk; the oval is surrounded by a yellow appliqué frame which leads the eye towards the stylised appliqué leaves in yellow and blue satin on either side of this central motif. There is a layer of stiffening (paper?) between the appliqué and the velvet base. Round each applied satin motif there is sewn fine yellow silk cording. The collar as a whole is trimmed round the edge with a pinkish yellow silk fringe and lined with glazed blue linen, which is tacked on to the front with red running stitches, visible on both sides. The linen is worn with patches of the original natural colour showing through the blue dye. On the back there are signs that cords for tying the collar in place were once attached (by blue thread), as the tension exerted during tying has created circular worn patches. The cords are no longer attached. The red velvet reveals few signs of deterioration, while the creamish satin is cracked both horizontally and vertically and in certain instances has been repaired.  

The Five Wounds are embroidered in two colours suggestive of fresh and drying blood. They are positioned to indicate the wounded parts of Christ's body when he was taken from the cross: the wounds inflicted by the nailing of his hands and feet and the lance wound in his side. This last is the central motif, depicted as a slash. From each wound blood spurts.

There is a small handwritten paper label sewn to the back of the vestment, indicative of its origins. Rectangular in shape, it bears text in pencil and black and red ink. In pencil in the right hand corner, scored out in black ink: 30/-; in black ink below the price and scored out in the same ink: No. 102; in black ink below that: Spanish collar of a Dalmatic; in red ink in bottom right hand corner, the V&A accession number.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

On this white ground is a larger design of linked blue hexagons, chrysanthemums and plum blossoms in faded red, blue and yellow pigments and dyes, and grey-mauve and gold embroidery.
The ground weave is a damask of the type known as <i>rinzu</i>. It is a 5-end warp faced satin weave figured with a 5-end weft-faced satin weave. The hexagons and chrysanthemums are resist-dyed with clusters of spots known as <i>kanoko shibori</i>. At least some of these effects may have been produced by the use of stencils. Additional colour has been brushed over some of the chrysanthemums.
The centres of the hexagons and chrysanthemums are embroidered with gold couched thread and some of the plum flowers are entirely worked in this method. The other plum flowers are worked in satin stitch embroidery in grey-mauve floss silk, and green floss silk is used for rudimentary branches.
The garment is lined throughout with thin red plain weave silk and the cuffs are lined with white damask self-patterned with bird roundels against a diaper of crossing wavy lines. There is a small red silk wadded hem.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Some are French silks, named, priced and numbered with their widths. Some may be English samples, usually large loom-widths.

Some of the swatches have fallen out at some date and been stuck back on the wrong page (as comparison of textile and inscription reveals). Some swatches have had bits cut out of them. Some swatches date to later than the original date of the book, and are probably of English manufacture.

Textile 77v: a crimson and yellow woven silk with formal stylised foliage, disposed in three motifs. A major scrolling, oval one, a vertical stripe of stems, and a smaller medallion type repeating motif in the ground.

Textile f. 57: The heading for this sample is found on a different page (f.67v.) of the book because the sample has been moved at some point. It reads: 'Taff [etas] 11/24 fond ruby clair brochez soye et cordonnet nue de 18 # 10 s de G.G. no.873'. The initials refer to the silk manufacturing partnership L. Galy, Gallien et cie.

Textile f. 55v: f. 67. Shot silk in lavendar blue and pink, brocaded with lace meanders in white intertwined with flowers in white, red and greens, and bouquets of mixed flowers in yellows, pinks and reds. A scrap of paper is stuck to the corner with the number 999. The inscription at the top of the page does not correspond to the textile which must have fallen out at some point and been stuck back in the wrong place.

Its bold pattern and distinctive colouring date it to a fairly brief period around 1700 when such a combination was highly fashionable. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries the increasing import trade and other contacts between Asia and Europe greatly influenced the design of fashionable silks such as this. As well as the textiles themselves in clear, bright colours, other goods such as porcelain and lacquer lent shapes and motifs to the silk designer's repertoire.

Decoration and trimmings reflected a nostalgia for the costume of the past, seen in stomacher-shaped bodices and 'vandyked' (zig-zag shaped) collars inspired by portraits from the seventeenth century.

This dress may well have been a wedding dress as it is so rich in detail and trimmings. White weddings were becoming widespread as a result of the fashion for muslin dresses.

By the thirteenth century clerical attire was more or less stabilized throughout the Latin Christian church. According to the <i>Rationale for the Divine Offices</i> of the canonist and liturgist William Durandus (d. 1296), all ranks of the higher clergy were entitled to wear the cope (or <i>pluviale</i>) for processional occasions on feast days. As a result, inventories of monastic churches testify to the existence of a very large number of copes, Canterbury, for example, owning no fewer than sixty copes in 1315. (Dyan Elliot, 'Dressing and Undressing the Clergy',  in E. Jane Burns ed. <i>Medieval Fabrications. Dress, Textiles, Cloth, and Other Cultural Imaginings</i>. London, 2004, pp. 56-58; Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds, 2002, p. 11.)

The cope had developed from the same Roman garment (<i>paenula</i>) as had the chasuble, but by the eleventh century had a different form: it was semi-circular and open down the front; the front opening fastened just below the neck across the chest with a short strip of embroidered material or a morse (a metal clasp); orphrey bands ran the full length of the front opening and on the back, the cope retained a vestigial hood which was triangular or shield-shaped (as in this example). (Johnstone, op.cit.) The cope was so voluminous that its rich materials lent themselves to recycling for other purposes. There are many surviving examples of chasubles and dalmatics made of this kind of silk velvet, but fewer examples of full copes, some of which may have been cut down into other less voluminous vestments. Christa Mayer-Thurman illustrates and describes similar velvet copes or pieces of cope in different liturgical colours (green, purple, blue and red) in <i>European Textiles. The Robert Lehman Collection</i>, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2001, pp. 74-87; Donald King illustrates and describes part of a red velvet cope from Italy or Spain in <i>European Textiles in the Keir Collection 400BC to 1800AD</i>, London, 1990, cat. 49, p. 76.

<i>Iconography</i>. 
The saints depicted in the orphrey bands probably connect the cope to a Cologne church, or at least a church nearby - and their identity is reinforced by the lettering below their image and attributes. Two of them, St Ursula and St Severinus were Cologne saints. Severinus was not very popular elsewhere. St Hubert seems to have been the dedicatee of a military order established by the Archbishops-Elector of Cologne and was frequently represented in the Cologne area. See Conversion and Mass of St Hubert panels in National Gallery (Glyn Davies). The composition of the Death of the Virgin on the hood is likely to relate closely to imagery in paintings of the period. The depiction of the figures suggests that the scene is based on the Apocryphal Gospel, in particular the passage narrating the moment of the Virgin's death, surrounded by eleven of the Apostles (according to that source, St. Thomas was preaching in remote countries and did not return in time). Here there are, however, twelve apostles, John being the youngest and represented as such, beardless. The symbols that are difficult to make out in the embroidery, because of wear, are probably the palm, All Souls Book, censer and candles.

<i>Textile</i>. Silk velvets of this type were woven in centres in Italy and Spain during the fifteenth and sixteenth century. They were often called 'ferronerie' velvets because the effect created is similar to that of ironwork. They ranked among the most expensive luxury textiles of the time.

Dye analysis, carried out at the Institut Royal du Patrimoine Artistique in Brussels in 2007 by Inge Vanden Berghe, identified the red dyestuffs as insect red and tannin (gallnuts), with a trace of red wood. Her conclusion was that the red velvet was dyed with precious red insect dyes: Polish cochineal alone, or a combination of the very expensive kermes with Armenian cochineal. All three dyes sources were in use in Europe in the fifteenth century. According to the study done by Hofenk de Graaf on red dye sources used between 1450  and 1600 (based on TLC analysis), Polish cochineal was often found in Italian silks, whereas often Armenian cochineal or kermes were detected in red fifteenth century silks with a Spanish origin. She also notes that the use of gallnut for silk weighting, in the case of a later dyeing of light colours as scarlet and crimson shades, was most likely in fifteenth century Spain. (Judith H. Hofenk de Graaff. <i>The Colourful past: origins, chemistry and identification of natural dyesfuffs</i>. Abegg-Stiftung and Archetype publications ltd., 2004, esp. pp. 62 and 68).

<i>Embroidery</i> 
The way in which the haloes are worked in a succession of curving rays is evidently characteristic of German embroidery (Johnstone, p. 75), and may be compared with the piece from the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich illustrated in her book as Fig. 86, and with the Bohemian chasuble bought from Bock by this museum in the following year (1375-1864). The application of metal threads in a diaper pattern in the ground is also similar.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

Cara Rogers later became Lady Fairhaven - she was a 'Dollar Princess', one of several heiresses who came to Britain in the late 19th century, and married into the British aristocracy bringing much-needed glamour and financial capital.

Lady Fairhaven kept several spectacular outfits bought in Paris and New York for her sister and herself in the 1880s and 1890s. These surviving garments give us an insight into the sisters' taste, and the range of dressmakers they patronised. Many of these dressmakers emulated the work of the House of Worth, which produced the most luxurious gowns created from bold French silks, combined with ingenious design touches in embroidery, lace and chiffon. The contrasting black and ivory textiles of this ensemble create a dramatic effect, while this is softened by the delicacy of the lace, and the rows of narrow ribbons encased in chiffon.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

To maintain a fire all day demands a certain level of skill - knowing when to add more fuel, when to poke the fire and when to leave it alone - and a range of specialist tools.  Bellows like these were designed to add oxygen to a smouldering fire, encouraging it to burn more fiercely.

The opulent decoration of these bellows is achieved using boulle marquetry, named after its most famous proponent, André Charles Boulle (1642–1732), cabinet-maker to Louis XIV of France, although these bellows were almost certainly made in France between 1860 and 1880. The technique of boulle involves cutting patterns out of a sandwich of layers of brass or pewter and layers of turtle shell, to create both a dark motif with a light background and a light motif with a dark background. The contrast created by using metal and turtle shell is heightened by staining the shell or, as in this case, backing it with a coloured foil (here red). Detail was added to both the metal and the turtle shell by engraving, which was often filled with black or white mastic (though this has rarely survived centuries of wear and polish). These bellows have the same design on both sides, but while the front has a tortoiseshell background with brass motifs, the back has a brass background with tortoiseshell motifs.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The velvet is of the type usually described as <i>ferronerie</i>, because the pomegranate pattern is delineated by a fine outline thought to imitate ironwork. Four full widths of velvet and two three-quarter widths make up the garment, the two central widths are intact, the other panels reveal how carefully this costly textile was used as the outer edges that form the circle have been pieced together from a number of small pieces. A deep fringe is attached round the semi-circular side - probably a later addition although such fringes were used in the Middle Ages. The whole of the cope is lined with deep blue linen (in excellent condition) - also pieced together.

<i>The orphrey bands</i> are embroidered with images of saints (see below), in coloured silks (blue, green, red and brown) and gold thread (Cologne work); there is evidence that originally sequins were sewn on to the blue background embroidery: a few sequins have survived on images of St Lucy and St Severinus, and the reddish thread that attached them to these and other parts of the embroidery is visible against the blue in all cases. The faces of the saints are stitched in white, but the features seem to have been drawn on below the surface (possibly a similar technique to that used as in Butler Bowdon cope). There is also evidence of restoration work executed in white thread, couched down, especially on the right hand side (when worn). A fine yellow braid/ribbon is sewn over the edges of the ophreys on both sides. It dates to either the late 19th or early 20th century.

<i>The hood</i> is of couched gold thread, with figures representing the Death of the Virgin Mary and is very worn. The draperies were originally of gold threads, whipped round with fine coloured silks; the heads of the various figures are of canvas embroidered with fine silks in long and short stitches. A narrow red and white fringe is sewn around the hood. It is lined with blue linen, a shade lighter than the lining of the rest of the cope.

<i>Iconography</i>.  The figures depicted on the orphreys are saints who each inhabit a similar space, placed below a castellated wall, under a decorative Gothic arch, they stand on a tesselated floor; below the floor, in Latin, is the inscription bearing the appropriate name. When the cope was on the clergyman's body, the saints faced each other across the opening: from bottom to top, St John the Baptist faced St Hubert, St Ursula faced St Lucy, St Severinus faced St Bernadino and Saint Elizabeth faced St Mary Magdalene. The textiles worn by the saints (as long flowing robes) echo the pattern found on the velvet of the cope - large, abstract pomegranate designs. Each saint carries the appropriate indicator of status and attribute: the bishops Severinus and Hubert wear mitres and carry croziers, those of royal lineage, Ursula and Elizabeth (of Hungary) wear crowns, the martyrs, Ursula and Lucy carry palm fronds. Mary Magdalen is depicted with long flowing tresses, holding a vase of ointment; Elizabeth holding a garment (no doubt an allusion to those she made for those in need). 

The hood shows the death of the Virgin. She lies in a rectilinear bed in a room with a window on the left hand side above the bed. Round the bed are twelve male figures with haloes round their heads. Eleven are bald and bearded, the twelfth is clean-shaven and has a full head of hair. He is holding a jar (?). He and two other saints in the group are behind the bed, looking towards the Virgin; one of them holds a palm branch. To their right is another group whose attention is focussed on an object that looks like an incense burner. In front of the bed side two saints looking at a book, and to their right is another saint with a book who looks as if he is reading to the assembled crowd.  Only the faces, hands and hair of the saints is executed in silk (much worn); the rest of the embroidery (draperies, bed, background) is in different metal threads (the Virgin's robes, sheet and pillow, probably in silver-gilt; the saints'/apostles' garments, bed, bedcover, background) in gold. The metal threads are couched down, the background using a red silk, and creating a geometric diaper pattern. The ground is badly worn, so much of the brownish linen base textile is visible. The haloes are worked in a succession of curving rays, which shows up the gold to great advantage. A shield has been applied centre bottom of the hood; it is divided in half, the left blue with two silver cylinders, the right red with a gold band at the top and two gold chevrons over the red. Round the edge of the hood is a half-inch band of brick stitch embroidery in metal thread, and attached round the outer edge of that band is a narrow braid in red and white (half-inch), ending in a fringe.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The main centres of silk weaving in 14th- and 15th-century Europe were in Italian cities — Venice, Milan, Lucca, Florence, Genoa, Bologna — although some centres in eastern and southern Spain attempted to compete.

The chasuble is an example of the richly decorated vestments commissioned for use in the Church. This particular example is typical of the International Gothic style favoured in the fifteenth centuries, the silk velvet characterised by scrolling motifs consistent with a dating of the late fifteenth century. Such a silk was suitable for both secular and ecclesiastical use, and might have been made in an Italian or Spanish centre (the most developed in Europe at this time). At that period chasubles were conical in shape, rather than fiddle- or violin-shaped, so this garment must have been altered at a later date (after the beginning of the seventeenth century). The silk may even have begun its life as a different form of dress or furnishing altogether, no major distinction between secular and ecclesiastical designs being made at that time. The orphreys may well date to earlier in the century, their composition and treatment being similar to Italian paintings of the 1420-50 period. The dimensions of the compartments of the orphreys may be useful eventually in identifying the geographical location of making (when guild regulations become easily accessible for different cities). Currently, identification can only be speculative, based on the aesthetics of the images. It is possible that these orphrey bands were originally intended/used for a cope. The embroidery was probably executed either in a professional workshop (urban or church) or by nuns. Certain similarities with the needlework image of St Verdiana (Viridiana) (4216-1857) in terms of composition and architectural setting are very evident; it is thought to be Florentine.

<i>Iconography of orphreys</i> 
The Life of the Virgin is told in the embroidered panels on the orphreys in eight vignettes, including the Annunciation and Assumption. Rogers and Tinagli note that from as early as the 2nd century, Mary's virtues of humility, obedience, modesty and silence were extolled in contrast to Eve's negative characteristics, and that in the early fifteenth century such ideas were communicated to a wider audience visually via Fra Angelico's Annunciation scenes, and verbally by preachers such as the Franciscan Bernardino da Siena (e.g. in a 1427 sermon). Devotional activities focussed on different aspects of her life and were encouraged in Italy by both the church and the state, and many groups - not just women - felt drawn to her cult.  Rosika Parker suggests that 'heroic women who transcended in virtue all women and all humans' became a popular theme in Renaissance writing, and that they were increasingly portrayed as meek and domesticated figures. At this time, celebrations of the Assumption of the Virgin were increasingly embroidered on ecclesiastical vestments , complementing her image as Mary the mother. In this representation, the architectural sets and the scenes with her parents undoubtedly stress her humanity as well as the importance of her role as the mother of Jesus Christ.  (Mary Rogers and Paola Tinagli, <i>Women in Italy, 1350-1650. Ideals and Realities</i>. Manchester University Press, 2005, pp.17-8, 42-55; Rosika Parker, <i>The Subversive Stitch</i>.

The cope developed from a Roman cloak-like garment and was semi-circular, opening down the front. Orphrey bands ran the full length of the front opening. On the back, the cope retained a vestigial hood which was triangular or shield-shaped. 

Some of the saints depicted on the orphrey bands probably connect this cope to a Cologne church, or at least a church nearby. St Ursula and St Severinus were Cologne saints and St Hubert belonged to a military order established by the Archbishops-Elector of Cologne. Their embroidered names identify them.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The ground of the embroidery is executed in different textures and fillings of metallic thread, and some of it is raised work. The pattern on the velvet consists of an interrupted wavy diagonal stem, bearing on one side conventionalised pine-cones, and on the other pomegranates in a circle of leaves. This pattern is seen best on the back of the chasuble as the front has been pieced together. The back is also much less worn than the front, revealing the construction of the embroidery. It is lined in blue linen.

<i>Iconography</i> 
The orphreys depict scenes from the Life of the Virgin, mainly on backgrounds of gold and silver and were originally intended for a cope rather than a chasuble. They have been mutilated when recycled, the lowest compartment of the design cut to suit the length of the chasuble, and two of the remaining compartments used to trim the neckline. They have been unsympathetically used, so that the same scene is at the same level, but cannot be read left to right. Each scene comprises a group of people in an architectural setting, definitely classical in line rather than Gothic.The folds on the clothing of the figures are very carefully delineated.

Round the neck: 
(1) the death of the Virgin, lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles, and 
(2) the Assumption of the Virgin, borne up by angels with St Thomas by the tomb below.

On the back: 
(1) the Anunciation; the Virgin seated, the Angel kneeling, God the Father appearing in the clouds and the Dove descending; 
(2) the presentation of the Virgin in the Temple; she ascends the stair to the High Priest, her parents, St Anna and St Joachim, wait below; 
(3) the meeting of St Anna and St Joachim; they embrace before the Golden Gate of Jerusalem, an angel touches their heads and a manservant and maidservant attend them; 
(4) the rejection of St Joachim's offering: he carries away a lamb from the altar behind which three priests are sitting or standing; 
(5) the angel appearing to St Joachim among the shepherds, the lower part is missing. 

On the front orphrey: 
(1) the Announcement of the approaching death of the Virgin, she is seated, the angel bearing the palm kneels to her, behind her stand a group of the Apostles; 
(2) the betrothal of the Virgin to St Joseph; the priest joins their hands in the presence of St Anna and three suitors; the two figures on the extreme outer edges are very fashionable dressed for the mid 15th century
(3) the birth of the Virgin; St Anna in bed, a woman beside her and a servant bringing a bowl, the lower part cut away.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

This velvet is particularly complex because it comprises different forms of pile and incorporates metallic threads. It conforms to the usual widths of the period for such textiles (54-60 centimetres).

In Western Europe, expertise in velvet-weaving was restricted at this period to various Italian cities (e.g. Lucca, Florence, Genoa, Venice) and to certain centres in Spain, some of which had gained their knowledge through the import of Italian craftsmen (e.g. Valencia). The first records of velvet production in Lucca, Venice, Florence, and Genoa date to the beginning of the fourteenth century, as do the first records of their presence in royal and papal inventories. While Lucca was the earliest centre, the other three cities competed for leadership in the fifteenth and sixteenth century. 

Not surprisingly, velvet weavers earned more than their confreres who specialised in other silk textiles, and their earnings increased in direct proportion to the difficulty of the work involved: in the velvet hierarchy, at the bottom sat the weavers of solid velvets, at the top the weavers of pile-on-pile velvets with brocading and bouclé gold wefts. The former earned about one third of the wages of the latter.

In the sixteenth century sumptuary laws attempted - unsuccessfully - to reduce excessive expenditure on clothing and furnishings, restricting the use of such textiles in dress and forbidding it in canopies, blankets, curtains, and cushions.

The silk velvet of the chasuble was probably made in Italy, which boasted the most sophisticated centres of silk manufacturing in Europe in the 15th century.

The embroidery has been built up from a base of linen, stitched in coloured silk (in three shades of green, of blue and of red), silver, and silver-gilt thread, in couching, and long and short stitch. The ground of the embroidery is executed in different textures and fillings of metallic thread, and some of it is raised work. The pattern on the velvet consists of an interrupted wavy diagonal stem, bearing on one side conventionalised pine-cones, and on the other pomegranates in a circle of leaves. This pattern is seen best on the back of the chasuble as the front has been pieced together. The back is also much less worn than the front, revealing the construction of the embroidery. It is lined in blue linen.

<i>Iconography</i> 
The orphreys depict scenes from the Life of the Virgin, mainly on backgrounds of gold and silver and were originally intended for a cope rather than a chasuble. They have been mutilated when recycled, the lowest compartment of the design cut to suit the length of the chasuble, and two of the remaining compartments used to trim the neckline. They have been unsympathetically used, so that the same scene is at the same level, but cannot be read left to right. Each scene comprises a group of people in an architectural setting, definitely classical in line rather than Gothic.The folds on the clothing of the figures are very carefully delineated.

Round the neck: 
(1) the death of the Virgin, lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles, and 
(2) the Assumption of the Virgin, borne up by angels with St Thomas by the tomb below.

On the back: 
(1) the Anunciation; the Virgin seated, the Angel kneeling, God the Father appearing in the clouds and the Dove descending; 
(2) the presentation of the Virgin in the Temple; she ascends the stair to the High Priest, her parents, St Anna and St Joachim, wait below; 
(3) the meeting of St Anna and St Joachim; they embrace before the Golden Gate of Jerusalem, an angel touches their heads and a manservant and maidservant attend them; 
(4) the rejection of St Joachim's offering: he carries away a lamb from the altar behind which three priests are sitting or standing; 
(5) the angel appearing to St Joachim among the shepherds, the lower part is missing. 

On the front orphrey: 
(1) the Announcement of the approaching death of the Virgin, she is seated, the angel bearing the palm kneels to her, behind her stand a group of the Apostles; 
(2) the betrothal of the Virgin to St Joseph; the priest joins their hands in the presence of St Anna and three suitors; the two figures on the extreme outer edges are very fashionable dressed for the mid 15th century

The velvet is of the type usually described as <i>ferronerie</i>, because the pomegranate pattern is delineated by a fine outline thought to imitate ironwork. Four full widths of velvet and two three-quarter widths make up the garment, the two central widths are intact, the other panels reveal how carefully this costly textile was used as the outer edges that form the circle have been pieced together from a number of small pieces. A deep fringe is attached round the semi-circular side - probably a later addition although such fringes were used in the Middle Ages. The whole of the cope is lined with deep blue linen (in excellent condition) - also pieced together.

<i>The orphrey bands</i> are embroidered with images of saints (see below), in coloured silks (blue, green, red and brown) and gold thread (Cologne work); there is evidence that originally sequins were sewn on to the blue background embroidery: a few sequins have survived on images of St Lucy and St Severinus, and the reddish thread that attached them to these and other parts of the embroidery is visible against the blue in all cases. The faces of the saints are stitched in white, but the features seem to have been drawn on below the surface (possibly a similar technique to that used as in Butler Bowdon cope). There is also evidence of restoration work executed in white thread, couched down, especially on the right hand side (when worn). A fine yellow braid/ribbon is sewn over the edges of the ophreys on both sides. It dates to either the late 19th or early 20th century.

<i>The hood</i> is of couched gold thread, with figures representing the Death of the Virgin Mary and is very worn. The draperies were originally of gold threads, whipped round with fine coloured silks; the heads of the various figures are of canvas embroidered with fine silks in long and short stitches. A narrow red and white fringe is sewn around the hood. It is lined with blue linen, a shade lighter than the lining of the rest of the cope.

<i>Iconography</i>.  The figures depicted on the orphreys are saints who each inhabit a similar space, placed below a castellated wall, under a decorative Gothic arch, they stand on a tesselated floor; below the floor, in Latin, is the inscription bearing the appropriate name. When the cope was on the clergyman's body, the saints faced each other across the opening: from bottom to top, St John the Baptist faced St Hubert, St Ursula faced St Lucy, St Severinus faced St Bernadino and Saint Elizabeth faced St Mary Magdalene. The textiles worn by the saints (as long flowing robes) echo the pattern found on the velvet of the cope - large, abstract pomegranate designs. Each saint carries the appropriate indicator of status and attribute: the bishops Severinus and Hubert wear mitres and carry croziers, those of royal lineage, Ursula and Elizabeth (of Hungary) wear crowns, the martyrs, Ursula and Lucy carry palm fronds. Mary Magdalen is depicted with long flowing tresses, holding a vase of ointment; Elizabeth holding a garment (no doubt an allusion to those she made for those in need). 

The hood shows the death of the Virgin. She lies in a rectilinear bed in a room with a window on the left hand side above the bed. Round the bed are twelve male figures with haloes round their heads. Eleven are bald and bearded, the twelfth is clean-shaven and has a full head of hair. He is holding a jar (?). He and two other saints in the group are behind the bed, looking towards the Virgin; one of them holds a palm branch. To their right is another group whose attention is focussed on an object that looks like an incense burner. In front of the bed side two saints looking at a book, and to their right is another saint with a book who looks as if he is reading to the assembled crowd.  Only the faces, hands and hair of the saints is executed in silk (much worn); the rest of the embroidery (draperies, bed, background) is in different metal threads (the Virgin's robes, sheet and pillow, probably in silver-gilt; the saints'/apostles' garments, bed, bedcover, background) in gold. The metal threads are couched down, the background using a red silk, and creating a geometric diaper pattern. The ground is badly worn, so much of the brownish linen base textile is visible. The haloes are worked in a succession of curving rays, which shows up the gold to great advantage. A shield has been applied centre bottom of the hood; it is divided in half, the left blue with two silver cylinders, the right red with a gold band at the top and two gold chevrons over the red. Round the edge of the hood is a half-inch band of brick stitch embroidery in metal thread, and attached round the outer edge of that band is a narrow braid in red and white (half-inch), ending in a fringe.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Caskets were made and used by girls in the 17th century. The girls would decorate small panels with embroidery which would then be sent to a cabinet-maker to be made up into a casket. They were often fitted with compartments for sewing and writing as well as a small mirror. Many cabinets also had secret compartments, used to store personal possessions such as jewellery or letters. The high cost of the materials, as well as the skill needed to create these caskets, means they could only have been made in wealthy households.

<b>People</b>
The panels were worked by young girls, aged around 11 or 12, as part of their education. Girls started learning needlework skills aged 6 or 7, first creating a band sampler (see T.433-1990) and then moving on to more complex pieces such as cutwork. Embroidering the panels of a casket or for a mirror (see T.17-1955) appears to have been one of the last stages of a girl’s needlework education. These skills would be useful later in life in the management of a household.

<b>Materials & Designs</b>
Biblical, mythological and classical scenes were all popular themes for decorating caskets. While some girls may have designs their own panels, taking inspiration from sources such as illustrated bibles, it also appears to have been possible to have purchased designs, which the embroiderer could then customise by using certain colours or adding in features. Most of the caskets in the V&amp;A collection are decorated with many different stitches to showcase the skill of the embroiderer, unusually this casket is decorated almost entirely in tent stitch.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The chasuble is an example of the richly decorated vestments commissioned for use in the Church. This particular example is typical of the International Gothic style favoured in the fifteenth centuries, the silk velvet characterised by scrolling motifs consistent with a dating of the late fifteenth century. Such a silk was suitable for both secular and ecclesiastical use, and might have been made in an Italian or Spanish centre (the most developed in Europe at this time). At that period chasubles were conical in shape, rather than fiddle- or violin-shaped, so this garment must have been altered at a later date (after the beginning of the seventeenth century). The silk may even have begun its life as a different form of dress or furnishing altogether, no major distinction between secular and ecclesiastical designs being made at that time. The orphreys may well date to earlier in the century, their composition and treatment being similar to Italian paintings of the 1420-50 period. The dimensions of the compartments of the orphreys may be useful eventually in identifying the geographical location of making (when guild regulations become easily accessible for different cities). Currently, identification can only be speculative, based on the aesthetics of the images. It is possible that these orphrey bands were originally intended/used for a cope. The embroidery was probably executed either in a professional workshop (urban or church) or by nuns. Certain similarities with the needlework image of St Verdiana (Viridiana) (4216-1857) in terms of composition and architectural setting are very evident; it is thought to be Florentine.

<i>Iconography of orphreys</i> 
The Life of the Virgin is told in the embroidered panels on the orphreys in eight vignettes, including the Annunciation and Assumption. Rogers and Tinagli note that from as early as the 2nd century, Mary's virtues of humility, obedience, modesty and silence were extolled in contrast to Eve's negative characteristics, and that in the early fifteenth century such ideas were communicated to a wider audience visually via Fra Angelico's Annunciation scenes, and verbally by preachers such as the Franciscan Bernardino da Siena (e.g. in a 1427 sermon). Devotional activities focussed on different aspects of her life and were encouraged in Italy by both the church and the state, and many groups - not just women - felt drawn to her cult.  Rosika Parker suggests that 'heroic women who transcended in virtue all women and all humans' became a popular theme in Renaissance writing, and that they were increasingly portrayed as meek and domesticated figures. At this time, celebrations of the Assumption of the Virgin were increasingly embroidered on ecclesiastical vestments , complementing her image as Mary the mother. In this representation, the architectural sets and the scenes with her parents undoubtedly stress her humanity as well as the importance of her role as the mother of Jesus Christ.  (Mary Rogers and Paola Tinagli, <i>Women in Italy, 1350-1650. Ideals and Realities</i>. Manchester University Press, 2005, pp.17-8, 42-55; Rosika Parker, <i>The Subversive Stitch</i>.

By the thirteenth century clerical attire was more or less stabilized throughout the Latin Christian church. According to the <i>Rationale for the Divine Offices</i> of the canonist and liturgist William Durandus (d. 1296), all ranks of the higher clergy were entitled to wear the cope (or <i>pluviale</i>) for processional occasions on feast days. As a result, inventories of monastic churches testify to the existence of a very large number of copes, Canterbury, for example, owning no fewer than sixty copes in 1315. (Dyan Elliot, 'Dressing and Undressing the Clergy',  in E. Jane Burns ed. <i>Medieval Fabrications. Dress, Textiles, Cloth, and Other Cultural Imaginings</i>. London, 2004, pp. 56-58; Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds, 2002, p. 11.)

The cope had developed from the same Roman garment (<i>paenula</i>) as had the chasuble, but by the eleventh century had a different form: it was semi-circular and open down the front; the front opening fastened just below the neck across the chest with a short strip of embroidered material or a morse (a metal clasp); orphrey bands ran the full length of the front opening and on the back, the cope retained a vestigial hood which was triangular or shield-shaped (as in this example). (Johnstone, op.cit.) The cope was so voluminous that its rich materials lent themselves to recycling for other purposes. There are many surviving examples of chasubles and dalmatics made of this kind of silk velvet, but fewer examples of full copes, some of which may have been cut down into other less voluminous vestments. Christa Mayer-Thurman illustrates and describes similar velvet copes or pieces of cope in different liturgical colours (green, purple, blue and red) in <i>European Textiles. The Robert Lehman Collection</i>, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2001, pp. 74-87; Donald King illustrates and describes part of a red velvet cope from Italy or Spain in <i>European Textiles in the Keir Collection 400BC to 1800AD</i>, London, 1990, cat. 49, p. 76.

<i>Iconography</i>. 
The saints depicted in the orphrey bands probably connect the cope to a Cologne church, or at least a church nearby - and their identity is reinforced by the lettering below their image and attributes. Two of them, St Ursula and St Severinus were Cologne saints. Severinus was not very popular elsewhere. St Hubert seems to have been the dedicatee of a military order established by the Archbishops-Elector of Cologne and was frequently represented in the Cologne area. See Conversion and Mass of St Hubert panels in National Gallery (Glyn Davies). The composition of the Death of the Virgin on the hood is likely to relate closely to imagery in paintings of the period. The depiction of the figures suggests that the scene is based on the Apocryphal Gospel, in particular the passage narrating the moment of the Virgin's death, surrounded by eleven of the Apostles (according to that source, St. Thomas was preaching in remote countries and did not return in time). Here there are, however, twelve apostles, John being the youngest and represented as such, beardless. The symbols that are difficult to make out in the embroidery, because of wear, are probably the palm, All Souls Book, censer and candles.

<i>Textile</i>. Silk velvets of this type were woven in centres in Italy and Spain during the fifteenth and sixteenth century. They were often called 'ferronerie' velvets because the effect created is similar to that of ironwork. They ranked among the most expensive luxury textiles of the time.

Dye analysis, carried out at the Institut Royal du Patrimoine Artistique in Brussels in 2007 by Inge Vanden Berghe, identified the red dyestuffs as insect red and tannin (gallnuts), with a trace of red wood. Her conclusion was that the red velvet was dyed with precious red insect dyes: Polish cochineal alone, or a combination of the very expensive kermes with Armenian cochineal. All three dyes sources were in use in Europe in the fifteenth century. According to the study done by Hofenk de Graaf on red dye sources used between 1450  and 1600 (based on TLC analysis), Polish cochineal was often found in Italian silks, whereas often Armenian cochineal or kermes were detected in red fifteenth century silks with a Spanish origin. She also notes that the use of gallnut for silk weighting, in the case of a later dyeing of light colours as scarlet and crimson shades, was most likely in fifteenth century Spain. (Judith H. Hofenk de Graaff. <i>The Colourful past: origins, chemistry and identification of natural dyesfuffs</i>. Abegg-Stiftung and Archetype publications ltd., 2004, esp. pp. 62 and 68).

<i>Embroidery</i> 
The way in which the haloes are worked in a succession of curving rays is evidently characteristic of German embroidery (Johnstone, p. 75), and may be compared with the piece from the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich illustrated in her book as Fig. 86, and with the Bohemian chasuble bought from Bock by this museum in the following year (1375-1864). The application of metal threads in a diaper pattern in the ground is also similar.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

As the fashion for wearing boots when out and about grew, it became practical to adopt a new type of comfortable shoe for use exclusively in the home.  Some women purchased patterns and embroidered slippers for themselves or their husbands.  

Here silk braids have been stitched to the black woollen 'upper' in the shape of flowers, leaves and scrolls.  The process of attaching one material to another in this way is called appliqué.  The pale blue silk edging and lining were probably chosen to correspond with the pale blue of some of the flowers.

Only a privileged few, however, were able to afford the time and materials for embroidery.  There appear to have been a number of accepted markers in the development of a competent needlewoman.

In particular these pictures employ raised work, the technique of embroidering over padding.

It is probable that each individual figure or element was sewn independently and then applied to the delicate white satin background.  This meant that the needlewoman could experiment and correct mistakes which would be impossible to rework on the satin.  
This picture, almost certainly derived from a contemporary print, tells the Old Testament story of Esther and Ahasuerus.  In the centre of the embroidery, Esther, the Jewish wife of the Persian king Ahasuerus warns her husband of a plot by his prime minister Haman to kill all the Jews in his realm.  Ahasuerus gestures with his sceptre while Esther holds out a scroll inscribed 'At my petition'.  The resulting execution of Haman is depicted in the top left corner of the embroidery.  The picture is marked in ink with the initials MI and the date 1665 below the central scene.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

17th or 18th century

This dress was acquired on the Greek island of Karpathos in 1884. It is made in one piece, but has the appearance of a tunic and skirt as a deep pleat has been taken into it, a way of adjusting the length. The silk for the fabric and the embroidery threads was produced locally on Karpathos, as was the dye, which obtained its characteristic deep green from lichen.

Sleeves ballooned in shape, and skirts fanned out to emphasise a tiny waist. Hairstyles and headgear became equally exuberant, in contrast to the classical simplicity of the turn of the century. Decoration and trimmings reflected a nostalgia for the costume of the past, seen in stomacher-shaped bodices and 'vandyked' (zig-zag shaped) collars inspired by portraits from the seventeenth century.

This dress may well have been a wedding dress as it is so rich in detail and trimmings. White weddings were becoming widespread as a result of the fashion for muslin dresses. Before the 1800s most people wore coloured dresses to their marriage ceremony, which they continued to wear for special occasions long after the event.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Needleworkers (<i>rafugars</i>) had traditionally been employed in the shawl-weaving process to repair and join together the individual pieces that made up the garment. During the early nineteenth century they began to embroider the entire shawl, copying the woven originals as well as following new patterns. This was introduced as a cost-cutting measure as embroidered shawls were easier and quicker to manufacture.

The caskets were fitted inside with a variety of compartments, suitable for keeping jewellery, cosmetics, writing equipment and letters, needlework tools, tiny toys or keepsakes. They often had mirrors set into their lids, for dressing, and sometimes had secret drawers, in which to keep particularly precious possessions.

The panels of the casket would have been worked by a young girl, probably around age 11 or 12, as the culmination of her needlework education, which would have begun with samplers and the decoration of small objects like pin cushions. She would embroider a series of small panels drawn or printed with pictorial scenes, which would then be sent to a cabinetmaker to be made up into a casket, the edges bound with braid. The cost of the materials and the involvement of a cabinetmaker in making up such an item means that it could only have belonged to a household which could afford such an outlay.

The casket came to the museum with its protective case, made to protect the delicate surfaces of the embroidery. This has helped to preserve it from damage and the fading of its fresh colours.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Some women embroidered the ready-made uppers of their slippers themselves although it is difficult to say whether this was the case here.

Adolfo Sardiña started out as a milliner in New York in the early 1950s. In 1962, he opened his own salon, designing clothes to accompany his hats. His earliest designs treated each piece as an individual, special item that could be worn separately, or assembled together into a exuberant whole. While the concept was at odds with the principle of co-ordinating, easy-wear separates that distinguished American sportswear design, Adolfo's elaborate clothes proved popular with his wealthy customers. After the 1960s his designs became dramatically simpler and more elegantly restrained.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The pattern of diagonal scrolls is made of areas of maroon cut velvet, pink uncut velvet, cut and uncut yellow velvet, with a voided ground of white silk with silver strip.  The coat has a round neckline, bound with a narrow strip of velvet.  The shaped, two-piece sleeves are slightly loose and end above the wrists with a deep round cuff (17.5 cm at top, 20.5 cm at bottom). The fronts curve from neck to hem with wide skirts below the hip, set in two pleats (17.5 cm) either side of the side openings.  There is an inverted pleat either side of the opening at centre back.  There is a scalloped pocket flap on each coat front at hip level.  The pockets are lined with bleached linen.  The front edges, cuffs, pocket flaps and front skirts are interlined.  There are 20 velvet-covered buttons on the right front, from neck to hem, but only 11 buttonholes on the left front, from neck to the pocket flap.  There are 5 buttons below each pocket flap, one on each side above the pleats, and 5 at the top edge of each cuff.

The waistcoat fronts and back skirts are made of the silk velvet, the backs of beige wool broacloth.  The neckline is round and bound with a narrow strip of velvet.  The fronts curve from waist to hem with wide skirts below the hem, reaching to mid-thigh.  There is a scalloped pocket flap on each waistcoat front at hip level.  The pockets and waistcoat torso are lined with fustian; the pocket flaps with ivory silk satin, the front edges faced with the satin.  The front edges are interlined. There are 20 small, velvet-covered buttons on the right front, from neck to hem, but only 14 buttonholes on the left front, from neck to pocket flap. 

The breeches are made of the silk velvet and cut in two fronts, two, pieced backs and a two-piece waistband.  The back is higher than thefront, with the fullness gathered into the waistbands.  The breeches have a fall front, with a pocket and pocket flap on each side, a watch pocket in the front of the right waistband, and a pocket in the right side seam.  The pockets and waistbands are lined with fustian, the fall front with ivory silk satin.  The legs are unlined and the seams bound with coarse, unbleached linen tape.  The waistbands are interlined with buckram. There are 3 large velvet-covered button (2 now missing) and buttonholes fastening the waistbands,  one small button for the pocket flaps and 4 on the outside of each leg.  Buckle bands secure the bottom of the legs. 

The lining of the coat and waistcoat skirts had been covered over or replaced with cream silk satin, probably in the 19th century.  The breeches have been altered either for fancy dress or display.  The waistband linings were removed. A piece of maroon velvet has been sewn to the right front waistband and one of the buttons sewn to it to enlarge the waist.  An additional waistband of cream wool flannel has been added above the waistbands, with cotton-covered wooden buttons at the front and top edges for braces.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

In 1955 he won the Coty Fashion award for his designs for Emmé Millinery. In 1962, he opened his own salon and began designing clothes to accompany his hats. He believed that hats should be worn as an accessory rather than a necessity, and carried this over into his clothing designs. His late 1960s fashions treated each piece as an individual and special item by itself, that could be worn together or separately. Although the principle of American sportswear embraces the concept of co-ordinating separates and a relaxed mix-and-match philosophy, the extravagance of Adolfo's designs sat slightly at odds with this philosophy. Even so, his clothes were popular with his wealthy customers.

During the 1960s Adolfo designed cloaks in felt, richly beaded and braided velvet bolero jackets, peasant-looks, and organdy blouses worn under floral overalls, or with extravagant patchwork evening looks (as here). In 1968, he remarked ""Today, one has to dress in bits and pieces—the more the merrier."" By 1969 he described his clothes as being ""for a woman's fun and fantasy moods—I don't think the classic is appealing to people any more.""

In 1970, Adolfo suddenly changed his design approach, abandoning these extravagant designs for knitwear and understatement. He continued designing splendid eveningwear, though practicality was combined with luxury, such as evening sweaters with ballgown skirts, fur-trimmed knits, caftans and evening pyjamas.

It shows the high standard of French needlework and the sequence of decorating and sewing up these opulent formal garments. A length of cream silk satin has had the outline of a panel drawn onto it, which has then been decorated to shape. When cut out and sewn, it would have formed the left side of the wearer's train. The matching petticoat and bodice of the robe parée would have been embroidered with the same pattern.

The rich labour-intensive work shows 18th century French embroidery at its most complex. The cream satin ground has pink, mauve and green silk appliqué, folded to create the illusion of swagged fabric drapes. Swansdown, coloured metal threads, chenille embroidery, and small beads of padded satin add further detail and texture.

However, the requirements of court dress kept alive the textile and embroidery industries of the 18th century.  The embroidery for the coat and waistcoat were done first, in the areas where it was required for the finished garment.

About 1810

Napoleon’s imperial court revived the etiquette of dress from before the Revolution. High-waisted gowns continued in vogue, using a variety of fabrics suited to the formality of different occasions. White muslin was worn in informal dress and lustrous silk for formal events. Machine-made net, or tulle, proved an ideal ground for hand-embroidery in contrasting silk, metal thread and spangles, or, as here, in tufted chenille thread. Tulle was a new product manufactured in England and France.

In this outfit he  recycled an antique crazy-patchwork quilt to make the skirt, neck ruff and wrist ruffles. Despite this element of ‘cannibalisation’, he has treated the historic textile with respect, gathering rather than cutting it to make the skirt. This appreciation of quilts as textile art first emerged in the 1960s.

Adolfo Sardiña started out as a milliner in New York in the early 1950s. In 1962, he opened his own salon, designing clothes to accompany his hats. His earliest designs treated each piece as an individual, special item that could be worn separately, or assembled together into a exuberant whole. While the concept was at odds with the principle of co-ordinating, easy-wear separates that distinguished American sportswear design, Adolfo's elaborate clothes proved popular with his wealthy customers. After the 1960s his designs became dramatically simpler and more elegantly restrained.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Plain sewing - hemming and seaming - was of particular value for the production of underclothes and basic household linens.  Only a privileged few, however, were able to afford the time and materials for embroidery.  There appear to have been a number of accepted markers in the development of a competent needlewoman.  First a band sampler was completed, illustrating the range of stitches and techniques that the girl had mastered.  Then these skills were developed by sewing a more complex and demanding cut-work sampler.  In many cases the final challenge was the production of a casket like this one, depicting scenes from myth or the Bible using a wide range of stitches and materials.  In particular these caskets employ raised work, the technique of embroidering over padding.

It is probable that each individual figure or element was sewn independently and then applied to the delicate white satin background.  This meant that the needlewoman could experiment and correct mistakes which would be impossible to rework on the satin.  Once the panels were completed they were sent to a local cabinet-maker who mounted them on wood and made them up into a casket.  The silver braid conceals the joins and prevents the satin from fraying. 

Different scenes, almost certainly derived from contemporary prints, adorn each of the five visible surfaces of the casket.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

It shows the high standard of French needlework and the sequence of decorating and sewing up these opulent formal garments. A length of cream silk satin has had the outline of a panel drawn onto it, which has then been decorated to shape. When cut out and sewn, it would have formed the left side of the wearer's train. The matching petticoat and bodice of the robe parée would have been embroidered with the same pattern.

The rich labour-intensive work shows 18th century French embroidery at its most complex. The cream satin ground has pink, mauve and green silk appliqué, folded to create the illusion of swagged fabric drapes. Swansdown, coloured metal threads, chenille embroidery, and small beads of padded satin add further detail and texture.

Skyros had been under the control of Venice from the mid 15th century, but became Turkish territory in 1538.  The designs of Skyros embrodieries were heavily influenced by the floral style of Turkish ceramics like those from Isnik, and included many birds, ships and human figures, particularly men in Turkish dress, which during the 18th century became the normal male dress in the Aegean Islands.

The scale of the embroidery pattern, its range of textures and use of metallic threads are reminiscent of the Baroque style, commanding splendid effects in rich materials. However, the design demonstrates characteristic Rococo elements of scrolls, naturalistic ornament and extravagant forms; with the regular sinuous pattern of ornate scroll shaped leaves and diapered infilling introducing the lighter grace of the Rococo style.

1730–40

This richly embroidered waistcoat is an example of lavish European court dress. The bright yellow colour was fashionable for both men and women. The generous length and the pocket flaps allowed for rich decoration. The design includes Rococo motifs such as a sinuous pattern of scrolling leaves, but the bold treatment and large scale of the vegetation are more characteristic of the earlier Baroque style. The metal threads, when new, would have created a glittering effect.

John Heathcote's bobbinet machine, patented in 1809, enabled fine net to be easily produced in wide widths for dresses, which could be hand-embroidered to achieve individual and attractive effects. Net dresses were worn with underdresses of plain silk, sometimes white, or in a matching colour.

Chenille (French for caterpillar) is a type of thick thread made by a weaving process. Cotton or silk is woven into a length of cloth which is then cut into very narrow strips, the severed weft threads creating the tufts which give the yarn its velvety texture. The dense colour of chenille thread creates a contrasting effect with the ground fabric.

Fashion leaders such as Empress Josephine, Napoleon's first wife, helped to popularise dresses of machine net, or 'tulle', which was also produced in France. She owned many machine-made net dresses embroidered with silver or gold metal thread and spangles for formal court occasions.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Satin panels worked with silk thread. Raised work, metal thread, mica and glass beads are also used in decoration. The panels are edged with wood and the casket has spherical wooden feet.

On the lid, there is a cartouche showing Issac meeting Rebekah. The initials S.V are embroidered above the sun and clouds. Around the edge of the lid are small motifs including poppies, pomegranates, sunflowers, parrots and butterflies. The front doors show Abraham entertaining the Angels. The left side of the casket depicts Eliezer giving betrothal gifts to Rebekah, and the right show Eliezer taking leave of Abraham. On the back there is a central scene of Abraham with Hagar and Ishmael and to their right is Sarah and Issac in a tent and to their left an angel appears to Hagar in the wilderness. 

The interior is also decorated with embroidery, the drawer fronts have geometric flowers in laid work. The inside of the top compartment is decorated with a 3D miniature garden with flour plots, fruit trees and ivory figures. The interior and exterior panels are edged with wood. 

<b>Construction </b>
The casket is comprised of two key segments, the top segment is revealed by opening the lid. The interior is split into two segments with the garden taking up the majority of space.

In 1955 he won the Coty Fashion award for his designs for Emmé Millinery. In 1962, he opened his own salon and began designing clothes to accompany his hats. He believed that hats should be worn as an accessory rather than a necessity, and carried this over into his clothing designs. His late 1960s fashions treated each piece as an individual and special item by itself, that could be worn together or separately. Although the principle of American sportswear embraces the concept of co-ordinating separates and a relaxed mix-and-match philosophy, the extravagance of Adolfo's designs sat slightly at odds with this philosophy. Even so, his clothes were popular with his wealthy customers.

During the 1960s Adolfo designed cloaks in felt, richly beaded and braided velvet bolero jackets, peasant-looks, and organdy blouses worn under floral overalls, or with extravagant patchwork evening looks (as here). In 1968, he remarked ""Today, one has to dress in bits and pieces—the more the merrier."" By 1969 he described his clothes as being ""for a woman's fun and fantasy moods—I don't think the classic is appealing to people any more.""

In 1970, Adolfo suddenly changed his design approach, abandoning these extravagant designs for knitwear and understatement. He continued designing splendid eveningwear, though practicality was combined with luxury, such as evening sweaters with ballgown skirts, fur-trimmed knits, caftans and evening pyjamas.

The silk damask has a symmetrical pattern created through the ground weave and supplementary brocading wefts. The ground is a classic European pattern of scrolling stems which form compartments. These compartments enclose symmetrical floral motifs in silver gilt thread. The larger of the two motifs is basically round in shape, and looks as if the branches scroll out from a basket; the smaller is much more like a tiny multi-petalled flower.

The orphreys comprise a silk band on to which embroidered motifs have been appliqued. Before application to the chasuble, the embroidery was executed on a linen base, a layer of light-coloured yellow silk having been used between the linen and the embroidery for the hands and faces.The colours used are: green (3 shades), blue (3 shades), flesh (2 shades). The stitches used are long and short stitch, satin stitch and couching. The heavy signs of wear on the front orphrey band leave visible the basis on which the embroidery was constructed (linen ground, silk layer and then embroidery, as well as the linen thread padding used for raised areas of the design). The front orphrey has been shortened to fit the current vestment, evident because the lower part of the saint is missing. 

<i>Iconography</i> 
Each orphrey bears three female saints who stand within architectural compartments.These compartments are a standard size: 15 inches long x 7 inches wide. The compartments consist of three levels of motifs which throw attention on to the central female figure: a castellated roof over a domed ceiling above the saint's head, 'mid-figure', a background of plain red scattered with embroidered flowers, and on the ground, a tesselated floor. The richness of the materials increases from bottom to top in each compartment. The saints on the back all look in the same direction (towards their right), while those on the front look towards the left. The clothing of the saints follows a formula: each has a halo, wears a gown and mantle and carries the attribute that leads to identification; the halo and mantle are gold, the gown either blue (3 shades) or green (3 shades).The folds of the gown are emphasised by the different shades of the same colour, disposed vertically. On the front orphrey, (from top to bottom) are portrayed St Margaret, St Ursula (?) and three-quarters of a full-length St Barbara; on the back, St Lucy, St Helena (?) and St Catherine of Alexandria (the orphrey has been cut down possibly when the chasuble shape was altered). All but St Helena carry the palm branch that denotes martyrdom, and wear crowns denoting royal birth. St Margaret stands on the dragon (Satan), who swallowed her during her ordeals. St Ursula has an arrow in her hand. St Catherine leans against the wheel on which she was tortured. St Barbara carries the tower in which her father shut her, and St Lucy holds a plate on which her eyes lie.

St Helena (canonised 330), mother of Constantine, carries a patriarchal cross, which may suggest the identification in the original accession register. St Ursula is extremely fashionably dressed for about 1420-40, both in terms of her gown with its high, emphasised waistline, and her 'large' and elaborate hair style (Margaret Scott. <i>Medieval Dress and Fashion</i>. British Museum Press, 2007, pp.135 & 139).","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The orphrey was perhaps originally intended for a cope. Like the embroidery, the green silk damask, with I.3 twill brocade, is of Spanish origin.

Occasionally, as in this example, their motifs included the figures of the donors.The figures can be identified by their names embroidered in the scrolls above them, but unfortunately nothing more is known about these individuals. They must have been fairly wealthy  to be able to afford this costly embroidery. The dates of the figures are indicated by their clothing, the ones above being in dress of a slightly earlier period than the younger couple seen below. Henry Smyth, the husband in the upper pair, has the characteristic 'bowl crop' haircut that went out of  fashion around 1460, though the style still appears occasionally after that date.  His shoes are high around the ankle and cut with a deep 'V', in a fashion of the second half of the 15th century. Johanna or Joan, his wife wears a loose-fitting gown with a long train, a style that dates from around 1450-1470.The man below, Thomas Smyth, has a 'pageboy' haircut. His wife, who has the same name as the woman above, Johanna or Joan, wears a gown of a style that suggests a date close to 1500.Other interesting details include the two tasselled cushions on which the upper couple are kneeling and the large pouch or purse worn at the waist of Thomas Smyth. The cuffs and skirts of all the figures have scalloped  borders in gold. Although still bright and fairly fresh looking, the colours have faded. The gowns of the two lower figures were originally red but are now a dull cream. The yellows and greens were brighter as well, and the blue velvet background had a much deeper hue. Together with the details in gold, the figures and flower motifs would  have stood out even more vividly than they do now.

Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. The front is more worn than the back because it has rubbed against the altar. Simple columnar embroidered orphreys (decorative bands) adorn the back and front. All of the figures are of female saints, which may suggest that the orphreys were intended for vestments for a convent.

The silk of the chasuble was probably made in Italy, which boasted the most sophisticated centres of silk manufacturing in Europe in the 15th century. The shape dates to the 17th century or later. Precious silk and fine embroidery, especially containing metallic threads, were used economically and were often recycled.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The chasuble is an example of the richly decorated vestments commissioned for use in the Church. This particular example is typical of the International Gothic style favoured in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the silk characterised by the motif of gold floral devices (consistent with a dating of 1420s or 1430s). Such a silk was suitable for both secular and ecclesiastical use, and might have been made in an Italian or Spanish centre. At that period chasubles were conical in shape, rather than fiddle- or violin-shaped, so this garment must have been altered at a later date (after the beginning of the seventeenth century). The orphreys are both embroidered with purely ecclesiastical iconography, and according to Johnstone, the use of the pillar form on both back and front was most common south of the Alps (Johnstone, p. 141). The dimensions of the compartments of the orphreys may be useful eventually in identifying the geographical location of making (when guild regulations become easily accessible for different cities). Currently, identification can only be speculated upon based on the aesthetics of the images. It is possible that these orphrey bands were originally intended/used for a cope, especially as the figures face in opposite directions and might therefore have faced each other across the central opening. The embroidery was probably executed either in a professional workshop (urban or church) or by nuns.

<i>Iconography of orphreys</i> 
It is intriguing that only female saints adorn these orphrey bands, and raises the question of the institution for which they were commissioned. Might such imagery have been more appropriate for a convent than for a parish church, cathedral, abbey or monastery? The saints all came from different localities and their cult began at different periods. It would be worth investigating whether there is some significance attached to their representation here as a group. Rogers and Tinagli note that in fifteenth century Italy male authorities considered devotion to female saints especially appropriate for women, and that women were usually given the names of saints; some families represented these saints in specially commissioned altarpieces. Their namesakes were taken as role models whose virtues could be emulated (e.g Helena and Ursula were seen as pilgrims). Female saints might also be invoked to protect women in certain circumstances (e.g. Margaret in the case of childbirth). Saints who had refused arranged or forced marriages acted as examples for nuns or prospective nuns (e.g. Ursula and Catherine) while Renaissance saints found a precedent for their visionary experience in the story of the Mystic Marriage of St Catherine. (Mary Rogers and Paola Tinagli, <i>Women in Italy, 1350-1650. Ideals and Realities</i>. Manchester University Press, 2005, pp. 56-7. These authors offer a series of primary texts on the subject).

The heavily draped clothing and the covering of her head in the depiction of the saint on the centre back suggests an older woman, and the patriarchal cross surely refers to the legends about the finding of the True Cross. It is therefore reasonable to identify this saint as St. Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine, the first Roman emperor to champion the cause of Christianity. A contemporary historian of the Church wrote that Helena, from the time of her conversion led an earnestly Christian life and contributed to the spread of Christianity. Tradition links her name with the building of Christian churches in the cities of the West (at Rome and Trier) and she is known to have erected churches on the holy ground in Palestine (from which sprang her association with the finding of the True Cross). She died at the advanced age of 80, and was soon revered as a saint. The veneration spread, early in the ninth century, even to Western countries.  (www.ichrusa.com/saintsalive/constant.htm; www.newadvent.org/cathen/07202b.htm [both accessed 21/06/2007]).

<i>Colour</i> 
The combination of red and green surely means that this vestment could have been used for either everyday or for martyrs' days - in line with liturgical conventions of green for everyday and red for martyrs.

A useful outline of the William Durandus' stipulations on vestments in <i>The Divine Offices</i> is to be found in Dyan Elliot. 'Dressing and undressing the clergy'. In <i>Medieval Fabrications.

Under Yoshimitsu the Zen principles of restraint, understatement, economy of movement and frugality of expression became incorporated into the performance. By the early seventeenth century Nô had become an even more austere and formalised drama reserved almost exclusively for the ruling military elite.

The kariginu has its origins in the style of wide-sleeved hunting cloak worn as an informal garment by courtiers of the Heian period (794-1185). The kariginu in the Nô drama is an outer robe to be worn by actors in the role of nobles or gods.

This striking and luxurious lined kariginu is made from dark green silk with bold design in gold (kinran) of interlocking hexagons (kikkô), sixteen-petalled chrysanthemums (kiku) and flaming wheel roundels containing triple-comma motifs (mitsu-tomoe).

At the time when the hanging was made, the head of the family was Henry Sandys 5th Baron, who was killed in a Civil War skirmish in 1644. When the Revd Joseph of Basingstoke described the hanging in 1819, it was in Mottisfont House in Hampshire, where it belonged to Sir Charles Mill Bartholemew, a descendent of the Sandys Family.

The remainder of the chapel fittings are also enumerated, from a description given by  the steward to the Mottisfont Estate, Thomas King. They consisted of an altar frontal embroidered with the Last Supper, some pieces of purple velvet with the initials IHS, a desk hanging of purple velvet embroidered in gold and silver with the arms of Sandys, two book covers and a folding cushion with the letters 'THS' on the outside and the arms of Sandys on the inside.

They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Ornamental patchwork bed hangings and quilted bed covers reflected a household's access to a range of fashionable textiles, from colourful imported chintzes to sumptuous silk velvets. Many were bought specially, but householders also recycled textiles from other objects, a common practice given the financial and emotional investment in valuable fabrics.

This patchwork of silks and velvets would have been made as a bedcover or screen. The original design incorporates small embroidered panels, and a wide variety of plain and
patterned silks. A less technically accomplished hand has added figurative embroidery and appliqué to many of the patches after the completion of the piecing. The additional embroidery shows a wide range of popular needlework subjects, including four chinoiserie figures and a scene from Aesop’s fable ‘The Fox and the Vase’. 

No information concerning the provenance of the coverlet was available when it was acquired, but when the later lining was removed for conservation, it revealed an early eighteenth century paper template. Newspaper cuttings relating to the trial of Titus Oates and an advertisement for a proprietary medicine date the template to around 1705. Plain paper has also been used in several areas. Because paper was an expensive consumer item, it was common practice in even the wealthiest households to recycle it. Alongside the range of silks, this suggests an affluent household with access to a range of luxury consumer goods. In 1709 the Female Tatler described the exciting experience of shopping for such goods: ‘The shops are perfect gilded theatres . . . As people glance within their doors, they salute them with – Garden silks, ladies Italian silks, brocades, tissues, cloth of silver or cloth of gold, very fine mantua silks, any right Geneva velvet, English velvet, velvet embossed.’","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as ‘piecing over paper’. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. The papers are usually removed once the project is complete. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples, such as this cover of squares and triangles. The work is often embellished with appliqué and embroidery to enhance the design. A bedcover that has been pieced but not wadded is often referred to as a coverlet.

This patchwork of fashionable silks was probably made to form part of a larger bed cover or screen, and was hand-pieced over paper.

The blue calf leather glove shown in this image was hand-sewn. The seams are finely oversewn using a contrasting white silk thread. The glove is simply and elegantly decorated with long points worked with a double row of white tambour (chain) stitching, terminating in a heart-shaped motif formed from two stitches. The cuff is finished with a strip of very narrow white leather. 

The glove is wrist length and without a fastening which was the fashion at the time. Gloves were designed to be close fitting, and the signs of wear over the knuckles and at the finger ends of this glove show that it has been well used.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The sides are turned under and stitched. The upper edge is also turned under and stitched; the lower edge has 3 cm without weft and then a 2 cm band of plain weave, thus forming the loom-end of a length. This cover is made from three pieces joined together before being embroidered: two strips about 9.5 cm wide have been added, one along each side.  This can only be clearly seen along the lower edge.
There is a circle in the middle and slightly more than half of this motif has been repeated half way down each of the four sides. In each corner is a long diagonally place boteh. The circles contain a central eight-pointed star.  At each point there is a white outlined boteh and in each indentation there is a cypress tree. These are all enclosed in a frame forming points against the circular edge. Between the points is a green alternating with light blue roundel, which probably represents a carnation. The botehs are long with a long curling tip; alternate ones face left. Each contains a small cypress tree and two pairs of botehs. The most dominant feature is a stem which starts below the boteh, lies along its centre and then splits, curves up and out and down and terminates in a green round carnation. There is a border along all four sides: small vertical cypress trees with leaning botehs either side. There is no definite upper edge to this border pattern - it seems to end suddenly and rather discordantly. 
There is a narrow outer border edging in white, consisting of a meander with orange and red carnations and blue 6-petalled flowers.
Occasionally some under drawing can be seen. There are places on the ground that have been dyed purple and this is part of the pattern, creating areas of purple in the design.

Their purpose was to provide the inexperienced needlewoman with a practical guide for stitches and motifs while giving her the opportunity to practise them.  Once completed on a long strip of linen the sampler would be rolled up and kept for future reference.

However, during the eighteenth century this practical exercise was combined with another purpose.  As the shape of the sampler changed from a strip to a rectangle so its form changed from what was essentially a practise sheet to a carefully planned pictorial composition arranged symmetrically within a border.  By the time this example was stitched in 1810 this was the standard format.  It was also common to include quotations from religious or literary sources, usually with a moralising overtone.  Some of the subjects depicted in this sampler, such as the stags and insects, can be found in other samplers elsewhere and may have been derived from a common published source or teacher.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Two pieces of fabric have been sewn together before being embroidered. A dark brown ground with a central octagon is surrounded by four blue ground elongated hexagons and four red ground lobed medallions. Blue and yellow curved hooks come from the octagons, as do green or white curled leaves. Blue and yellow curved hooks come from the lobed medallions. The octagons contain a green and yellow 'five-fingered' motif, which may simply be a leaf or may be a version of 'the hand of Fatima' motif. The motifs are outlined with a border of brown and white or red, brown and white cross stitch. There are mistakes in the design: the octagon at the centre bottom has two sides parallel instead of converging and the octagon at the top has two sides going out instead of converging. In the lower left hand corner the blue hexagon is vertical instead of horizontal.
The border has a yellow ground with a brown leafy meander linking blue and red octagonal motifs. The blue motifs have green 'arms' from diagonal opposite corners and the red ones have blue 'arms'. There are mistakes at the corners of the border: in the red motif in the top right hand corner the arms are not diagonally opposite; the same mistake is in a red motif at the top of the left hand border and in a red one at the bottom of the right hand border and in a blue one at the left hand side of the lower border.

The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as ‘piecing over paper’. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. The papers are usually removed once the project is complete. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples, such as this cover of squares and triangles. The work is often embellished with appliqué and embroidery to enhance the design. A bedcover that has been pieced but not wadded is often referred to as a coverlet.

This patchwork of fashionable silks was probably made to form part of a larger bed cover or screen, and was hand-pieced over paper. The tacking stitches and paper template are still intact, suggesting that the cover was never finished. Papers still visible in the reverse provide a record of reading habits at the time, including a newspaper from 1705 which records the trial of the notorious plotter, Titus Oates. 

For the embroidery, the maker has taken inspiration from many sources. Several of the silk patches have been stitched with motifs taken from popular prints and books, including Aesop's Fables.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Ornamental patchwork bed hangings and quilted bed covers reflected a household's access to a range of fashionable textiles, from colourful imported chintzes to sumptuous silk velvets. Many were bought specially, but householders also recycled textiles from other objects, a common practice given the financial and emotional investment in valuable fabrics.

This patchwork of silks and velvets would have been made as a bedcover or screen. The original design incorporates small embroidered panels, and a wide variety of plain and
patterned silks. A less technically accomplished hand has added figurative embroidery and appliqué to many of the patches after the completion of the piecing. The additional embroidery shows a wide range of popular needlework subjects, including four chinoiserie figures and a scene from Aesop’s fable ‘The Fox and the Vase’. 

No information concerning the provenance of the coverlet was available when it was acquired, but when the later lining was removed for conservation, it revealed an early eighteenth century paper template. Newspaper cuttings relating to the trial of Titus Oates and an advertisement for a proprietary medicine date the template to around 1705. Plain paper has also been used in several areas. Because paper was an expensive consumer item, it was common practice in even the wealthiest households to recycle it. Alongside the range of silks, this suggests an affluent household with access to a range of luxury consumer goods. In 1709 the Female Tatler described the exciting experience of shopping for such goods: ‘The shops are perfect gilded theatres . . . As people glance within their doors, they salute them with – Garden silks, ladies Italian silks, brocades, tissues, cloth of silver or cloth of gold, very fine mantua silks, any right Geneva velvet, English velvet, velvet embossed.’","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The front edges curve from neck to hem with skirts below the hip, set in pleats.  There is an inverted pleat on each side of the centre back opening.  There is a scalloped pocket flap on each coat front at hip level.  The sleeves, pocket flaps and cuffs are lined with oyster-coloured silk satin.  The coat is embroidered to shape with couched silver-gilt filé, purl and spangles in a floral design, around the front neck, down each front, on the pocket flaps and around the pockets, around the back vent, on the side edge of the front skirts, on the cuffs and part of the oyster cuff lining.  There are 13 passementerie buttons, worked in silver-gilt foil, purl and filé, on the right front edge from neck to pocket flap.  There are 4 buttons on each cuff, one above the side pleats, 3 below each pocket flap, one holding them at the hem (left side only) and 2 on the side edges of the back skirts.

The waistcoat fronts are made from the figured silk velvet.  It has a round neck, bound with a narrow strip of velvet.  The waistcoat fronts curve from neck to hem, reaching to about mid-thigh, with skirts below the hip.  There is a scalloped pocket flap on each front at hip level.  The pockets are lined with linen, the waistcoat fronts and pocket flaps with oyster-coloured silk satin.  The waistcoat is embroidered to shape with couched silver-gilt filé, purl and spanges in the same design as the coat, around the front neck, down the fronts and across the hem, around the pockets and on the pocket flaps.

The coat and waistcoat were altered in the late 19th century, for either theatrical wear or fancy dress.  The fronts and back of the coat were relined in cream silk satin, and the pleats reconfigured.  The cuffs may have been adjusted to lengthen the sleeves.  The waistcoat back was replaced with one made of ribbed red silk, lined with off-white ribbed silk, open down the back seam, with cotton-tape ties.

The growth of the sleeve was balanced by an increase in the size of the skirt. In about 1892, flared skirts were introduced. They grew to their widest extent in about 1895, along with the sleeve, and had names such as 'the bell', 'the fan' and 'the umbrella skirt'.

Cotton, embroidered with silk floss, metal-wrapped thread and metal-strips
Mughal
Late 18th century

An angarkha (from a Sanskrit term meaning ‘body protector’) is a type of robe characterised by an insert panel over the chest. This young man’s angarkha is embroidered with a style of floral motif popular during the late Mughal era. Its floor-length skirt dates it to the late 18th century, when the fashion was for much longer robes than the knee-length of earlier decades. [01/08/2017]

Above are two standing male figures each with a bow and arrow in his right hand. Above this are four seated male figures: that on the left  has a sword in a scabbard, in the centre is a servant who seems to have only one arm, then a cross-legged figure, and finally, on the right, another seemingly one-armed servant holding a bowl of sweets or fruit.

Many were solely decorative, to display the wealth and status of their owner. They were worn in the hat or belt, as well as carried in the hand. In combat, a glove was thrown down as a gage, or challenge.

Ornately embroidered gloves served official purposes, signifying the holding of a civic office or membership in the local freemanry. Gloves were popular as gifts, particularly as a New Year’s gift to the monarch and they were frequently given as a sign of royal favour.    Recent studies of the marriage ceremony in late Tudor and early Jacobean England show that accessories, particularly gloves were frequently exchanged between men and women.  This may explain why so many survive in museum collections.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

They were embroidered in about 1425, probably to be applied to an altar hanging, but were subsequently cut off and reapplied to red silk velvet, which is of a later date. This was a common practise. Expensive ecclesiastical embroidery was often reused, or a vestment or hanging might be cut up to suit changing church fashion. The scale of the figures indicates that the scene came from a sizeable hanging rather than from a vestment and would have been quite visible from a long distance away in a church. Stylistically the scene is late Gothic: the figures are fairly insubstantial with elaborately draped costumes and softly waving hair. It is a fine example of  later 'opus anglicanum' (Latin for 'English work'), which reached its peak between about 1250 and 1350.

A valance was a kind of pelmet round the top or base of a bed (the type of bed that had curtains that were drawn around it to keep out the cold).

A warrior and a woman are seated on either side of a rectangular framed subject. This probably shows the classical goddess Venus with her son Cupid, mourning the death of Adonis, Venus’ lover. The motifs, which include a laughing mask, birds, a vase and draperies, are in the grotesque style.

The term grotesque refers to the location of the designs, the grottos, which inspired the style, rather than to the subjects themselves. The most important of these, discovered in 1493, were parts of the celebrated Domus Aurea, the Golden House of Nero (ruled AD 54–68), in Rome. Designs of masks, draperies, vases and other motifs were found painted on walls and ceilings.

Italian artists introduced the grotesque style into France. French engravers adopted it immediately and also disseminated it in printed books. During the period 1550 to 1575 the grotesque style of ornament became the height of fashion in France. It was natural that grotesques were initially used for wall and ceiling decoration. They were then quickly adopted for tapestry wall hangings, in France as well as in Italy and Flanders. In France they were also employed for bed hangings, but for these the preferred medium was embroidery, as in this example. French inventories of the 16th century record many embroidered beds.

It is possible that the valance panel may have been part of a set made for Queen Catherine de Médicis (1519–89), or for some other member of the French court, but there is no firm evidence to back this up. The embroideries are of a very fine quality, however, and in the 19th century they were bound as an album inscribed ‘RICAMI DEI MEDICI’ (‘embroideries of the Medici’).","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Its plain design was part of the movement in fashion away from what were considered by some to be the extravagant excesses of the late eighteenth century.  The move was towards a simpler, purer style of dress and footwear that was influenced by designs from classical antiquity. 

Slippers or 'sandal shoes', continued to be worn well into the mid-century although by the 1850s they were used mainly for formal wear in black or white.  This shoe is a typical example of that style.  The thin leather sole and delicately hand-stitched satin uppers were relatively simple and cheap to produce.  They could then be customised either by the retailer or the owner with rosettes, ribbon ankle ties or other decorative embellishments.  At first glance the elaborate bow appears to be the same cream colour as the rest of the shoe.  However, upon closer inspection traces of pink are visible and it is likely that the whole bow was once pink but has since faded.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/printed_fabric"

Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples, and the work is often embellished with appliqué and embroidery.

Quilting is a method of stitching layers of material together. The layers are most commonly divided as follows:

Quilt top: The decorative layer of the quilt. If the top is pieced, it is known as a 'patchwork quilt'. 

Wadding/batting: A layer of cotton, wool, polyester, silk or other material, which adds warmth and dimension to the quilt. 

Reverse: The bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric. 

Hand-quilting is done on a frame using needles called 'betweens'. The stitches are executed with one hand; the other hand is kept underneath the quilt to feel for the needle. Small, uniform stitches (usually a 'running stitch') are taken through the three layers to form a decorative design. This bed cover has been quilted with a technique now known as 'stitch in the ditch': quilting along the seams of the patchwork to enhance the pieced design.

According to the donor, this quilt was made for Bishop's Court, a medieval manor house in Devon once used by the Bishops of Exeter and later purchased by the Earl of Bedford. In 1651, the house was bought by Peter Beavis, son of a wealthy Exeter merchant.

The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. A pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut out. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. A bedcover that has been pieced but not wadded is often referred to as a coverlet.

The complex, double-sided design of this coverlet would have been pieced over paper when it was first created. At some point in the nineteenth century, repairs have been made to some of the more fragile silks and silk velvets. It was probably at this point that whole sheets of newspaper were used as an interlining, adding strength and stability to the original coverlet.  Paper was handmade until the mid-nineteenth century and was both expensive and extremely useful.  Waste-paper was a valuable household commodity and was often kept over a long period.

Although very little was known about this coverlet when it was acquired in 1937, the papers now visible through the damaged silks provide a record of the household's reading habits. Most are taken from newspapers dating from the 1780s to 1840s, and include trial reports and racing calendars from the Leicestershire area.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

Many were bought specially, but householders also recycled textiles from other objects, a common practice given the financial and emotional investment in valuable fabrics.

Beautifully worked bed hangings and bed covers were found in both middle-class and aristocratic households, and could often be more costly than the bed that they dressed. Some were purchased from professional centres of production such as Exeter.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

As with many fashionable turban hats of this period, the fabric is pinned into place rather than being stitched. This would enable the hat to be easily reconstructed if so desired and would avoid marking an expensive silk fabric.

The turban was a popular form of fashionable headdress from the 1790s until 1820s. Inspired by interest in the classical world and exotic ideas of the East, the form and style of fashionable turban changed frequently. This tartan turban, with its emphasised front and velvet banding is typical of styles of the mid-1820s.

Traditional Scottish dress and tartan in particular, had been popularised in the late eighteenth century by the Prince of Wales, later George IV.

The classically inspired 'sandal shoes', with their square toe and throat, flat soles, rosettes and ribbon ankle ties, continued to be worn in black or white for formal wear but by the 1850s more elaborate styles began to emerge and heels came back into fashion.  

This pair with its lace 'fenelon' or tiered bow, a feature particular to the 1860s and 1870s,  is especially elaborate.  Two different types of lace have been used for the edging and the bow, and the addition of a gilt buckle set onto velvet provides a further decorative flourish.  It is not clear whether the lace and buckle were added by the manufacturer, the retailer or the owner.  However, although the satin uppers and leather covered heel appear to have been sewn neatly by machine the applied ornament has been hand-stitched rather crudely.

Chemical aniline dyes, first discovered in 1856, proved particularly successful when used on silks of the period. This lead to a move away from the cottons which had dominated the market in previous decades. By the 1860s, women across the country were acquiring fashionable silks for use in their domestic patchwork projects, including quilts, cushions, piano covers, table covers and sofa pillows, and for small articles such as theatre and work bags.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.

The figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.

Britain
1875-85

Said to have been worked on a long sea voyage, this appliqué cover depicts an A to Z of scenes, from 'Admiration' to 'Zingari' (an Italian term once used in English to refer to Gypsies). Fashionably dressed men and women engage in the various rituals of courtship. The presence of gaming motifs suggests that the imagery may have been adapted from a card game of the period.

The design motif of bunches of grapes is composed of silver-gilt domed sequins and floss silk, while the heavy borders incorporate actual strips of flattened metal.  The weight of heavy, gold embroidered edgings attached to fine cotton or silk ground fabrics has often meant that fragile courtly garments like this woman's shirt had a short life and were then discarded.  It was common practice in the Indian subcontinent, however, to recycle costly and elaborate edgings on another garment, thereby prolonging their useful lives.  The pristine condition of this shirt suggests that it was never (or very rarely) worn, and it has been preserved in the collections of the Indian Museum and then the V & A since 1855.

The shirt would have been worn over a small bodice (<i>choli</i>) in the same material, and a large, matching veil (<i>odhni</i>) would have been added over the head and shoulders. The ensemble would be completed by a full skirt, which has not survived.

The poem, published in Parma in 1581, is based on an earlier orally-transmitted retelling of the story of the capture of Jerusalem during the First Crusade of 1099.

The history of the series is a mystery.  It was purchased in Naples in 1868, but the documentation provided by Mr May, the Museum's Art Referee, to justify the acquisition is scant.  Clearly the hangings have been cut down as portions of the scenes they depict are missing, but we have no information about the original size of the embroideries or the extent of the set.  Nor do we know by or for whom they were made.

Some of the embroideries have complex borders incorporating caryatid figures and festoons of flowers with a central cartouche quoting the relevant passage from Tasso.  These borders are very similar in design to those of a set of tapestries also depicting scenes from <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> made for the Cardinal-Nephew, Pietro Ottoboni (1667-1740), by the San Michele manufactory in Rome.  Four of those tapestries are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.  The tapestries were based upon painted wall hangings commissioned by Ottoboni for his apartments in the Papal Palace in 1691.  An inventory of about 1740 indicates that there were seventeen tapestries in the series.  As the tapestries were made in the 1730s, and these hangings predate them it is tempting to speculate that these embroideries are also based upon the painted hangings designed for Ottoboni.

It is made using a piecing technique similar to marquetry, known as 'inlay' or 'intarsia'. Cut-out fabric shapes are inlaid into an identical cut-out space in another fabric (usually a heavy woollen cloth). They are then stitched from the reverse side, using tiny stitches that are not visible on the front. Applique has also been widely used, whereby shaped pieces of fabric are stitched on top of the ground material in order to create the design.

The central panels depict the various rituals and emotions associated with courtship, moving from ‘Admiration’ to ‘Zingari’ (an archaic term for the Romany community). These images are framed by a border that makes reference to an array of cultural figures and symbols, including fairground favourites such as Mr Punch, and gaming card motifs in the four corners. Coupled with the size of the object, these references suggest that it may have been created in relation to a card game. Textiles with playing-card motifs became particularly popular in the 1880s and ’90s. It was also common to associate love and gambling at this time. In George Eliot’s novel Daniel Deronda (1876) games of chance are played both around the gaming table and with the  heart. The gestures of the central figures on the cover also suggest the widespread appeal of melodrama. Prints, plays, novels and the music hall all helped to popularize the form and many of its associated characters.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This large silk hanging represents the 'Womb Treasury World', the mystical universal source, or 'womb', from which all things emerged. The iconography is based on the text of the Mahavairocana Sutra: At the centre of the mandala is the Buddha Vairocana, who is preaching the Dharma (the Truth upheld by the Universe) to four Buddhas and four Bodhisatvas. 

The four Buddhas might be Ratnashvaya (<i>Baosheng</i>  in Chinese, East), Amida (<i>Mituo</i> in Chinese, West), Akshobya (<i>Ajiu</i>South), and Amoghasiddhi (<i>Chengjiu</i>North) (it should be noted that these positions may vary in different mandalas). Together with Vairocana, they are known as the Five Meditation or Wisdom Buddhas.

The Boddhisatvas are possibly Samantabhadra (or Vajradhara, <i>Puxian,</i> in Chinese; South-east position), Manjusri (or <i>Wenshu</i> in Chinese; South-west), Avalokitesvara (<i>Guanyin</i> in Chinese; North-west) and Maitreya (Mi-le in Chinese, North east). 

The Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty originated from the northeast of China, and the empire extended to neighbouring Monglia and went as far as Tibet. Patronage of Buddhism in these areas was an important aspect of imperial diplomacy, and diplomatic gifts often exchanged. This mandala (embroidered on 'royal yellow'-coloured silk) was possibly presented by Mongol princes to the Yongzheng emperor for a temple under imperial patronage, and possibly one at the important pilgimage site of Wutaishan in Shanxi province.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

At the lower edge of the quilt there are split sides for ease of fitting around the post ends of a bed. The design of the quilt is near-symmetrical, with the exception of one particularly early black and pink silk that has been used only in the proper right lower corner of the cover. This silk is thought to date from the 1670s. The maker has used 5 different colours of plain silk velvet (red, green, blue, black, gold) and 1 patterned velvet (deep red/orange and black). At the head of the quilt is a Coat of Arms in silver gilt thread on a blue velvet ground, showing a rampant lion. The maker has also used a wide variety of complex weave textiles, including a green and silver thread bizarre silk dominated by a silver ground, and a blue silk with brocaded pomegranates and flowers in silver and silver gilt thread, both thought to date from the 1690s. There are yellow, pink, blue and green taffetas, and pink and yellow tissues. A brown tissue has been used extensively on the right and left borders. There is also a late 17th century yellow silk which is possibly Chinese, and a silver gilt tissue with brocaded flowers which seems to be of Persian design. Wadded with wool and lined with a green and cream striped silk, and a cream silk satin. Most of the textiles date to before 1700.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Ornamental patchwork bed hangings and quilted bed covers reflected a household's access to a range of fashionable textiles, from colourful imported chintzes to sumptuous silk velvets. Many were bought specially, but householders also recycled textiles from other objects, a common practice given the financial and emotional investment in valuable fabrics.

Beautifully worked bed hangings and bed covers were found in both middle-class and aristocratic households, and could often be more costly than the bed that they dressed. Some were purchased from professional centres of production such as Exeter.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Cut threads and stitch holes around the woman's neckline indicate missing pearls, precious stones or other original decoration.

Five scenes are shown, on a green ground depicting a young woman's experience in search of truth. Inscribed scrolls are added to each scene. The first has a young, well-born maiden, with a narrow wreath over her thick plaits, dressed in a pink overgown and ochre yellow underdress with white border, pointed shoes, is saying her prayers kneeling on the flowery green ground. The second she makes her confession of her sins to a an ecclesiastic, who is seated on  a chair, with a book upon his lap, and in a white habit and scapular. She is dressed in a brown dress. In the third, she washes her heart in blood, in a wooden table. Dressed in a pink dress, although different from the first one. The fourth has her receiving Holy Communion, clad in a blue overgown, lined with red and white underdress, and wearing a plain closely-fitting linen cap. The priest's alb is ornamented with crimson apparels on its cuffs and lower front hem. The altar has a small rod or crucifix with S. Mary and S. John, two candlesticks, having prickets for the wax lights, the outspread corporal cloth, upon which stands the chalice, and under which, in front, lies the paten somewhat hidden. Some of the inscription in the scroll is lost. In the fifth, she enters a nunnery, just outside of which stands its lady-abbess, clothed in a white habit, black hood, and white linen wimple about her throat.

Possibly Exeter
1690-1720

This quilt is said to have been made for Bishop's Court, a medieval palace in Devon once used by the Bishops of Exeter and later purchased by the Earl of Bedford. In 1651 the house was bought by Peter Beavis, son of a wealthy Exeter merchant. The rampant lion, made by a heraldic embroiderer, is from the Bedford arms, and its inclusion at the head of this quilt seems deliberately to affiliate the Beavis family with the former owners.

Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples, and the work is often embellished with appliqué and embroidery.

Quilting is a method of stitching layers of material together. The layers are most commonly divided as follows:

Quilt top: The decorative layer of the quilt. If the top is pieced, it is known as a 'patchwork quilt'. 

Wadding/batting: A layer of cotton, wool, polyester, silk or other material, which adds warmth and dimension to the quilt. 

Reverse: The bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric. 

Hand-quilting is done on a frame using needles called 'betweens'. The stitches are executed with one hand; the other hand is kept underneath the quilt to feel for the needle. Small, uniform stitches (usually a 'running stitch') are taken through the three layers to form a decorative design. This bed cover has been quilted with a technique now known as 'stitch in the ditch': quilting along the seams of the patchwork to enhance the pieced design.

According to the donor, this quilt was made for Bishop's Court, a medieval manor house in Devon once used by the Bishops of Exeter and later purchased by the Earl of Bedford.

Animal Pelt Designs
Pairs of wavy lines and groups of three large dots represent the pelts of the striped tiger and spotted leopard. In the Islamic world, the designs acquired powerful associations. The Iranian hero Rustam, for example, is usually depicted wearing a tiger-skin coat. 

By 1500, these designs were popular on Ottoman Turkish textiles, and were often combined. They soon appeared in other media, such as tilework. 

The triple-dot design has been confused with the Buddhist ‘precious jewel’ motif (Sanskrit cintamani), which is sometimes shown in groups of three. But there is no connection.

Nightcap and coif
About 1610; 1600

Men wore nightcaps when relaxing at home, in contrast to more formal headwear worn for public business during the day. The informal head covering for women was the coif. For the wealthy, these could be highly decorated with expensive metal thread and are of great beauty.

The thriving trade between the Mongolian Empire and Europe throughout the 14th century brought large quantities of Chinese luxury goods to northern Italy. Chinese silks influenced Italian textile design, particularly in Lucca and Venice. In this piece the rosettes surrounded by cloud-like ribbons with two tiny pomegranate buds at the ends closely resemble the cloud-like motifs, from the Han Dynasty.

The Visconti and Sforza dynasties (of 15th and 16th-century Milan) often used clouds with other devices, such as the Dog, the Axe, or the Rainbow. The inifinite knot motif was popular throughout the Po Valley in the second half of the 15th century, and appears in many illuminated manuscripts from Lombardy.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

Above the waist, pleated bodices, wide necklines, balloon-like sleeves and intricate hairstyles were topped off with striking bonnets such as this example in the V&A's collection.

This hat is made from a base of straw plait, carefully stitched together to form the high crown and dramatic brim. The straw has been covered entirely with velvet and subsequently decorated with wide silk satin ribbons which have been carefully pinned into place. The ends of the ribbons have then been cut into a zigzag finish. 

Bonnet trimmings were constantly changed and updated in order to give a new look, and as such ribbons and trimmings are often pinned into place as opposed to being sewn, especially on a fabric such as velvet which would mark easily.

Until the mid-nineteenth century, black dye was often created from wood components and was notoriously unstable, often fading to a brown or purple shade. The velvet on this bonnet has faded softly to a dark brown but the ribbons retain their colour.  

The 'Merry Widow' cap designed by milliner Stephen Jones for his 'Albertopolis' collection, Autumn/Winter 2009 was directly inspired by this bonnet.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

About 1600

Rural life was a typical subject for embroideries and tapestries. The embroidery here shows a nobleman hunting with hawks, while gardeners gather fruit and train vines in an orchard. Embroidered cushions made hard seats more comfortable before the development of fixed upholstery in the 17th century.

It was worked with a single colour of silk, usually black, but also blue, green or red, on linen.  Like many examples of blackwork, this coif is embellished with silver-gilt thread. The motifs are filled with counted-thread stitches arranged to create repeating geometric designs.  This style of blackwork is characteristic of the 16th century.  Unlike many coifs in the V&A’s collections, this example retains its original stitching at the top.

Until the end of the 17th century the coif was informal headwear for women.  Plain linen versions were worn by the working-class.  Middle-class and aristocratic women wore elaborately decorated coifs.  It would have been worn by itself indoors, or with a hat on top in public. In Western Europe it was customary for both men and women to cover their heads in public up until the 1960s. A hat was an essential part of respectable dress and, from a health perspective, head coverings were considered necessary to protect against chills and disease.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Although it is certain that this roundel would not have adorned the emperor's surcoat (the <i>gunfu</i>), as it is missing the requisite <i>shou</i> character, and solar and lunar symbols, it is not easy to say if this roundel came from the robe of the Crown Prince or the Consorts.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Francesco Sforza (1401-66) adopted it as his heraldic device along with the motto <i>Mit Zeit</i> (with time). He may have been referring to his endurance and perseverance in obtaining his political position. During his reign (1450-66) the plant was represented only by the large central flower, isolated from stems and leaves and repeated across the width of the fabric three times. The motif evolved over the following twenty years into a more naturalistic version, such as is seen on this velvet.

This pattern on an even richer, gold brocaded velvet is represented on the stomacher and sleeve of a gown worn by Bianca Maria Sforza in a potrait by De Predis. This portrait was made to commemorate her marriage to Maximilian of Austria in 1493. In this context, the pattern probably referred directly to the dynasty from which she came.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

In 1890 the German-born painter Sir Hubert Herkomer (1849-1914) was creating a house for himself, Lululaund, at Bushey in Hertfordshire.  He named the house after his second wife Lulu Griffiths. It took several years to build and more to furnish after its opening in 1894. A drawing for the house had been acquired from the American architect Henry Hobson Richardson (1838-1886), in return for a portrait.  Herkomer himself designed many of the furnishings, including this silk. His father and his uncle Johann carved  the furniture and he turned to another uncle, Anton, to weave silk for curtains and upholstery.  Anton Herkomer (1816-1901) had settled in New Hyde Park, Long Island, USA, where he became celebrated for his fine hand-weaving, much of which was exported to Europe. A newspaper article of 1896 described him as working on this project, weaving 400 yards of silk for his nephew.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

Caskets and workboxes were made and used by girls in the 17th century. The girls would decorate small panels with embroidery which would then be sent to a cabinet-maker to be made up into a box. They were often fitted with compartments for sewing and writing as well as a small mirror. Many cabinets also had secret compartments, used to store personal possessions such as jewellery or letters. The high cost of the materials, as well as the skill needed to create these caskets, means they could only have been made in wealthy households.

<b>Materials and Making</b>
Needlework and embroidery were seen as a crucial skill for women in the seventeenth century. Girls started learning needlework skills aged 6 or 7, first creating a band sampler and then moving on to more complex pieces. Embroidering panels for a workbox or casket was often the final piece in a girl’s education. Many surving seventeenth century workboxes are heavily decorated in raised work, also known as stumpwork. Unusually this workbox is not. The geometric design of the flowers is characteristic of the late seventeenth century, indicating it was made slightly after most of the workboxes which still survive which typically date to 1640-1680.

This box was embroidered by Parnell Mackett in 1692, she signed the vase on the lid with her initials and the year. A sampler also worked by Parnell in 1690, is held by the Art Institute, Chicago.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The high cost of the materials, as well as the skill needed to create these caskets, means they could only have been made in wealthy households.

<b>People</b>
The panels were worked by young girls, aged around 11 or 12, as part of their education. Girls started learning needlework skills aged 6 or 7, first creating a band sampler (see T.433-1990) and then moving on to more complex pieces such as cutwork. Embroidering the panels of a casket or for a mirror (see T.17-1955) appears to have been one of the last stages of a girl’s needlework education. These skills would be useful later in life in the management of a household.

<b>Materials & Designs</b>
Biblical, mythological and classical scenes were all popular themes for decorating caskets. While some girls may have designs their own panels, taking inspiration from sources such as illustrated bibles, it also appears to have been possible to have purchased designs, which the embroiderer could then customise by using certain colours or adding in features.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This example is said to have been made for the Chapel of the Holy Ghost in Basingstoke, Hampshire: the Sandys family’s private place of worship.

The survival of so many embroideries worked in wool or silk on linen canvas reflects the popularity of such work in the 16th and 17th centuries, when it was used extensively for furnishings. It is likely that many pieces of this type also survived because, unlike richer embroideries with metal thread, those made of less valuable materials were not dismantled.

It was probably made after the marriage of Henry Sandys to Elizabeth, daughter of William, 2nd Lord Windsor. The coat of arms is quartered, which is to say divided, to show the previous generations of both partners in the marriage. It became fashionable in the Tudor period to quarter one’s arms and show every instance of a coat of arms granted, inherited or brought to the family through marriage. These arms, with only two generations shown apiece, are relatively modest by the standards of the day.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The shapes for two jacket fronts and two sleeves  has been drawn in pen and ink on linen, with the design for their embroidery.  The linen would have been secured in a frame to hold it taut while the embroidery was done.   Once completed, the shapes would have been cut out by a tailor and sewn together. The very short waist of the jacket fronts and close-fitting shape of the sleeves suggest a date between 1619 and 1625.

Blackwork was a style of needlework popular in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.  It was worked with a single colour of silk, usually black, as on this panel,  but also sometimes blue, red or green, on linen.  The pattern of flowers, birds and insects is characteristic of embroidery of this period, inspired by herbals and other popular books on the natural world.  The style of embroidery uses speckling stitch, comprised of tiny running stitches arranged to give a shaded effect.  Blackwork in speckling stitch imitates the graphic method used in woodblock prints to create three-dimensional shapes.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when hunting for sport was an important aspect of court and aristocratic life and had a significant role in the power play between rulers and subjects, falconry was considered among the highest status of all hunting pursuits. 

Hoods were used both as an aid to training the birds and to keep the trained falcons quiet and still while sitting on the falconer's glove. Most hoods have a plume on top of the crown which, as well as being decorative, can be used as a handle to help in the removal of the closely-fitting hood.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when hunting for sport was an important aspect of court and aristocratic life and had a significant role in the power play between rulers and subjects, falconry was considered among the highest status of all hunting pursuits. 

Hoods were used both as an aid to training the birds and to keep the trained falcons quiet and still while sitting on the falconer's glove. Most hoods have a plume on top of the crown which, as well as being decorative, can be used as a handle to help in the removal of the closely-fitting hood. The equipment used for hunting provided an opportunity for extravagant display, and this example is no exception, the leather embellished with gold tooling, silk velvet and highly skilled embroidery in silver thread.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

They were long-sleeved upper garments, opening down the front and fitted at the waist using inserted gores.  Waistcoatswere worn with petticoats (skirts) and loose gowns over the top, accessorised with fine lace cuffs and ruffs or bands (collars). The tight-fitting sleeves and natural waistline of this example suggest a date between 1610 and 1620. 

While a number of embroidered linen waistcoats survive in museum collections, this is an unusual example of one made of silk.  Its embroidery pattern follows the characteristic design of this period, with scrolling stems.  However the floral motifs are quite abstract, moving away from the naturalism typical in embroidery in the late 16th and early 17th centuries.

It is worked in an embroidery technique called blackwork, with a single colour of silk, usually black, but also sometimes blue, red or, greenn on linen. Blackwork was particularly popular for dress accessories such as handkerchiefs, coifs, caps, shirts and smocks.

This is a very accomplished example of 17th-century blackwork in the speckling style.  The arrangement of tiny running stitches in black mimics the subtle shading of woodblock prints, giving a three-dimensional effect to the pattern.  The design is also very skilful in its naturalism, particularly the insects depicted.

Caskets were made and used by girls in the 17th century. The girls would decorate small panels with embroidery which would then be sent to a cabinet-maker to be made up into a casket. They were often fitted with compartments for sewing and writing as well as a small mirror. Many cabinets also had secret compartments, used to store personal possessions such as jewellery or letters. The high cost of the materials, as well as the skill needed to create these caskets, means they could only have been made in wealthy households.

<b>People</b>
The panels were worked by young girls, aged around 11 or 12, as part of their education. Girls started learning needlework skills aged 6 or 7, first creating a band sampler (see T.433-1990) and then moving on to more complex pieces such as cutwork. Embroidering the panels of a casket or for a mirror (see T.17-1955) appears to have been one of the last stage of a girl’s needlework education. These skills would be useful later in life in the management of a household.

<b>Materials &amp; Designs</b>
Biblical, mythological and classical scenes were all popular themes for decorating caskets. While some girls may have designs their own panels, taking inspiration from sources such as illustrated bibles, it also appears to have been possible to have purchased designs, which the embroiderer could then customise by using certain colours or adding in features. This casket is the largest in the V&A's collection.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The coat is embroidered to shape with appliqued velvet flowers and embroidery in coloured silks and silver purl, on the collar, down the fronts, on the side of the front skirts, the cuffs and pocket flaps, around the pockets at the back vent.  There were 10 buttons (top 2 now missing), covered with velvet and embroidered with silver purl, on the right front, with on buttonhole, cut and worked in tawny silk twist on the left front, corresponding to the 3rd button from the neck.  There are 3 buttons below the pocket flaps, 3 on the cuffs, one above the side pleats and one holding them at the hem.  

The coat has been altered in the late 19th century or early 20th century for wear in the theatre or as a studio prop.  The lining has been patched and replaced in areas with lining and white silk satin.  The pleats have been unstitched.  The lining of the sleeves has been taken out, the cuffs removed, inverted and lengthened and reattached.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The coat has a round neckline with a narrow stand collar.  The shaped, two-piece sleeves reach to between wrist and elbow, with round cuffs (13.5 cm at top, 15.5 cm at bottom).  The coat fronts curve from neck to hem with wide skirts below the hip, arranged in pleats (24 cm deep), two in front and one at the back.  There is an inverted pleat on each side of the centre back opening.  There is a scalloped pocket flap on each coat front at hip level.  The coat is lined with white silk satin.  The edges of the fronts and the back opening are interlined.  There are 20 passementerie buttons, of silver-gilt strip and thread, on the right front, with 20 buttonholes, worked in turquoise-blue silk, on the left front.  

The breeches are made of the silk velvet, cut in two back legs, two front legs and two waistbands.  The back is higher than the front, with the fullness gathered into the waistbands.  There are 6 pockets, 2 on each front with a pocket flap, two in the front of each waistband, and one in each side seam.  The pockets are lined with chamois, the waistbands with linen.  There is no fall front, the breeches fasten with 2 large, velvet-covered buttons on the right waistband with corresponding buttonholes on the left waistband, and 3 small, velvet covered buttons on the right front leg, with 3 buttonholes on a strip of velvet sewn to the left front leg.  All 6 pockets have a small button and buttonhole.  The legs fasten on the outside above the knee with 5 buttons on the back legs and 5 buttonholes on the front legs. There are buckle bands at the bottom of each leg and on the waistbands at centre back.

The suit probably once had a matching waistcoat.  It was probably worn in the theatre in the 19th century.  A broad facing of linen has been added to the coat fronts, with no openings for the buttonholes.  There are three stamps on the lining of the back left below the neckline of the coat and on the waistband of the breeches.  The breeches were probably lined with the same white silk satin, and was removed when it wore out, leaving only a remnant under the buttons of the legs and left front.  The breeches were made larger by opening the centre back seam and inserting a triangle of black velvet, and the right back buckle band extended with a strip of black velvet.  Two strips of coarse green linen were sewn to the waistband on either side.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The embroidery edges the fronts, around the pockets, the pocket flaps, the cuffs and back opening of the skirts.  Silver spangles decorate the red velvet ground.

The coat appears to have been heavily altered in the late 19th century, probably for theatrical use.  The original embroidered-to-shape standing collar was removed and an extra piece (all additions were possibly from a waistcoat of the same fabric and embroidery) added, and the collar reversed and resewn to make a flat collar.  The cuffs were detached and narrowed, the sleeve lengthened, and the cuffs resewn.  The coat was lengthened at the hem with additional pieces of the velvet and embroidery, and the skirts narrowed.

The coat fronts curve from neck to hem, with skirts below the hip arranged in pleats at the sides.  There is scalloped pocket flap on each front at hip level.  The pockets are lined with linen, and the pocket flaps with cream silk satin.  The coat fronts, cuff and pocket flaps are interlined, probably with buckram.  The edges of the coat fronts are embroidered with strips of parchment wrapped with silk to resemble a string of white beads alternating with smaller black ones.  Inside this line of embroidery is a wide border embroidered in coloured flowers entwined with  black and white 'necklace'.  The same border edges the cuffs, the collar, the pocket flaps and pockets, the coat front at the side openings and the back vent.

The coat may have been worn in the theatre in the 19th century.  The buttonholes have been sewn up, the coat relined with white silk taffeta and none of the buttonholes cut in the lining.

The shaped, two-piece sleeves are moderately loose, ending between wrist and elbow with deep round cuffs (17.5 cm at the top, 19.5 at the bottom).  The front edges curve slightly from neck to chest, then run straight to the hem, following the vertical line of the woven border.

The waistcoat has two fronts of the woven-to-shape velvet, with wide skirts below the waist. The front edges curve slightly from neck to chest and straight to the waist, where a fish (dart) from pocket to side seam angles the front edges of the skirts.  There are 9 buttonholes on the left front.  

The breeches are made from the ground pattern of the velvet, without any border design.  They are cut in two fronts, two backs and a two-piece waistband.  The backs are higher than the fronts, with the back fullness gathered into the waistbands.

The waistcoat back of pink ribbed silk and pink woollen twill are replacements, which have later been widened for a larger wearer.

Until the end of the 17th century the coif was informal headwear for women.  Plain linen versions were worn by the working-class.  Middle-class and aristocratic women wore elaborately decorated coifs.  It would have been worn by itself indoors, or with a hat on top in public. In Western Europe it was customary for both men and women to cover their heads in public up until the 1960s.

It was worked with a single colour of silk, usually black, but also blue, green or red, on linen.   Now only a few tiny shreds of the black silk embroidery thread remain.  The use of iron in the dyeing process (to fix and enhance the black) and exposure to light have caused the threads to disintegrate.  

The loss of thread has exposed the original embroidery design, hand-drawn in blue ink.  The pattern consists of a variety of single motifs of flowers, birds and insects, very similar to those reproduced in embroidery pattern books of the early 17th century.  These motifs were transferred to the linen by pricking the outline of the design on paper, pouncing (dusting with fine dark powder), then joining the dots left on the linen with a fine brush and ink.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

It was made from long rectangular strips of silk net individually embroidered with appliqué floral motifs, which have then been joined together with narrow machine-made braid. The embroidery technique, using tiny pieces of semi-sheer cotton lawn, is called Carrickmacross work, and was first developed in the early nineteenth century.

When Betsy and William’s daughter donated the skirt to the V&A she told us that her grandmother, Betsy’s mother, made it. Whilst the skirt is very beautifully done, the strips of net are of slightly uneven widths and the appliqué work down each strip is not always perfectly centred. The randomness of the pattern and some tiny flaws in its laying-out are also signs that it is not by a professional embroiderer. The variety of floral motifs in the embroidery, including at least nine distinct flowers, is notable. The family story was that the skirt was made before Betsy knew who she would marry, so her mother embroidered English roses, Irish shamrocks and Scottish thistles into it in case Betsy’s husband came from outside Wales.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/tabby"

She later became known as the pious woman who pitied Jesus as he bore the cross to Golgotha, and so soothed him by wiping his face with a napkin, or her veil. The image of his face is said to have become miraculously imprinted upon the cloth. The Sudarium, or Veil of Veronica, as it came to be known, became one of the most important relics in the Catholic world. Today, there are at least six relics which claim to be the veil of St. Veronica.

The burse is an important liturgical textile, and is a sort of pouch used to store the corporal, a square white linen cloth which lays beneath the chalice and paten during Mass. Whereas the corporal cannot be richly decorated, there are no such rules regarding the burse. The deployment of this particular saintly figure as a decorative motif is not uncommon. St. Veronica's supposed personal modesty and compassion held obvious appeal for the church, and the tantalising notion of a relic which was not just attributed to Christ, but which also showed an image of his face, is appropriate given that Mass itself provides contact with the body of Christ.

Rich textiles such as this were a very visible method of promoting the glory of Christ, and could be equally beneficial to the patrons whose money was spent in their commission or purchase.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances

Small parasols such as this example were designed for open carriage rides which were hugely popular in the middle of the nineteenth century. A folding hinge, held upright by a sliding metal tube when open, meant the parasol could be reduced to half its size when not in use. Carriage parasols were often elaborate in design as their small size meant manufacturers could display their very best in labour and materials. They were also key in the display of wealth and taste, the very possession of one implying ownership of a carriage. This is a typical example of the 1850s, with a thin carved ivory stick and embroidered cover which had become common place, The Ladies Cabinet reporting in 1850 'There is a profusion of embroideries on all materials this year.'","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Bed valances
1580–1600

Sets of bed hangings created an enclosed, private space within the bedrooms of palaces and grand houses. They were a focal point for luxurious decoration. The horizontal form of valances suited narratives that continued around the bed. These four valances show scenes of courtly life and stories from classical literature.

BED VALANCES
1580-1600

Valances were borders around the top of an Elizabethan bed. Their horizontal form created a frieze for narratives that were embroidered or woven. This pair shows two scenes from the myth of Adonis. One features his conception, resulting from the incestuous affair between Myrrah and Cinyras. The other shows his death while hunting.

Usually, it was a profession of loyalty to, or a symbol of patronage from, a particular monarch. The initials which surround the armorial are probably those of the family who owned the pouch.

This pouch probably contained sweet-smelling herbs, which were thought to help induce sleep. Pleasant scents were also believed to help to ward off sickness, with a prime example of the use of this theory being the ‘beak’ masks worn by plague doctors from at least the seventeenth-century.

The richness of the materials used in the object’s production suggest a wealthy source, and the somewhat naïve execution of the design points to an amateur craftsperson, possibly a child, as its maker. This would not have been unusual, as even aristocratic girls were expected to learn needlework as a means of education, instilling discipline, and as a means of expression.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The gown is open at the front with shaped, elbow-length sleeves.  The bodice meets at centre front.  The bodice and skirt are cut separately and stitched together at the waist.  The back is made of 4 shaped pieces, tapering to a point at centre back below the waist.  The bodice fronts and side back pieces, and centre back pieces are lined separately with linen, and stitched together; the  sleeeves are also lined with linen.  Stitching forms a casing for a bone from waist to mid-back at the centre back.  Stitching in the front bodice lining below the neckline forms a casing for narrow linen tape drawstrings.  The skirt is made of 5 widths of silk, finely flat-pleated into the waist.  

The gown may have originally been made with a petticoat.  The gown skirt is heavily pieced; it was possibly made over from an earlier gown, or the skirt replaced with parts from the petticoat.  There are 9 remaining pieces; Part F is a short-waisted bodice front and back, Parts B and C are elbow-length sleeves.

In the late 19th century, the gown was altered for fancy dress.  Boning was added to the bodice fronts, along with hooks and thread bars for fastening.  The four linen tapes at the waist and four on the skirt, for looping it up, were probably added at this time.  A triangular gore of silk has been unpicked from each skirt front.

Yazd, Iran
About 1840–70

Like other religious minorities in Iran, Zoroastrians were required to  dress to identify their religion. They wore brightly coloured clothing and  did not usually veil their faces. This created an obvious contrast with the  outdoor clothing worn by Muslim women. A Zoroastrian woman would  typically wear a tunic (qamis), together with loose trousers (shalvar)  gathered at the ankle. These trousers were made from textile remnants  because there were restrictions on Zoroastrians buying full widths of  fabric. Women covered their heads with a small fitted cap (lachak), over  which they would wrap several shawls around their head and  shoulders.

This pouch may have contained sweet-smelling herbs thought to help induce sleep and ward off sickness. It shows the Tudor arms with the English lion and Welsh dragon as supporters. The initials 'E.R.' are for Elizabeth Regina (Queen Elizabeth I). The other initials are probably those of the family who owned it.

Embroidery with Charles I
About 1650–60

This embroidery of Charles I is taken from a pamphlet sold in London shortly after his execution in 1649. The pamphlet, Eikon Basilike [Image of the King]: The Poutraicture of His Sacred Maiestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings, said to have been written by the king himself, was an effective piece of Royalist propaganda. The image was reproduced in many forms, but the embroidered version is very rare.

The pendant leaves were deliberately hung loosely from their mounts, so that they flickered when worn, reflecting the light and making a noise like bells.  This was intended to deflect any potential evil from the bride, and demonstrates the survival of a belief dating back to medieval times.

It was given to the museum in 1908, together with some other Dalmatian traditional jewellery, by Aymer Vallance, a leading member of the Oxford Movement in the 19th century, and a supporter of William Morris’ Arts and Crafts.  It was originally described as a Norwegian belt, probably due to the numerous leaf-shaped pendants.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The <i>kalaga</i> was acquired by the Museum in 1855, and all the characters are elegantly dressed in the court style of the first half of the 19th century.

To this is hand stitched the blue border - W. 36 cm. Made of unbroken lengths mitred at the corners. Decorated with eighteen fabulous lion like creatures similar to the Chinese ""qilin"" (each 24 cm x H 20 cm. framed with recurring tendrils, leaves and flowers. The beasts represent the four species of mythological lions, such as the herbivore and bull-like ""tena"", the omnivorous ""kala"", also bull-like, the fawn coloured ""pandu"", and ""katheraza"", the king amongst them, each beast is different in design and colour. While some are shown with a thin black mane, others sport a mixture of red and white stripes. The snarling lions prance and clutch at the scrolling vegetation. 

The subject in the central field is taken from the Ramakien (Ramayana). The lively figures are arranged in two registers in the red central rectangle, and with the action contained within five panels. At the top are alternating pairs of armed ""myauk"" (monkeys) and ""belu"" (demons) locked in single combat. At the end, on the right, is Indragit riding his ""tein-yett-htar"" (cloud-chariot). Although he is usually depicted throwing ""nagapat-kyawkwin"" (serpent lassoes in the form of naga-dragons; another version calls them serpent darts) in this interpretation he is holding a swirling scarf, which presumably transforms itself into these deadly instruments of death. In the bottom left register is Rama (identifiable by his green-coloured face), who, guided by (Phiphek? Thai version) the astrologer brother of Ravanna who had come over to his side, aims an arrow at a flying demon threatening the pair. Beyond them is the white monkey Hanuman, engaged in a fight with a demon. He aims a globe-like weapon at his apponent crouching at his feet. Besides them, a striped snake emerges from a hollow tree and looks on. Lethana (Lakshmana) the younger brother of Rama, recognizable by his golden face, is aided by a monkey in shooting an arrow at Indrajit, who is an adept at using a magic mirror to hide in the clouds and ambush his victims by burning them with its rays. Beyond a rocky outcrop of Chinese design, a monkey and a demon fight. Small striped birds flutter amidst all this frenetic activity.

These fragments of floral dress fabric came from the textile stores of the Nizams of Hyderabad. The first Nizam was the Mughal governor of Hyderabad, and Mughal styles heavily influenced Hyderabad’s court culture. The Nizams ruled Hyderabad independently from 1724 to 1948. In that time they amassed one of the richest textile collections in the world.

Many figurative textiles tell stories. The climax of the epic poem Mahabharata is the battle shown here, between the Pandavas and the Kauravas. Leading the Pandava army is Arjuna, seen in the centre in a chariot, aiming his bow. His charioteer is the Hindu god Krishna, who has come to the Pandavas' aid.

1931 Description: the scarf is woven with a tinted silk warp of brown silk, with narrow stripes of tinted warp weaving in black, fawn and white. At each side is a broad band of tinted warp weaving in red, white, green, blue and yellow. The ends are finished with a knotted silk fringe.

1975 Description: Perraje Jaspeado (Tie Dyed Shawl). Jaspe is the Indian term for tie-dyed yarns. There are several different ways of wrapping the perrajes around the body and it is also common to see them folded and used on the women's heads as hats. The warp fringe is braided. It is a warp-faced weave; the weft which is not visible is white.

Notes (1997): 
Warp: silk with a slight z-twist; 180 threads per inch. The main part of the fabric is decorated with two types of stripes:
(1) black, white and cream warp ikat
(2) light brown containing two narrow yellow stripes
To either side there is a coloured border.  From the centre outwards this is:
(1) light red, dark red, white, dark red, light red.
(2) warp ikat in white, red, yellow, green and blue.
(3) as (1)
(4) as (2) but slightly more than double the width of the pattern.
(5) as (1)
(6) as (2)
(7) as (1)
Weft: white silk; 43 threads per inch.
There is a plaited fringe at either end. An amateur attempt has been made to create a diamond shaped net effect by threading one plait through another. This is most extensive at the sides where the coloured warp threads are.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/resist_dyeing"

Its maker, Jane Bostocke, who is known to have been a cousin of Alice's and was buried in the village where she lived, may have lived in the Lee family household. The motifs at the top of the sampler relate to their family crests. The sampler is from a period of transition in the practical use of such items - between the 16th century and earlier, when they served as a reference piece for a more or less experienced embroiderer, and what gradually became their nature in the 17th century: a method of measuring and recording the maker's skill.

The embroidery is worked in cross stitch and back stitch but there are examples of work in more complicated stitches showing that the back stitch was intended to be a grounding for further elaboration.  Other stitches include satin, chain, ladder, buttonhole and detached buttonhole filling, couching in patterns, coral, speckling, two-side Italian cross, bullion and French knots and beadwork.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

In the area above the inscription are the following motifs: an owl in a tree, a dog with collar and lead, a lion passant guardant, a chained and muzzled bear in a field of daisies, a tree with a squirrel and a pelican in her piety, a crouching hind, a spray of cowslips and a small dog with 'IVNO' above it. There are also three small motifs that have been unpicked, which appear to be a castle on an elephant, a squirrel cracking a nut, and a raven. All of these motifs are worked in cross stitch except for the large dog which is filled in with closely worked arrowhead stitch. There are also two tiny examples of metal thread interlacing in the top right corner. The rest of the sampler is filled with formal geometrical and floral repeating patterns. These are worked mainly in back stitch, but there are examples of work in more complicated stitches showing that the back stitch was intended to be a grounding for further elaboration. Other stitches include satin, chain, ladder, buttonhole and detached buttonhole filling, couching in patterns, coral, speckling, two-side Italian cross, bullion and French knots and beadwork.

1931 Description: cover, coloured silks on brown cotton; satin and double running stitches. The cover is in two pieces, stitched together across the centre.  At either end is a broad band of embroidery in crimson and blue-green silks, the pattern consisting of symmetrically arranged conventional flowers and leaves.  Above this band at either end are three turkeys, seen from the front, in the same colours, and above these two butterflies; along one side is a narrow crocheted border in the coloured silks, and at either end is a fringe of green silk and cotton.

1975 Description: The ground cloth is a balanced weave and probably is made of the natural brown, undyed, cotton known as Cuyuscate or Ixcaco (Gossypium Mexcianum) so valued and popular in Guatemala among the Indians.  This piece is not typical of Guatemalan Indian work but was probably embroidered by Guatemalans for the Spanish colonists.  Silk embroidery on Cuyuscate is mentioned by Osborne in relation to the village of Totonicapan; perhaps this piece is from there as this was also a colonial centre. See L de J Osborne 'Indian Crafts of Guatemalan and San Salvador' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1965 p.149).  On pp.96-97 there is a reference to the peacock and to green silk and turtle motifs.

Notes (1997): The ground is a loose plain weave with brown (undyed) cotton (Z-spun, unplied).  There are 44 warp threads per inch and 34 weft threads per inch.  Both ends are oversewn with red silk; neither seems to have been turned as a hem but both seem thicker and stronger than the ground.  The embroidery (which is reversible) is worked with red and blue (or blue/green?) floss silk.  The same type and colour of silk has been used to make a narrow bobbin lace edging which has been attached to one side.  Lengths of plaited brown and blue silk (4.5"" long) have been attached to both ends to form a fringe.  The join across the middle of this piece is very crude and gives the impression that the piece was originally a deep border made from two widths joined side by side.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

SILVER AND GOLD

For lavish decoration, embroiderers use thin strips of silver or gilded silver (zari), sequins and metal foil, often with tiny pearls. Yarn made of silk thread wrapped with silver (or gilded silver) can be woven or used for embroidery. Metal strips interwoven with silk produce luxurious shiny fabric or ribbon (gota) which can be applied onto cloth.

From the studio of Richard Cosway
About 1755
This chair appears in several portraits painted by Richard Cosway (1742-1821).  It epitomises the Rococo style in English furniture.  It matches an undated drawing by the carver and designer Matthias Lock. The outlines of the chair are entirely composed of curves and the legs show the fashionable, curving 'cabriole' form with naturalistically carved paw feet.
Lime and pine, carved and gilded, modern silk damask upholstery
Designed and made in London by Matthias Lock (born in London, about 1710, died there in 1765)
Bought with the aid of funds from the Brigadier Clark Bequest
Museum no. W.1-1973 [01/09/2001]
ARMCHAIR 
ENGLISH; about 1760
Carved and gilt wood

Designed and carved by Matthias Lock (d.1765).  This chair was at one time in the possession of the artist Richard Cosway (d.1821) and appears in three of his portraits. [pre October 2000]
This chair appears in a portrait attributed to Richard Cosway, of Elizabeth Draper (1744-1778), better known as Stern's 'Immortal Eliza'. It is one of the finest known examples of the type known as 'French chairs', designs for which were published in Chippendale's <font -u>Gentleman and Cabinetmaker's Director</font>. [pre 1980]
A highly important carved and gilt-wood rococo open armhair of asymtetrical form; the cabriole legs with hary paw feet in front and volutes at the rear, the cartouche shaped back, arms and seat rails excellently carved with acanthus scrolls, C scrolls and flame ornaments.  English, circa 1760
Note:
This chair is stylistically very close to some of the so-called 'French Chairs' in Chippendale's 'Director' drawing book.  The carver, in this case, has used limewood for the back and arms and pine for the legs and seat rails.  The extremely high quality of the carving and the subtlety and sophistication of the design certainly does not preclude a possible attribution to the workshop of Thomas Chippendale.  There is, however, no positive evidence to support this. [pre 1990]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/damask"

"http://data.silknow.org/object/b918334a-5262-3daf-841e-bd2f0fff86bc","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","The interest in this chair lies not just in its fashionable Rococo appearance, but in its later use as a prop by the artist Richard Cosway (1742-1821).  It was probably made in the 1750s, when such chairs were the height of fashion.  Cosway probably bought the chair second-hand in about 1770. He used the chair in several paintings. 

The chair was used as a prop for the painting 'Charles Townley with a group of connoisseurs', 1771-1775, now in Towneley Hall Art Gallery and Museums, Burnely.

A sitter in another Cosway portrait showing the chair is Elizabeth - or Eliza - Draper (1744-1778), best known for her friendship with the British author Laurence Sterne (1713-1768). Mrs Draper lived in India for most of her life, and met Sterne in 1767, when she was visiting England. Sterne mentioned Mrs Draper in ‘A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy’ published in 1768.  He also wrote a ‘Journal to Eliza’ which was published long after his death.  Mrs Draper again visited England in the mid-1770s, when Cosway painted her sitting in this chair. 

The chair has been covered in modern silk damask (2001), copying the upholstery which is visible in Draper portrait. The stuffing gives rounded profiles to the seat, back and arms.

A pencil drawing in the V&amp;A collection (Museum no.2848:149) by Matthias Lock (ca. 1710-1765) appears to be the design for this chair. Lock, as well as designing and making his own furniture, also supplied some of the furniture designs for Thomas Chippendale's book ‘The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director’, published in 1754.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/damask"

Central Europe, 18th century
This delicate kerchief was acquired by the Museum partly because it is an exceptional example of a technique and quality not previously well-represented in the Collection, but primarily for the complexity of its design.  What appears to be a pretty embroidery is, in fact, a superbly designed example of functional art.
the fine silk has been embroidered with a double-faced or reversible pattern of individual plants and a narrow scrolling border.  There are seven motifs along each side, with a small branch of fruit alternating with a flower.  Two of the larger corner motifs are identical and the four borders form two identical pairs: down the left and along the bottom are single blossoms alternating with fruit, while along the top and down the right are floral sprigs bearing several flowers.
The kerchief would have been folded along a diagonal line to form a trianglar scarf and could be folded to create three different effects:
(i) with a crown imperial at the lower corner and one border of each type;
(ii) with the pomegrante in the lower corner and identical borders of deep colours;
(iii) with the red currrants and wild hyacinth in the lower corner and identical borders in which the predominant colours are light blue and yellow.
Such deliberate versatility is the hallmark of a high quality and expensive dress accessory in any age and culture.

At least eleven of the seventeen fruits and flowers depicted were introduced into Europe from or through the Ottoman Empire.  The plants have been copied from botanical drawings and were not drawn from life - flowers and fruit seldom appear together on the stem. The source of these designs would most probably have been a series of scientific studies published in Central Europe in the middle of the 18th cnetury.  However, the emrboidery technique is not European.  The stitch used is one of the most characteristic Turkish embroidery stitches: in English it is called double darning and in Turkish 'pesent'. Because the needle goes over the same row twice, both sides of the work are identical.
As the fine silk ground is completely transparent, the designer did not intend the kerchief to be folded exactly in half to form a triangle.  If it were, both the border on the top and that underneath would be visible - one directly on top of the other - the lines and the colours would intermingle and become blurred and it would be impossible to see or appreciate the design.  If, instead, the kerchief is folded slightly off centre, it is possible to see two borders in perfect detail, one above the other - doubling the effect of pattern and colour.  A transparent silk ground and the Turkish stitch 'pesent' were deliberately selected in order to create this visually stunning and versatile accessory.

Along all four sides there is a 2 cm deep border of scrolling stems bearing flowers, fruits and berries. Above this there is a 12 cm deep border of isolated floral or fruit sprigs arranged so that the kerchief can be folded diagonally to reveal different design and colour combinations. Square but designed to be folded and worn as a triangle.

The kerchief could be folded to create three different effects:

The fine silk has been skilfully embroidered with a reversible pattern of individual plants. At least eleven of the seventeen fruits and flowers depicted were introduced into Europe from or through the Ottoman Empire.  The plants have been copied from botanical drawings, and the source of these designs would probably have been a series of scientific studies published in Central Europe in the middle of the 18th century.  
However, the embroidery technique is not European.  The stitch used is one of the most characteristic Turkish embroidery stitches, known in English as double darning and in as Turkish 'pesent'. Because the needle goes over the same row twice, both sides of the work are identical. As the fine silk ground is completely transparent, the kerchief needs to be folded slightly off centre. Then it is possible to see two borders in perfect detail, doubling the effect of pattern and colour.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The embroideries required less costly materials (mainly linen and silk thread) and women could make them in their own homes. Large panels served as quilt-covers and hangings. Smaller pieces were used as napkins, sashes and towels, and for wrapping one’s possessions on the way to the public bath.

This embroidered design is organised in a series of parallel wavy lines, rising through the textile. Five different flowers sprout from this trellis, rendered in red, blue and green against the cream linen background. The flowers range from relatively naturalistic blooms, such as rosebuds, to more dramatic floral stylisations.

Central Europe, 18th century
This delicate kerchief was acquired by the Museum partly because it is an exceptional example of a technique and quality not previously well-represented in the Collection, but primarily for the complexity of its design.  What appears to be a pretty embroidery is, in fact, a superbly designed example of functional art.
the fine silk has been embroidered with a double-faced or reversible pattern of individual plants and a narrow scrolling border.  There are seven motifs along each side, with a small branch of fruit alternating with a flower.  Two of the larger corner motifs are identical and the four borders form two identical pairs: down the left and along the bottom are single blossoms alternating with fruit, while along the top and down the right are floral sprigs bearing several flowers.
The kerchief would have been folded along a diagonal line to form a trianglar scarf and could be folded to create three different effects:
(i) with a crown imperial at the lower corner and one border of each type;
(ii) with the pomegrante in the lower corner and identical borders of deep colours;
(iii) with the red currrants and wild hyacinth in the lower corner and identical borders in which the predominant colours are light blue and yellow.
Such deliberate versatility is the hallmark of a high quality and expensive dress accessory in any age and culture.

At least eleven of the seventeen fruits and flowers depicted were introduced into Europe from or through the Ottoman Empire.  The plants have been copied from botanical drawings and were not drawn from life - flowers and fruit seldom appear together on the stem. The source of these designs would most probably have been a series of scientific studies published in Central Europe in the middle of the 18th cnetury.  However, the emrboidery technique is not European.  The stitch used is one of the most characteristic Turkish embroidery stitches: in English it is called double darning and in Turkish 'pesent'. Because the needle goes over the same row twice, both sides of the work are identical.
As the fine silk ground is completely transparent, the designer did not intend the kerchief to be folded exactly in half to form a triangle.  If it were, both the border on the top and that underneath would be visible - one directly on top of the other - the lines and the colours would intermingle and become blurred and it would be impossible to see or appreciate the design.  If, instead, the kerchief is folded slightly off centre, it is possible to see two borders in perfect detail, one above the other - doubling the effect of pattern and colour.  A transparent silk ground and the Turkish stitch 'pesent' were deliberately selected in order to create this visually stunning and versatile accessory.

People who visited the <i> hamman</i> (public baths) would wrap them round their bodies when they rested after bathing.

The seams have been decorated with gold-coloured metal braid - the metal thread being silver strip wound around a yellow silk core.  Similar metal braid has been applied along the edges and around the main decorative panel on the back of each sleeve. Three strips of it extend for 3 cm below the front hem, towards either side.

The front legs and arm supports are turned as columns, except for the sections where the seat rails and stretchers are jointed to them; the back legs, back uprights and the foot-level stretchers on all four sides are of rectangular section, the back with a marked rake above the seat rail. The rectangular back and seat are upholstered in red velvet, the velvet of the seat a replacement. Originally the chair would have had turned finials at the top of the back uprights, gilded and decorated to match the rest of the frame. 

The frame is painted on all visible surfaces with polychrome decoration of naturalistic English flowers (possibly anemones or roses) on a gilt-gesso ground. In several places (notably on the outer sides of the lower back uprights) the flowers are set against a background of dense gilded arabesques on a red ground, and it seems likely that this ground was originally present everywhere on the chair. The decoration is very much degraded, with much loss of surface, so reading the original scheme is not easy. The arabesque background to these areas was painted with gold powder in a varnish, over a ground that was painted with a transparent red glaze over the base gilding. The naturalistically painted flowers, which include anenomes and roses, are painted in translucent and solid colours (pinky red and a malachite-like green predominate), with black-line details. 

The rectangular seat and back, and the down-curving arms are upholstered in red silk velvet, which survives from the original scheme, although much degraded. On the back the original 21"" (54 cm) width of the velvet is visible in the vertical seams to either side. On both back and arms, the seams (sometimes re-sewn) show fragments of metal-thread trimming. The velvet on the arms has been mounted down onto new velvet. On the back, a shadow line running horizontally just above the arms, would originally have been covered by a deep fringe.Similar fringe, perhaps of different widths would also have hung from the bottom of the back, from the ege of the seat (which would have had a loose cushion, with similar trimming) and possibly from the top edge of the back. A fragment of this survives on the lining of the back, behind the PL upright and shows it to be silver thread. 

The back is lined with plain linen canvas (possibly original), showing a crease between two lines of stitching running horizontally across the middle, with two lines of stitching.  This may relate to the line of fringing that was originally mounted on the front face at this height. Red fabrics (silk and silk velvet) are visible under this on the PL side. The lower back rail is probably a later addition rather than a replacement but the top rail is replaced.  The seat is now reinforced wtih two attached battens, inside the front and back rails of the seat. These support two softwood boards running front to back, with gaps between them.  Neither the battens nor boards show on the photograph published in 1924 (see reference to Margaret Jourdain's book) but may well have been already in place. The edges of a coarse linen base cloth are visible in that photo and it may be the base cloth that currently sits above the softwood boards, supported on two lateral, plain-weave lengths of webbing. This idea is further supported by a black and white photograph taken from the back of the chair, presumably at the same time as the photo published by Margaret Jourdain and now in the collection of Fortt negatives held by the Furniture, Textiles and Fashion Department at the V&amp;A. It appears to show the current canvas. Derek Balfour (conservation upholsterer) and Frances Collard (V&amp;A curator noted in the 1990s that the double-thread weave of the canvas was similar to canvas on other chairs of the period which are known to retain their original upholstery. The nails that attach the battens could be earlier than 1924, although the crimson velvet (possibly cotton) dates from after that time. 


The chair is of standard mortise-and-tenon construction.  The arms show a down-curving profile and are notched on the underside about half way along, in a manner that is generally seen in oak armchairs of the 17th century. Because the upholstery has been repaired, it is difficult to understand how this appeared when the chair was new.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

Cotton embroidered with silk thread
Gujarat, Western India
c. 1700
IS.155-1953

This panel was part of a set of chintz and embroidered bed- and wall-hangings formerly in Ashburnham House in Sussex. The embroideries copy the designs of the chintzes in simplified form. The intense colours of the silk embroidery thread were produced by repeated dyeing with indigo (blue) and the insect dye
lac for red. [27/9/2013]
GUJARATI EMBROIDERY 

Gujaratis 'embroider the best of any people in India, and perhaps in the world', said one 18th-century English scholar. Gujarati embroidery was in huge demand in Europe in the 17th and 18th centuries. Men from Gujarat embroidered this hanging in chainstitch, using both a hook (ari) and needle. The cloth has nail-holes along its edges, suggesting that it was attached to a bed or wall-panel.

This is the Word of God revealed to the Israelites and recorded in the Scriptures. The most dominant feature of a synagogue is the Ark of the Law in which the Torah scrolls are kept. Immediately in front of it is the reading-desk (or almemor) on which the scrolls of the Torah are placed to be read; the reading-desk is covered with a decorative cloth. 

This almemor cloth has an embroidered panel 27"" long by 48"" wide.  Although it is not dated, the woven silk surrounding dates from the late 17th century. The greater part of the embroidery is worked with floss silk in brick stitch on a plainweave linen ground which had been extensively pieced together before being embroidered. The black inscriptions and the outlines of the motifs are corroding. Technically the embroidery is relatively complex: there is metal thread in certain areas, some  silk couched over white silk padding and French knots in the centre of flowers. 

Vases of flowers had no intentional symbolic meaning, although some people might see them as representations of fertility and abundance.  But other images on this cloth were deliberately chosen for their symbolism. The central features are the tablets on which the first word of each of the Ten Commandments is written, representing God's revelation to the Israelites, small hillocks represent Mount Sinai on which there are tongues of fire and above everything is the cloud from which God spoke. Unleavened bread to the right is a symbol of the Passover and to the left are bitter herbs. The inscriptions are from the Book of Proverbs (chapter iii verses 16 and 18) and refer, in this context, to the importance of the Torah scroll: ""Length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honour.  She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her"". The wooden rollers on which the scrolls were wound were called trees of life. 

One striking features of Jewish embroideries from North Italy is that most were embroidered by women. There are many known examples - one Ark curtain in the Jewish Museum in New York is dated 1680; it is from Venice and was embroidered by Simah, wife of Manahem Levi Meshullami, a member of a wealthy and prosperous family.  Another older curtain, dated 1630, was worked by the wife of the donor for a synagogue in Ancona and a binder for the Torah scrolls was embroidered by Rikah Polacco in 1662.

The Significance of Such Textiles:
What was the ceremonial significance of elaborately decorated synagogue hangings?  Jews living under Christian rule were never secure enough to enable them to build large synagogues to rival cathedrals and churches.  Their synagogues were modest and unassuming from the outside - although their location was discreet, the decoration of the inside of the building and its furnishings was often opulent, attesting to the prosperity of the worshippers.  A reasonably prosperous synagogue would possess several Ark curtains and reading-desk covers and the ones used would be chosen to compliment the season, or the feast or the occasion, for example, a marriage. 

This cover probably came from Venice. The city was a relatively secure place for Jews in the 17th century. In the previous century all Jews had been expelled from Southern Italy; Rome and Ancona were the only places within the Papal States where they could live; in Tuscany Jews could live only in Pisa.  But in Northern Italy they were able to live in a number of places and, except for occasional incidents, the Jewish communities there possessed enough stability and security to enable them to create beautiful works of art. 

Colourful embroideries fulfilled two distinct functions. They created a decorative background, much as painted and mosaic patterns did in churches and tile-work did in mosques.  They were used primarily for aesthetic purposes to create a beautiful environment and by doing so they gave pleasure and joy to the people who had gathered for worship.  They enhanced the rituals. In a more subtle way, by using images which recalled specific instances where God had helped his people - guiding them, giving them victory, forgiving them - the worshippers could re-live positive spiritual experiences of personal and national redemption. 

They reinforced good feelings about themselves as Jews and as a community and they gave them hope.  The congregation was reminded that ""they were adopted as sons, they were given the glory and the covenants, the Law and the ritual were drawn up for them and the promises were made to them.""   In a world of discrimination and active persecution, this positive feedback was necessary for their continued survival.  And so these beautiful embroideries were often more than decoration, they were a statement of identity, instilling  confidence and hope when they were most needed.

7, 8 Embroidered napkins
Turkey
1830–70


Embroidery was a popular form of decoration in the Ottoman home. Items such as napkins were embroidered with great quantities of colourful silk and metal thread in inventive designs. Images of ornate houses and gardens (the ideal Ottoman home) were fashionable in the 19th century.

These napkins are embroidered with various stitches including <i>muşabak</i>, meaning ‘netted’, a type of openwork found only on Ottoman embroidery. This can be seen most clearly in the green walls of the buildings in the napkin on the left.

It was placed over the turban when it was not in use to protect it from dust and disrespectful treatment.  Turbans indicated the rank of the wearer. They were removed like hats and not unwound.  The red woollen fez replaced turbans for all except the <i>ulema</i> (clergy) about 1827.   From about the 1720s onwards Ottoman embroidery stopped copying woven designs and became a truly creative art form. Designers introduced new, lifelike floral decorations, many of which were very detailed. They allowed some floral decorations to sway and sweep across the fabric. Some were stylised.  All decorations were worked in soft colours often enriched with metal thread.  The colours of many 18th century embroideries were originally very bright but they have faded to pleasing pastel shades.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Such stitch and pattern collections may have been assembled in any community in which embroidery for decorative effect was widely practised; our knowledge of early examples depends on the few pieces to have survived.

Sometimes equal emphasis is given to the stems and to the flowers but often the stems become secondary and are overwhelmed by the sheer abundance of blossoms. In some later examples the stems have disappeared but the diagonally placed flowers remain, in bands facing alternately left and right. Textiles such as this, worked in atma with two shades and red and two shades of blue, are difficult to date: the design is 17th century but the technique and palette are not typical.  It is possible that they come from the eastern Ottoman Empire.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This parochet was acquired before the Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition held at the Albert Hall in London in 1887. That exhibition marked an important point in the history of Jewish collecting, and the development of the study of Jewish ritual art. It prompted the formation of Jewish museums in various continental cities, but little additional Jewish material came into the V&A's collection until the 1950s.

As far as is known, most Jewish embroideries from Northern Italy were embroidered by women. There is a very similar Ark Curtain in the Jewish Museum, New York, which has a date equivalent to 1698, and was embroidered by a woman called Leah Ottolenghi. Another Ark Curtain in the same museum has the date equivalent to 1680; it was embroidered by Simah, wife of Mamahem Levi Meshullami.  Also in their collection is a narrow binder for the Torah Scrolls which was embroidered by Rikah Polacko in 1662 (inventory number 1988-21, given by Cora Ginsburg).. Rikah is thought to have been the mother of Joseph Polakco whose name appears on the V&A's curtain, and she may have made the curtain fourteen yeas after she completed the Torah binder.

The design of the curtain may have been made by a professional artist, possibly one who illuminated ketubahs (marriage certificates). Brides received a written contract from their grooms, which was usually highly decorated. Late 17th marriage certificates from Northern Italy can be compared with these embroidered synagogue hangings, as all are decorated in an artistic style which included formal vases of flowers (seen in the V&A's curtain in the lower part of the pillars forming the central arch).","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

In the corner is a scene of three Chinese people under a blossoming tree in a garden; on either side is a pagoda and a scene of two men punting a boat on a river. Over the corner scene, nearer the centre, is another garden scene with a lady playing a flute and a servant bringing a vase containing a plant. Various shades of red and purple are used for the flowers; green for the foliage; blue for the water; and the ground is white silk.The silk embroidery uses satin and split stitches. A fringe surrounds the shawl. The square shawl is not part of the Chinese dress tradition, the shape being dictated purely by the needs of European fashion, where they were both items of clothing and features in interior decoration, being draped over tables and pianos as well as being pinned on walls. The workshops where the shawl silk was woven must have had specialized weavers to set up the very wide looms needed to produce the roughly square pieces without seaming the material. In Victorian and Edwardian Britain these fringed shawls held appeal for their supposedly 'arty', somewhat bohemian associations rather than as components in the fashion mainstream.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This type of exotic tree pattern was immensely popular in Britain and Holland for furnishings and bed-hangings during the 17th and 18th centuries.

It could be used on the head or shoulders or tied around the hips. From about the 1720s onwards Ottoman embroidery stopped copying woven designs and became a truly creative art form: new, naturalistic floral motifs were introduced and many of them were depicted in great detail.  Some were allowed to sway and sweep across the fabric, some were stylised and many were enriched with metal thread.  The colours were originally very bright but have often faded to pleasing pastel shades. Although the technique of this piece is Ottoman, the drawing is more reminiscent of European botanical drawings of the mid-18th century.  This kerchief may have been embroidered in Istanbul, or in one of the former European provinces of the Otoman empire in which Ottoman embroidery and needlewomen were highly prized.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Made in Ethiopia around 1860

This dress was probably given to Queen Terunesh as part of her wedding dowry when she married Emperor Tewodros, aged about 12 years old. The dress has been extended with additional panels at the bottom, perhaps to allow the queen to continue wearing it as she grew older and taller. The series of embroidered bands around the neck hang down the front of the chest, mimicking a large piece of jewellery.

<i>I knew nothing of the history of Queen Terunesh, wife of a king and mother to a prince. Now I am gazing at her dress, its colour and embroidery preserved, a symbol of a young girl becoming a woman.</i>

Contemporary reports record that the widowed queen wished to be escorted back to her native province of Semyen but she died en route, possibly of lung disease. Her funeral took place on 16 May 1868 in the great church at Chelicut and was covered in the Illustrated London News. The queen’s possessions were sent on to the Secretary of State for India at the India Office in London. They were given to the South Kensington Museum (now the V&A) the following year.

1805

This stool was part of a set made for the reception of Napoleon by the corps législatif after his coronation as emperor. The set also included chairs, couches and a throne. The crossed-sword motif was particularly appropriate for the new power, which had been founded on military success. Curved sabres of this type were adopted by cavalry officers, inspired by the scimitars of the Mamluk warriors they fought in Egypt.

STOOL

W.3-1956

This stool bears a series of inventory marks for the Château de Saint-Cloud, and the maker's stamp 'JACOB D.R. MESLEE'. It is one of seven delivered to the Corps Legislatif in Paris in 1805. They were described as <i> 'à sabres antiques' </i> and cost 80 francs each.

The back of this chair is inspired by a design in Thomas Chippendale's The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director (Plate XII, 1754 and 1755 editions, Plate XIII, repeated in Plate XIV, 3rd edition, 1762).  The 'pedestal' or shoe for the back splat of one of this set of six chairs (W.62-1940) is inscribed in pencil '6 pedistals for Chipendels backs'.  It is likely that the maker was simply following Chippendale's published designs, rather than working for the firm.  The quality of the carving is not good enough for the chairs to have been made by the Chippendale firm.

Many versions were made by furniture makers throughout Britain and overseas, in a wide range of qualities. Without evidence from bills and inventories it is impossible to date such chairs closely. We know that workshops were producing chairs of this pattern more than 30 years after the 'Director' was published. When chairs were made following Director patterns, as in this example, it is only the back that is copied from the published plate. The seat and legs tend to be treated much more conventionally.

Chippendale's notes to the plate recommend that the design should be carefully drawn to scale before carving. He indicates that the fabric used to cover such chairs usually matches the window curtains. The height of the chair back should never be more than 22 inches (56 centimetres) above that of the seat. The mahogany would have been imported from the West Indies.

Some come from imported Indian textiles, others from various types of British needlework found on both dress and furnishings.  The stitched pattern of overlapping circles seen here can also be seen on quilted bed and cushion covers.

This dupatta, a woman’s shawl or head-cover, is woven from an extremely fragile combination of silk and strips of gilded silver. The women of the court of Hyderabad, a kingdom of legendary wealth, developed distinct styles of draping richly ornamented fabrics over kurta (tops) and paijama (trousers). Some of these styles are still in use in the region today. [01/08/2017]
SILVER HEAD-COVER 

Indian formal wear often has glittering metallic decoration sewn on to it. Much rarer are pieces like this with strips of silver and gilded silver actually woven into the fabric. Though further embellished with coloured metal foil (imitating jewels and beetles' wing-cases), the cloth remains flexible enough to be draped over the head or shoulders.

The Perfect Heel (Object No. 15)
Over the centuries, shoemakers have devised different solutions to elevating footwear. In the 18th century, a long wedged ‘Italian’ heel extended to the middle of the sole in an attempt to support the wearer’s weight. In the mid 19th century, ballerina-style shoes were equipped with simple square heels, sometimes just glued on. In the 1920s, the metal shank was invented and later the metal spike. These innovations could take more weight and meant that designers like Vivier could experiment with shapes, such as the Virgule (‘Comma’) heel.

Both men and women carried or wore pouches or purses. The long strings of this example suggest that it was intended to hang from the waist, but it is uncertain whether it was ever actually used as a container. English purses of this date are extremely rare and the survival of this one may be due to its formal role, which meant that it was rarely used and thought worth looking after.<br><br><b>Makers & Making</b><br>The workmanship of this purse is extremely fine with 1,250 silk stitches per square inch (194 per square centimetre).  Most surviving canvas work is much coarser. Whether this suggests that a professional hand was involved or that the woman  who made this was particularly skilled is not known.<br><br><b>Ownership & Use</b><br>Heraldic devices were displayed in many different ways, and their use on even small personal belongings such as this little purse indicates the important role that they had in proclaiming ownership and lineage.  The heraldry on this purse reflects four marriages (that is,  four family alliances), culminating in that of Sir Henry Parker and Elizabeth Calthorpe.

This <i>fukusa</i>has no lining. The cranes in the lower half are turning right and those on the upper half are turning left. This <i>fukusa</i>was donated by Mrs. Walts, whose brother, William Roger, was presented with it in 1874 at the ""Mikado's Palace"" in Japan.

In Japan since the early Heian period, 794-1184, cranes have been regarded as birds of longevity. This belief had it origin in China. In the Chinese Taoist book <i>Huainanzi</i> (<i>Enangi</i> in Japanese) written in the 2nd century BC, there is mention of ""a thousand year old crane."" The Chinese admired the crane for it beauty and regarded it as the companion of a legendary wizard. It later came to imply longevity. In Japan the crane is also loved for its elegant posture and its clear cry. In the <i>Manyoshu</i>, a collection of poems from 7th to 8th century, this cry is expressed as the ""one cry of a crane,"" meaning the final voice of authority. The idea that the crane combines aspects of  purity and naivete in its elegant features is derived from Taoist thought. There is a Japanese proverb, ""the crane lives thousand years, and the turtle lives ten thousand years."" The crane actually lives for about 80 years and therefore was considered to have a long life, especially when people had an average life span of 50 years. Since the crane continues to live in one place from generation to generation, it further promotes the idea of living for a long time. Hence, the crane and the turtle have become a highly revered symbol of longevity along with the <i>sho chiku bai</i>, pine, bamboo and plum. These patterns are commonly found not only on <i>fukusa</i> but also on art work and craft objects. The crane, as well as the turtle, is also associated with the sunrise, Mt. Fuji, <i>sho chiku bai</i>, auspicious clouds, the ocean, waves, the character of <i>kotobuki</i> etc., in order to express a sense of purity and longevity on a happy occasion. The crane is also a symbol of conjugal harmony as implied by its dance at  breeding time and two cranes together express conjugal bliss. At this time, according to legend, one has an open beak while the other has a closed beak, as an expression of a'un. (See p. 270)

Often the crane is shown in flight with a strip of paper attached to its leg. This motif is based on the legend of Minamoto Yoshitomo (1123-60?), and his son, Yoritomo who put gold plates on crane's legs when they flew from Yuigahama beach. The cranes flew back to Tazawa in Shizuoka prefecture hundreds of years later. In another story the lord of the Ii family in Hikone captured the cranes. This motif or design symbolises the long life of the crane.

This <i>fukusa</i> with a flock of flying cranes is a good omen, many <i>kotobuki</i>, or a hundred <i>kotobuki</i>, which is appropriate for any celebration.

It tells the story of the young woman who made it. She draws us in from the start. 'As I cannot write I put this down simply and freely as I might speak to a person...I can fully ...trust...'.  She tells us she was born in 1813 and lived with her parents and her ten brothers and sisters until the age of 13. She then left home to enter service as a nurserymaid. She describes what she sees as her own weaknesses and sins. She also describes how her employers treated her 'with cruelty too horrible to mention', and how she was tempted to kill herself. As the text continues her desperation increases, '...which way can I turn... wretch that I am …what will become of me...'. The despair of her words is heightened by the way she has formed them, using tiny red cross stitches on a plain ground. She breaks off in mid-sentence 'what will become of my soul'.

This sampler has aroused much interest since the V&A acquired it more than 50 years ago. Until recently we knew nothing about Elizabeth beyond her own words. In 1998 an English historian discovered details of who she was and of her family. An American historian has uncovered new information which reveals that Elizabeth did not die young and alone. She became a schoolteacher at the Ashburnham Charity School, in her home village. Although Elizabeth never married, she raised her sister's daughter. At some point in the 1850s she moved into the Ashburnham Almshouses, where she died aged 76 on 10 April 1889.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Many of these beetle wing cases were collected in Burma (Myanmar) and sold on through Kolkata (Calcutta). Valued for their hardness and permanence of colour, their reflective qualities were sometimes thought to ward off evil spirits. Beetle wings were used by both indigenous groups such as the Naga of N.E. India and in sumptuous Mughal court dress. Beetle wing embroidery became fashionable in Europe in the 19th century.

Watts Gift

The flock of cranes decorating this <i>fukusa</i> convey wishes for long life and happiness. Cranes were believed to live for a thousand years and to inhabit Mount Horai, the land of the immortals. They are one of the most common motifs in Japanese art. This <i>fukusa</i> would have been appropriate for celebrations of birthdays and weddings.

The design is executed almost totally with gold wrapped thread which is couched down with stitches that are virtually invisible to the naked eye. The wings of the birds are also padded. The embroidery looks particularly striking against the indigo blue background, which became a popular choice for <i>fukusa</i> from about 1850.

This <i>fukusa</i> was presented to an Englishman, William Rogers, at the Emperor's Palace in Japan in 1874. His sister gave it to the Museum in 1923. [December 1993]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Houghton  was built between 1722 and 1735 for Sir Robert Walpole, England's first prime minister. This suite furnished the second state apartment, which was initially planned as a large bedroom and smaller dressing room; but before the apartment was finished the dressing room became the bedroom, and the bedroom was turned into a cabinet of paintings. The bedroom houses a bed with colourful embroidered hangings, which appears to have been made around 1715-20 for an earlier house at Houghton. The green velvet chairs were probably made in the late 1720s, in a slightly old-fashioned style to suit the bed. The use of burr-walnut veneer (cut from the root parts of the tree), with carved and gilt gesso ornament, is a mark of the very highest-quality chair-making of the period.

Sydney Vacher wore this court suit for the laying of the foundation stone of the Victoria and Albert Museum on 17 May 1899.

The cut and form of the this style of suit were much the same as before, but the coat and breeches were usually made of black velvet instead of dark cloth. Waistcoats also tended to be made of plain white silk or black velvet.<br><br>By 1900 there were two main designs for court dress. This court suit is an example of the 'new style', which included a black velvet tailcoat which was worn open. The 'old style' consisted of a velvet frock coat with fronts sloping back from the waist, stand collar and black silk wig-bag.<br><br>In the early 20th century an alternative to these two styles was a cloth coat of mulberry, claret or green with matching breeches, and white waistcoat.

THE CONVERSION OF SAINT PAUL: an embroidery and its printed source<br>
Before the embroiderer of this panel (top) began work, the design was drawn onto the silk by a specialist, professional pattern drawer. He took his design directly from the print but modified it.  He raised the horizon, adding buildings and plants, and changed the positions of the figures in relation to one another. The embroiderer further adapted the print by choosing the colours to be used.

Princes' Kaftans from Ottoman Turkey

These three kaftans (and another in a nearby case) were worn by Ottoman princes who died when they were children. They were preserved in imperial tombs where, in accordance with Ottoman custom, they were placed over the graves of the deceased.

The kaftans may have come from the graves of the 19 younger sons of Sultan Murat III, who were executed at the succession of their half-brother, Mehmet III, in 1595. This gory practice, designed to avoid a struggle for the succession, was never repeated.

The kaftans, woven of silk and metal-wrapped thread, show that even in childhood, Ottoman princes were dressed in the same lavish style as the sultan and his courtiers. The wide range of designs of the time include a meandering vine set with tulips, which clearly influenced contemporary embroidery (see case opposite).

The fabric is woven in alternating bands of ivory and pink satin in a vertical ribbon pattern with a band of floral chiné velvet.  The sack is open at the front with elbow-length sleeves with single, scalloped sleeve ruffles.  The bodice meets at the centre front.  The sleeves are lined with linen; the bodice with white silk taffeta, open at the back.  The sack  has two, double box pleats at the back, extending from shoulder to hem.  At the front, the skirts are pleated into the waistseam.  The sack is made of 3 widths of silk at the back and sides.  The front skirts are each made of one partial panel of silk and 2 triangular gores, to shape over a fan-shaped hoop.  The hem is faced with a deep band of white silk taffeta.

The petticoat is made of four widths of silk pleated at the waist. 

The sack and petticoat were altered in the late 19th century for fancy dress.  The binding of the petticoat waist was removed and adjusted to lengthen the petticoat.  The seams of the sack  side gores were restitched to alter the shape of the skirts.  The waistseam at the fronts was unpicked and resewn.  A strip of whalebone was added either side of the lining opening at the back of the bodice.  Hooks and thread bars were added to the bodice fronts.  The sleeve ruffles were removed to shorten the sleeves, then re-sewn and pink silk ribbon bows added to cover them.  A narrower gathered ribbon was sewn to the right bodice front and lower edge of the left front.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

This is unlikely to have been caused by wear and tear, as the raised embroidery would have protected it; the silk may have been treated with a substance that accidentally accelerated the natural process of decay.

The repeating pattern of gold flower heads linked by short stems is rather subdued but it provides a solid pattern to contrast with the dramatic swirling silver cords that form the edging. In fact the metal thread used to create the flowers is not gold, or even gilt; it is silver strip wound around a yellow silk core, with several strands twisted together to form a cord.

The applied woven braid is also silver but appears to have a golden sheen when it is placed next to the pure silver colour of the edging. This effect has been achieved by stitching silver thread in a chevron pattern onto dark red silk cords. The cords were coiled into fluid swirls, secured by stitches on the reverse and then attached to the edge of the coat. A small square of woven braid has been inserted from the back to fill in gaps formed by the wave-like undulations which themselves have been edged with a row of tightly coiled silver cords.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

Oak and walnut, covered in leather with gilt and painted decoration.  The shagreen outer cover and gilt brass mounts probably added in about 1700.

This desk is a unique survival of royal luxury furniture with early Renaissance ornament.  It is painted with the Tudor royal arms and with badges and personal devices of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon.  An inscription on the inner lid asks God to grant Henry victory over his enemies.  The arms are flanked by figures of Mars and Venus derived from woodcuts of the Planets by Hans Burgkmair (1473 - 1531).

Quilted cot cover for a child's bed
Priscilla Redding (1654-1723), Kent
1690-1720

Born in Deal Castle, where her father was governor, Priscilla Redding married in Canterbury in 1691, where she is likely to have obtained the silk velvets, satins and silver-gilt fabrics used here. Her contemporary Celia Fiennes described Canterbury as 'a flourishing town' with 'good tradeing in ye weaving of silks', and shopping for goods for the home was one of the primary attractions.

Personal diary
Priscilla Redding (1654-1723), Kent
1678-1723

Few early accounts survive that document the lives of quilt makers. So it is rare to be able to link the diary of Priscilla Redding with this patchwork quilt. Her father, a Baptist preacher, was arrested during the Restoration, and she writes of his 'great persicution and truble' for 'not conforming to the worshipe of the nation'. She also records family births and deaths, from the arrival of her first child to the distressing loss of her only son. Both quilt and diary were passed down to her daughter, Susanna.

Parade armour was ostentatious and showy, governed by the same aesthetics that shaped, distorted and adorned contemporary clothing. The armours associated with these gauntlets were designed to be worn with rich velvet hose and silk stockings which combined to create a single outfit. Brightly coloured plumes atop the helmet completed the impression of other-worldly magnificence. A very rare survival on these gauntlets is the crimson silk velvet lining decorated with gold and silver thread. Its presence provides a soft contrast to the hard steel and reminds us that the combination of rich fabrics and virtuoso metalworking turned the armoured body into a work of art.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples. 

Quilting is a method of stitching layers of material together. The layers are most commonly divided as follows:

Quilt top: The decorative layer of the quilt. If the top is pieced (such as this example), it is known as a 'patchwork quilt'.

Wadding/batting: A layer of cotton, wool, polyester, silk or other material, which adds warmth and dimension to the quilt. 

Reverse: The bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric. 

Hand-quilting is done on a frame using needles called 'betweens'. The stitches are executed with one hand; the other hand is kept underneath the quilt to feel for the needle. Small, uniform stitches (usually a 'running stitch') are taken through the three layers to form a decorative design.

This small cot cover is thought to have been created by Priscilla Redding of Deal, Kent. Born in Deal Castle, where her father was governor, Priscilla Redding married in Canterbury in 1691, where she may have obtained some of the silks used here. Her contemporary Celia Fiennes described Canterbury as 'a flourishing town' with 'good tradeing in ye weaving of silks', and shopping for goods for the home was one of the primary attractions.

The box has a sloping top and a double lid, the outer enclosing a shallow tray contained in the inner lid, which opens to disclose three divisions, two with lids. The fall-down front encloses three drawers, the centre one divided into partitions and those on the side fitted with sliding lids. There is a small drawer with compartments fitted at the right side. The interior is covered with leather painted and gilt. The inside of the outer lid is decorated with interlaced strapwork, enclosing the badges of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon (see below for further detail). The inner lid bears the arms of Henry VIII encircled by the Garter, and with putti blowing trumpets as supporters. On either side are figures of Mars in armour, and Venus with Cupid, each under Renaissance canopies. The lids in the interior are painted with a medallion head of Christ and Saint George and the Dragon below a canopy. The front, above the three small drawers, is decorated with a male and a female profile head  and scrollwork designs; the falling flap bears profile heads of Paris and Helen, inscribed 'Paris de Troy' and 'Helen de Greci' on a ground of arabesques.
The rim below the outer lid is covered in parchment and bears the inscription in classical lettering (much rubbed): 'DEUS REGNORUM EC[CLESIAE] CHRISTIAN[A]E MAXIMUS PROTECTOR IMPERII DA SERVO TUO HENRICO OCT[AVO] REGI ANGLIAE DE HOSTE TRIUMPHUM M[AGNUM].

The exterior of the desk is covered with shagreen and fitted with metal-gilt angle-mounts, loop handles and ball feet, all added during the 18th century.
The interior surfaces of the compartments are lined with red silk velvet, probably added during the 19th century. The writing surface and the large compartment have been relined very crudely with a crimson silk velvet, the appearance of which is considerably older than that of the red velvet.

Detailed description of the underside of the outer lid (undated, from curatorial file):
The outer lid is lined with gilt and painted leather decorated with badges and personal devices of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. The background of the leather panel is of a tan colour with an overall pattern of interlacing four-lobed knots forming four rows each containing five circular divisions, in which are painted the badges. The arabesque pattern does not quite fit the size of the lid, and gives the impression of being a section cut from a larger piece of leather decorated with al all-over pattern. The badges are as follows:

Top row, left to right:
1)	On a blue ground, a lozenge in gilt with a red ground within it on which seems to be painted a pomegranate dimidiating a rose, (this area is badly rubbed). A badge of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. 
2)	Gilt concentric circles with a palmette design outlined in black, enclosing a gold fleur-de-lis on a green ground. A badge of Edward III and Henry VII also adopted by Henry VIII.
3)	On a blue ground, a gilt 8-pointed star formed of a square on a square and enclosing a gold rose on a red ground. A badge of the Tudor house.

Materials: 
A report on the materials used for the box was made by J.A. Darrah, 17/8/1976 (copy on dept. file):
Oak: base, sides, drop front, probably the back and the lid, long side drawer (with walnut bottom)
Walnut: interior fittings and three small drawers
Shagreen dyed black (probably ray) - applied to the external surfaces
Gilt-brass - fittings
Interior surface of the lid, the lower surface of the writing surface, the lids of the drawers and compartments and the drawer fronts are covered with undyed, buff coloured leather. The basic design of the decoration was applied to this in gold leaf outlined and detailed with black pigment. Large background areas were then coloured blue, figures painted in flesh tints with brown hair and highlights applied to the gold leaf with red and green glazes. The pigments used are azurite (blue), vermillion (red), calcium carbonate [chalk] (white), carbon black, iron oxide(?) (brown), chalk and vermillion (pink), copper resinate (green glaze), dragon's blood(?) for red glaze.
The internal surfaces of the compartments are lined with scarlet cotton velvet, not available until the 18th century, and laid onto a woodpulp cardboard (not used until the 19th century). The writing surface and the large compartment have been relined crudely with a crimson silk velvet, apparently pre-18th century.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

It was a style that dominated women’s fashions during the 18th century. It developed from a loose negligee but by the 1770s it had become a more formal type of dress and would have been worn for attending assembly rooms, dinner parties, the theatre or the opera. 

This is a very rare example of the use of velvet in 18th-century women’s dress. Normally fabrics are printed after the weaving process. In the chiné technique, the warp threads are printed before, and during weaving the slight pulling of the threads gives the pattern a blurred effect, resembling a watercolour when finished. In this extraordinary example, the chiné process has been combined with velvet - a difficult technique that was produced only in a few places in France. The silk for this fabric is reputed to have cost 36 shillings a yard. With an average of 17 yards required for a sack and petticoat of this style, the fabric would today cost about £2,200.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/velvet"

The coat has been decorated using three techniques: patchwork, embroidery and appliqué. A strip of blue leather, embroidered with a meandering stem of leaves and flower heads, has been inserted into the natural brown leather that forms the cloak. Sprays of stylised flowers and leaves have been embroidered onto the brown leather using satin-stitch, with the silk thread taken all the way through the leather and back again. The scalloped band of leather running across the lower end of the image has been applied on top of the brown leather actually covering part of the embroidery. The garment has been finished with tabs and tassels. Its decoration demonstrates how skilfully tough leather can be worked. This occupation requires great strength and was always the preserve of men.

The ravages of wear and time have changed the appearance of this cloak. Many of the coloured skins have faded from their original rather acid tones and most of the wool has decayed and fallen out, although part of a deep border of black lambskin can be seen at the very bottom of the image.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This chasuble is the vestment (priestly garment) worn by a Catholic priest when celebrating the Mass. It was - and is - worn over the alb and stole. 

Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time.  The combination of secular and ecclesiastical textiles is not unusual in vestments, the silk being suitable for both secular and ecclesiastical use, the iconography of the embroidered orphreys being specifically ecclesiastical. This chasuble has been made of Italian (or Spanish) velvet, cut down from its original bell shape into the fiddle shape that became popular in the early seventeenth century. The use of two different velvets and the evidence of stitchmarks from previous incarnations do not allow exact identification of the time of making of the garment - but do indicate how highly valued such textiles were even after they had been used. The colour suggests this chasuble would have been worn on the feast days of martyrs. 

The velvet on the back is identical to velvets in the Lehman collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and a chasuble in the Schnutgen Museum. It is an elaboration of the basic pomegranate motif, with floral and foliage excretions growing out from the central motif contained within the framing compartments (Thurman, no. 104, p. 179; Museum Schnutgen, no. 27, pp. 142-3). 

<i>Orphreys</i>.
The shape of the orphreys (column on the front, y-shaped cross on the back) was typical of the Netherlands till the mid sixteenth century and the Rhineland, according to Johnstone. She asserted that the orphrey was probably from Bohemia (the current Czech Republic, a geographical area encompassing Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia).  'Orphreys of this period frequently shared features of the Rhineland orphreys, the short-armed Gabelkreuz, the realistic wood of the cross, curving rays in the haloes, and so on. The crucifixion scene also shows strong likenesses with the wall paintings at Karlstejn [20 km south of Prague].'(Johnstone, col. pl. XVIII F and p. 42). The same combination of materials, imagery and form is found in the chasuble catalogued as Rhineland, late 15th century in the Schnutgen Museum (Museum Schnutgen, no. 63, pp. 240-1). 

A number of objects in the Schnutgen Museum in Cologne conform to this format and style. They are dated to the end of the fifteenth century.(Museum Schnutgen, nos. 9, pp.80-1, 27, pp. 142-3, 30, pp. 151-3.) 

<i>Symbolism</i>. 
The birds and feathers within the imagery are probably as symbolic as the direct Christian messages from the crucifixion scene. Such associations came from Bestiaries which originated in England in the 11th century, containing tales around real and fantastic animals, often with a moral content. 

It seems likely that the bird above the cross is an eagle rather than a cock (as suggested in the original entry in the Accessions Register) because the eagle is specifically associated with St John the Evangelist and the Gospels in general, is the highest flier, and may represent Christ or the human spirit aspiring to God. The cock, in contrast, is sometimes a symbol of vigilance, but is usually associated with St Peter's denial of Christ. This bird lacks the crest of a cock and has a decidedly rapacious appearance, very similar to the outstretched form found on lecterns in churches.

The peacock feathers used for the wings of three of the angels are a common device. Peacocks were symbols of immortality, as the ancients believed that the flesh of the peacock was incorruptible. They appear frequently in Early Christian mosaics. 

The significance of Christ's blood in late-medieval Christianity and in depictions of the Crucifixion in different media has been explored recently in the context of Germany and would illuminate the graphic references in the (now faded) blood spurting from Christ's wounds and its collection into chalices by angels. (Caroline Walker Bynum. <i>Wonderful Blood. Theology and practice in late medieval Northern Germany and beyond</i>. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007).

The colour of the triplets may also be significant. In 'The Curious Law of Precious Stones' George Frederick Kuntz quotes from 'Speculum lapidum', Leonardi, 1502, that rubies 'removed evil thoughts, controlled amorous desires, dissipated pestilential vapours, and reconciled disputes'.  So quite apt for a liturgical vestment.

With decorative stripe patterns, horizontal on the loom and vertical on the robe. Thick self-colour stripes, joined by shoots of thicker cotton weft unevenly spun, are flanked by narrow strips where the weft is less tightly beaten together than in the main body of the material, giving a three dimensional effect. In addition, at intervals of over a foot (12 inches), are single rows of knots in white and red cotton, round four or five warp threads with a pile of over two inches, forming fringes. These alternate with bands of flat woven decoration with small repeating geometric motifs in blue, red-brown, yellow and white. The stripes of the flat decoration and three of the tufted are on each side of the robe, with an extra narrower stripe of the flat decoration under the armhole without the join.

The join and edges of slits are neatly covered by a very narrow braid of red, white, blue, green and yellow silk.

Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. This may account for the beautiful construction of the back and the rather less refined construction of the front. 

On the back, the embroidered orphreys (decorative bands) have been attached to two pieces of red brocaded silk so that the gold camels in the pattern march across the textile horizontally, flanked by flowers and foliage. The most elaborate embroidered motifs are also on the back – the Crucifixion, biblical and saintly figures, and two shields or coats of arms bearing the personal devices of Sir Thomas Erpingham: an eagle rising and the red rose of Lancaster. Erpingham (about 1375–1428) was a close associate of Henry IV and Henry V and a veteran of the Battle of Agincourt (1415). The chasuble may have been for his personal chaplain, or for a church with which he was connected.

The silk was probably made in Italy; the embroidered orphreys were probably made in England which was renowned for high quality needlework of this type (often called 'opus anglicanum', literally 'English work'). The high cost of the materials may explain why the front of the chasuble has been put together from small pieces of the silk. The chasuble has been reduced from its original 'bell' shape cut to suit the more fashionable 'fiddle' shape of a later period (in or after the 17th century). Precious silk and fine embroidery, especially containing metallic threads, were used economically, and were often recycled.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/36ca1128-a760-3f5c-9091-72f03ac1d154","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","This chasuble is made of two different velvets (front and back), both probably dating from the fifteenth century, two different plain-weave linen linings (front and back), and column orphrey on the front, a Y-shaped cruciform (<i>Gabelkreuz</i>) orphrey on the back. The orphreys seem to match each other in style and technique, though they have been cut down from longer pieces at some point before being applied to these velvets. A pink linen is used to line the back and an undyed linen the front. There is some evidence of a red dye staining the back. (During conservation, blue linen was found stitched into the seams at the neck, possibly evidence of a previous lining, and some very hard linen crin.) Some wax adheres to the front (that on the back was removed during conservation).

The red cut velvet of the front has a less complex design than that on the back. The symmetrical pattern is built up around a simple pomegranate motif on the front, and a more complex composition comprising both pomegranate and flowers on the back. Both velvets belong to the type described as ferronerie because of the finely delineated motifs which look like ironwork. On the back it is clear that prior to the application of this particular orphrey, a simple Latin cross had been stitched to the velvet. The front of the chasuble is heavily pieced, so that no single repeat of the very long motif is present (no less than eleven pieces of velvet have been cobbled together to create the front).

The orphreys are made of linen, embroidered with silver, silver-gilt and polychromatic silks (shades of blue, green, red, yellow). They are very worn in areas, thus making visible the linen ground and the inked outline drawn for the embroiderer to follow. Some areas of the design have been built up into raised work, providing a three-dimensional effect. Couched work and split stitch are the main forms of stitching, though there is also evidence of knotting (possibly not original).
 
The front column orphrey is embroidered with two full-length figures under Gothic canopies: the Virgin and child at the top, a saint with a crown below, holding a chalice and wafer (the Host). The figures are mainly embroidered in colours, though their attributes, the edge of their garments and their haloes are in metal thread. The background is of metal thread couched down. 

The Y-shaped orphrey on the back has a ground of metal thread couched down. The dominant feature is the figure of Christ crucified on the cross (this figure is at least ten inches longer than any other on the band). At the foot of the cross stand the Virgin (hands in a gesture of prayer) and St John (a book in his hand). These figures have been cut down to fit the chasuble. The figure of Christ is long and emaciated, the original shading of the embroidery clearly showed the rib cage, and the contrast of the blood spouting from the wounds inflicted by the gruesomely large metal nails which pierce his feet and hands, and raised work emphasising his facial features and his halo. The halo is not only lavish in embroidery but also has three triplets (glass; see below) incorporated to highlight the cross embedded in the design (one triplet is now missing).* These must have caught the light. To the left and right of the cross, within the arms of the orphrey are small-scale, bust-length figures of angels, two on each side, all with haloes and wings. On the right, the figure with its head covered with its mantle, points to the cross (probably an older woman to go by the attire), while below the figure with long golden tresses, a diadem and peacock feather wings holds out a three-dimensional chalice to catch the blood of Christ. The chalice is formed in such a way that the blood can actually drip into it. On the left are two completely bare-headed angels, the lower one holding a chalice in the same way as his counterpart on the right hand side. Above the cross is a scroll containing the inscription INRI (the initials almost entirely worn away). A bird (eagle), wings spread, rests its claws on the scroll while behind him two peacock-winged angels swing hanging censers made of raised gold thread work The cross is very realistically depicted, some attempt at perspective being introduced through the use of plain versus 'grained' planes of the wood.


* Triplets are gems made from three different components which can be a broad spectrum of materials. In the case of the chasuble, the intention appears to have been to simulate cabochon rubies. The triplets here are made from two pieces of colourless transparent glass, each in cabochon form, the bases in contact, between the two is a transparent red cement. The joint is covered by the fabric 'setting'.  As the red colour is reflected around the colourless glass the overall appearance is that of a gem with a red body colour.  The cement has oxidised over time and so contracted and crizzled towards the edges and the colour is now largely lost.

In contrast, the delicate ruffle of silk chiffon which has been attached around the collar and the front edges is soft and falls into ripples of gossamer as it caresses the wearer's neck.  It is totally femine and very unusual in a garment of this type. Although it is securely attached, the quality of the stitching is poor which suggests it has been added by another hand--probably to make the jacket reflect western European fashion.

The combination of secular and ecclesiastic imagery is not unusual in vestments, the silk being suitable for both secular and ecclesiastical use, the iconography of the embroidered orphreys being specifically ecclesiastical and the coats of arms secular.

Although the chasuble cannot be identified among the records of the many vestments that Sir Thomas Erpingham gave to Erpingham (Norfolk) and other churches, it may have been made for his personal chaplain or for a church with which he was connected.

An image of the Crucifixion can be seen with the Virgin and St John at the foot of the Cross and angels holding chalices in which to catch the blood of Christ.

The orphrey was probably originally attached to another chasuble and was cut off and re-used here. It is likely that the orphrey, with its very distinctive style of bold images and figures with large heads, was worked in Bohemia. Embroidery was highly regarded in the medieval period in Europe and at its finest matched goldwork and painting. 

The velvet was made in Italy or Spain, then the centres for velvet weaving in Europe, and provided an ideal foil for rich embroidery. The style of  'pomegranate' shaped motifs on the voided velvet (a technique whereby the design is produced by leaving areas free of velvet) came to typify Renaissance textile design.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

There is an undulating stem linking a blue outlined carnation, 2 red berries and a purple and white flower, a blue carnation in profile with a large pink and red segmented blossom behind it, 2 blue pointed flowers and a large flower in bands of blues, pink/red and yellow, white and purple.  The border is identical on the left and right hand sides [ie. It is not a mirror image].
The central panel is divided into a flattened lobed arch with laid purple silk couched with white silk.  The spandrels contain a diamond lattice formed by pairs of leaves, each diamond contains a red or a blue carnation head with the colours arranged in diagonal lines which meet along the central vertical axis to form chevrons.  In each of the upper corners is an inward pointing diagonal vase like the ones in the corner squares.  There is a roundel at the top of the niche which contains and embroidered green inscription on a yellow ground. The roundel is edged with plain red and green threads and a diagonally coloured pink and green band and laid and couched purple thread. The niche is quilted with green silk in a scale design.  It is also embroidered with a straight repeat of upright pink flowers outlined in red alternating with smaller pink and purple flowers bending slightly to the left.

Fine blue cotton that can be easily gathered has been used to form the upper part of the garment, and it reappears at the bottom of each leg, where it is gathered into a narrow cuff at the ankle. In between a strong blue cotton has been used that is coarser and more hardwearing, but less suitable for gathering.

Coloured strips of fine cotton embroidered with a lace-like pattern in red and white and in red and black have been sewn together and then attached to the coarse cotton legs. The seams between the strips have been disguised by red or black silk threads that have been laid along them and stitched in place with white silk through both thicknesses of fabric. The small rosettes within the lace pattern were also embroidered through both thicknesses.

Strips of block-printed cotton have been used on the inside of each leg, partly because printing was cheaper than embroidery and that part of the trousers would not been seen. Also, the inner leg is subjected to much wear and tear and printed fabric would have been cheaper to replace. If you look at the black strip to the right of the printed one, you will see that a patch of plain black cotton has been sewn on top of the lower part because the lower part of the embroidery has worn thin and has torn in places.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The split stitch embroidery was worked through all three layers. It is not essential to add a decorative backing to embroideries but in this example the extra thickness increases the durability of mat and conceals the inevitable loose embroidery threads. The design printed on the backing is a popular motif based on the 'boteh', a Persian word for a flowering shrub.  It was an important element in Persian textile design in the19th century and, with great skill, textile designers were able to create many different effects within the limits imposed by its rather rigid, curving form.

The prayer mat was acquired from the private collection of Jules Richard (1816-1891), a Frenchman living in Iran. He arrived in Tehran in 1844 as a language teacher, and converted to Islam, taking the name Mirza Riza. He was probably the first photographer in Iran and was the interpreter for the Shah, Nasir al-Din, on his visit to Europe in 1873.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This is unlikely to have been caused by wear and tear, as the raised embroidery would have protected it; the silk may have been treated with a substance that accidentally accelerated the natural process of decay.

The repeating pattern of gold flower heads linked by short stems is rather subdued but it provides a solid pattern to contrast with the dramatic swirling silver cords that form the edging. In fact the metal thread used to create the flowers is not gold, or even gilt; it is silver strip wound around a yellow silk core, with several strands twisted together to form a cord.

The applied woven braid is also silver but appears to have a golden sheen when it is placed next to the pure silver colour of the edging. This effect has been achieved by stitching silver thread in a chevron pattern onto dark red silk cords. The cords were coiled into fluid swirls, secured by stitches on the reverse and then attached to the edge of the coat.

The band is edged with four green lines of weft. This band is edged by two narrow weft stripes of metal thread either side. 
[d] On the back, from the arm-hole edge, in the top section, which is a loom width, there is a section of pattern [c] followed by a 3 cm tongue of metal thread 31.5 cm long leading into a wide Y-section of metal thread 42.5 cm wide and extending across the whole loom width. There are numerous narrow weft lines following this outline.  The stem of the Y-shape is patterned with a lozenge shape and ‘tower’ form in blue/purple flanked by a partial green stripe either side. Another 3 cm tongue of metal thread follows.
[e] The centre back neck has a warp band 7 cm with zigzag edges either side of gold metal thread, around the actual neck at the back is a 3 cm panel of metal thread embroidered in  close diagonal stitching leading into four rows of small metal thread spiral roundels joined with white silk (creating the impression of spangles) with a line of faded purple chain stitch. Narrow weft stripes of the same extend 21.5 cm.
Silk: Warp: black and white combined to form grey, red, blue/purple, light green
Metal Thread: silver strip open S-wound on white silk core and silver-gilt strip open S-wound of yellow silk core. The metal threads are often carried on the back from one group of tapestry-weaving to the next.
Decoration on the shoulder seams uses faded purple silk and silver strip close s-wound on a silk core [probably white].","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

This red velvet jacket has been smothered with gold thread, laid on the surface in intricate interlacings and secured to the velvet by minute, almost invisible silk stitches. The use of the couching technique ensured that no expensive metal thread was wasted by being taken through to the reverse side.

Lines of yellow tacking stitches were used to mark out the main areas of the pattern, and were often left in place when the embroidery was finished. Pins would have been used to secure small areas of metal threads in their convoluted swirls until they were couched in place. Because velvet is a pile fabric it is difficult to mark a pattern onto it for the embroiderer to follow. At best only the general outlines could be given, so although the pattern on the two front panels is very similar, it is not identical.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

Instead of using simple seams, the sleeves and gussets have been attached with embroidered insertions worked in linen thread.

The silk used for the robe was woven with a fine black floral stripe at wide intervals, and a meandering floral stem has been embroidered in the intervening spaces. This pattern was first printed on the ground fabric with dark ink, which can be seen clearly in several places, and was then embroidered using a tambour hook. The completed length of woven and embroidered silk was then cut into the appropriate pieces for the robe. It has been edged with a metal braid.

Tambour work is only possible if the fabric is held very tightly in a frame.

Two colours of metal thread have been used. They were made by winding flat metal strips around a yellow silk core: small amounts of a reddish or coppery gold outline the silver cords while the rest of the embroidery is worked with glittery yellow gold.

This heavy coat requires no fastenings to keep it in place. Despite this, 22 large buttons have been added. Each one is hand-made by winding silk thread around a core that was usually made of wood or a solid pad of fibre. For the final layer a metal thread was plaited into a pattern using a needle. Each button is decorated with five beads of coral, which was believed to protect against evil.

Yazd, Iran
About 1840–70

Like other religious minorities in Iran, Zoroastrians were required to dress to identify their religion. They wore brightly coloured clothing and did not usually veil their faces. This created an obvious contrast with the outdoor clothing worn by Muslim women. A Zoroastrian woman would typically wear a tunic (qamis), together with loose trousers (shalvar) gathered at the ankle. These trousers were made from textile remnants because there were restrictions on Zoroastrians buying full widths of fabric. Women covered their heads with a small fitted cap (lachak), over which they would wrap several shawls around their head and shoulders.

John Jones, the original owner of this stool and its pair (1031A-1882), was a military outfitter, who lived in London and used his wealth to form an extensive collection of French 18th-century decorative art. In 1882 he left the collection to the South Kensington Museum, the forerunner of the V&A. Jones was taken in by some 19th-century fakes, but it is unlikely that he was taken in by these.

SETTEE
ENGLISH; about 1690
Carved and turned walnut upholstered in cross-stitch needlework trimmed with galloon and fringed.

Bought with the funds of the Bryan Bequest.

The settee came from Hampton Court, Leominster, for which it was probably acquired by Thomas Coningsby, later Earl of Conynsby, an imperious and choleric gentleman of ancient family, who was one of the last of the nobility to employ a bard and jester.

Those shown in this bed head are some of the most favoured: griffons and harpies; animals such as hounds and owls; and anthropomorphs including satyrs, centaurs, sphinx-like figures and phytomorphs.

Elements of these grotesques have been sourced from the engraved works of Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, whose <i>Livre de Grotesques</i> was published in Paris in 1566. The plates were designed to serve as models for artists and craftsmen, du Cerceau directing they should be used  'to awaken their minds and so that each may apply what he finds appropriate to his craft'.(quoted in Brugerolles and Guillet, Paris, 1995, p.58.)

Recent scholarship by Phillipe Morel has encouraged a shift in the traditional art historical reading of the grotesque. Grotesques have long been seen as fantastical and nonsensical products of the artist's imagination, removed from all constraints of a specific iconographical programme. Morel argues that grotesques adhere strictly to antique models and follow a delineated set of principles and rules derived from burlesque literature and other sources, demonstrating an order that would seem at odds with their classification as whimsical caprices. That grotesques proliferated across all forms of the fine and decorative arts during the Renaissance, suggests that their significance has as yet been underestimated and their interpretation in art historical literature still leaves much to be explored. 

Morel also draws attention to the 'wunderkammer' effect produced by Renaissance grotesques, and indeed those depicted in this bed head, with its assortment of curious beasts compartmentalised within the strapwork, are reminiscent of a cabinet of curiosities.(Morel, Flammarion, 1997)

This specimen is thought to be the only known example of a complete and unaltered tester for a 16th century bed. It has a pattern in yellow satin, cut to shape and applied to the blue satin ground. The design consists of scaffolding of bandwork forming varied shaped compartments, with grimacing masks and human and half-human figures holding music sheets, musical instruments, leafy branches or baskets, or grappling with strange beasts and birds. The detail is embroidered in silk thread. The workmanship is of the highest professional quality and suggests a princely commission.

This bed-head was originally though to be Italian as the grotesque style started there. The term grotesque related to images found principally in Nero's Golden Palace in Rome when it was 'rediscovered' in the 16th century by Italian artists. 'Grotesque' was an adjective derived from 'grotto' and did not relate to the eerie nature of the images. The style became particularly favoured in France, from a comparatively early date, through the influence of Italian artists working in the French court. 

The design of the embroidery seen here is a French variation of the grotesque style, related, for example to the grotesque prints done from 1550 onwards, by Paris engravers Jacques Androuet du Cerceau and Etienne Delaune. Two small fragments of a French embroidered bed valance identical in style to this panel are in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris and must be part of same bed ensemble.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/facet/embroidery"

The old lady was fond of the drinking water from a certain river, and of raw fish from the same place, which was a considerable distance from their house, but they daily made the journey to gratify her fancy. At last rewarded them by causing a spring to appear near their house which yielded two carp every day. The scene shows Chang She returning to the house with two pails of water. The river and mountains appear in the distance.
