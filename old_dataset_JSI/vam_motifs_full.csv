"'The virginal is in typical Northern European rectangular form with an integral case with lid and drop-front attached. The case walls, due to the nature of the decoration, cannot be measured but are at least of 15mm thickness. The case is covered without in leather, tooled and gilt with a border of floral scrollwork and small animals. The lid contains eighteen panels, worked in high relief in coloured glass, containing scenes from Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>, each identified below with a brief title. These scenes are framed with strips of white enamel bearing floral scrollwork. The inner face of the drop-front is divided into five panels, each of which was probably originally set with enamelled plates that have a blue ground and floral motifs (the colours of which have decomposed). Three of these enamelled plates remain; the second and fourth are missing and have been replaced by crudely cut-out engravings of birds and butterflies pasted to the red ground of the wooden backing. Another enamelled panel, similar but containing a head of a woman among the scrollwork, is set above the keyboard. Surrounding all these panels and covering the entire keyboard is a decoration consisting of coloured glass rods, rosettes and sequins, and of small spirals of brass wire.

"<u>Design</u> \nAn upholstered mahogany armchair, with covers of figured wool velvet. The square frame has a wide seat and low, raked back, both fully upholstered, open arms with swept mahogany supports and upholstered arm-rests, and square legs – the back legs raked – joined by four peripheral stretchers, the side stretchers lower than those at front and back. All four legs are on brass castors, with laminated leather rollers. The square-edged upholstery, in a three-coloured wool velvet on a plain linen ground, is ‘quilted’ on the back and seat panels, ‘welted’ with blue silk-wrapped cord at every seamed angle, and close-nailed – with brass-domed nails – on the back or bottom edges of the back, seat and arms. The outside-back is covered in a blue-green wool twill. \n\nThe rather massive, square form of the chair is subtly lightened by several features: the scrolled ends of the upholstered arm-rests; the tapered, curved form of the arm-supports, rounded on their top face; the slightly rounded top face of the stretchers, the chamfer on the inside corner of each leg, and the bevelled front corners of the raked back legs in a further kick-back below the stretchers (the back corners are bevelled in the full height of the legs). The upholstery is also worked so as to lighten the chair’s mass, chiefly in the ‘quilting’ of the back and seat, which breaks up these large square surfaces with carefully spaced stitched indents. (The modern term for ‘quilting’ – as it was called in the 18th century – is ‘tufting’, because usually the indents are filled with small tufts of silk or other textile, but in this chair the indents are empty.) \n\n<u>Construction</u> \nThe frame is made of mahogany for the visible elements (legs, stretchers and arm-supports) and beech for the rest (beech is visible in the seat rails and braces, the arm-rests, and the uprights of the back frame; a small exposed area of the top rail also appears consistent with beech). The back and right seat rails have wanes (natural chamfers on the curve of the trunk) on their lower inside edge, and on the back rail the bark remains attached. \n\nThe chair is joined mainly by mortise-and-tenon construction, without use of pegs (as far as can be seen). The stretchers and seat rails are tenoned to the legs, and the seat joints are reinforced with open braces across all four corners, keyed into notches in the rails. In the back-frame a bottom rail (which can be felt at the bottom of the back upholstery) must be tenoned to the uprights, which in turn are tenoned to the full-width top rail (this can be partly felt and partly seen through a hole in the outside-back cover). The back legs extend above the seat, tapering to a point about 12 cm above the upholstery (18 cm above the seat rails), to support the raked back from behind. They are screwed to the uprights of the back-frame, which are each keyed into a notch at the top of the side seat rail, to counteract the pressure exerted by a person leaning against the back. The profile of the back is made to appear of consistent thickness, even where the tapered leg lies behind the upright, by tapering the upholstery of the back reciprocally, down to a point at the bottom (where there is virtually no stuffing between the upright and the velvet cover). \n\nIn the arms, the swept supports are mitred to the front legs (the mitre running down and backwards from the front top corner of the leg); the legs may be tenoned to the supports, or the two elements may be joined by a loose tenon. The arm supports are tenoned to the arm rests, which seem to be tenoned (or perhaps joined by a bridle joint) to the uprights of the back-frame. \n\nThe rails and stretchers are very slightly bevelled on all their exposed edges; this makes the chair slightly easier to handle than a sharp-edged frame would be. \n\nThe mahogany has been darkened by an application of stained wax(?) polish, except on the underside of the stretchers where the natural, paler colour is still visible. On this pale surface, however, there are dark blotches and dribbles, indicating that the polish has been renewed. \n\nThe brass castors, with laminated leather rollers, are fixed by circular plates screwed to the underside of the legs, each with three dome-headed screws. \n\nAt the front end of each side rail, just behind the front leg, a hand-made screw has been driven in from the outside and the tip comes through the inside face. These screws have no apparent explanation in the construction or upholstery of the chair. \n\n<u>Upholstery</u> \nThe armchair is covered in a figured wool velvet, showing large red and yellow flowers, and blue stems and foliage with yellow accents, against an undyed linen background woven with no pile. The velvet is 53 cm wide excluding its selvages. It is placed with the warp running from front to back or vertically, according to its position (but never laterally), and has been seamed with added pieces at the sides of the seat (on the main panel, the front border and the side borders) and of the back (on the main panel and top border), to make up the width. On the main back panel the added pieces are made to mirror (rather than extend) the adjacent motifs, and on the front border of the seat the two added motifs mirror each other; but on the main seat panel no attempt has been made to match the motifs in the added pieces. Moreover the added pieces in the seat are themselves pieced out with small additions at the back, presumably because they were cut from a panel of just the length needed to obtain all the required elements with minimum wastage. On the side borders of the seat the warp runs vertically (like the front border), and is seamed about 12 cm from the back edge. On the side borders of the back the warp runs from front to back (like the top border). On the arm covers the warp runs from front to back in the top panel and vertically in the borders; the borders have a vertical seam on the outer face, near the back of the end scroll, and on the outside the border is lapped over the border of the chair-back (where the warp runs the opposite way). \n\nAll of the angled seams between two pieces of velvet, made to create the cover’s three-dimensional form (as opposed to the flat seams extending the fabric width), are articulated with welting (or piping) of a blue silk-covered cord. The welting was executed in the same process as seaming the velvet, not added afterwards: that is, the blue silk was folded over the cord and stitched in with the velvet in a single seam (two thicknesses of velvet and two of blue silk). This complex technique means that the three-dimensional covers must have been sewn together first – the back and seat cover as a single entity, like a loose cover (but without the outside-back piece) – and then fitted to the upholstered frame. The welting also runs around the arm-rests and arm-supports, where the back and seat panels are each seamed to a velvet fly, which is tucked in beside the stuffing. (This welting is treated differently on the two arm-supports: on the left arm the welting on top of the seat extends around the outside and front of the arm, and the arm is separately welted only around the inside and the back; on the right arm the separate welting is carried around three sides (all but the front), and the seat welting stops at the back of the arm.) In the crease between the back and the seat, a blue-green wool fly has been seamed to the velvet back panel, and another to the seat panel, the latter incorporating a line of welting (although this is never visible in use). The seat fly appears to be stitched to the back fly, and the back fly then nailed to the bottom rail of the back (on its bottom or back face), so pulling the back and seat covers tight into the crease. \n\nThe seat upholstery has a foundation of striped, plain-weave webbing (a pale brown warp with four dark stripes and a central off-white stripe, 4.5 cm wide) and an irregularly striped, broken-twill base cloth, both in linen and/or hemp. The stuffing of curled, undyed (black and white) horsehair is apparently contained by a single stuffing-cover, but this is not visible. The squared form of the seat is constructed by stitching into the upright borders of the stuffing-cover, as in a mattress, apparently in two rows (which can be felt through the velvet), to pack the horsehair out at the sides. This is an early form of stitched edge, superseded at the end of the eighteenth century by the method of stitching diagonally right through the pad, between the borders and the main panel, which produced a much firmer edge. Visible on the underside are three schemes of twine stitching: first, a line of widely spaced stitches around the front and sides (2 to 6.5 cm from the edge, and running diagonally inside the braces); these are probably stuffing-ties stitched up through the stuffing-cover to hold the stuffing in place; this would have been done before the mattress-stitching in the vertical borders. Secondly, in the middle of the seat, is a trail of much longer stitches, which correlate with the positions of the quilted indents on the top of the seat. These were evidently stitched through the stuffing-cover before the top cover was fitted. Thirdly, a trail in blue twine follows almost exactly the same course in the quilting as the second trail. This stitching was taken through the velvet top cover, after the cover had been nailed to the frame. It is pulled very tight, so reducing the tension on the first line of quilting stitches (or possibly those have loosened in part because of the nature of the twine). Despite the tension of the blue stitching, there are no tufts in the quilted indents of this chair to protect the top cover, which has in fact survived without tearing at these points. At the inner face of each arm-support, loose flaps of linen (in the stuffing-cover) and velvet (in the top cover), seamed to their respective top panels, are stitched together and then pushed down between the arm-support and the stuffing. The close nailing was probably the final stage in the upholstery, or it could have been done before the blue quilting stitches. \n\nThe upholstery of the back replicates that of the seat in most respects, except that the foundation may consist of a base cloth alone, with no webbing, and above the arms there appears to be only one row of mattress-stitching; there may be two rows underneath the arms. The blue-green wool outside-back panel was nailed to the frame over the velvet cover, these plain hand-cut nails then concealed by the close-set domed brass nails. At the bottom this cover is folded away on the back face of the legs, and nailed to the underside of the back seat rail. \n\nThe arm pads appear to be formed with two rows of mattress-stitching. The underside of the arms is covered with a hemp or linen canvas, fixed (presumably nailed to the sides) before the velvet top cover (and perhaps before the stuffing-cover). The velvet is oversewn to the canvas with double-twine, so it may be fixed to the frame solely by the decorative brass nails (with no plain tacks). \n\n<u>Condition</u> \nThere is some wear to the velvet pile, and to the linen ground, especially at the front of the seat and on the right arm-end, where the floating pile threads are exposed. \n\nMuch of the silk on the welting has worn away, exposing the buff-coloured cord, though more of the silk survives where it has been protected between the cord and the velvet. On the top front edge of the seat the cord itself is almost entirely missing.",Edge

"The Torah, that is the five books of Moses - Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers and Deuteronomy - and the Law they contain, emanate from God. This is the Word of God revealed to the Israelites and recorded in the Scriptures. The most dominant feature of a synagogue is the Ark of the Law in which the Torah scrolls are kept. Immediately in front of it is the reading-desk (or almemor) on which the scrolls of the Torah are placed to be read; the reading-desk is covered with a decorative cloth. \n\nThis almemor cloth has an embroidered panel 27"" long by 48"" wide.  Although it is not dated, the woven silk surrounding dates from the late 17th century. The greater part of the embroidery is worked with floss silk in brick stitch on a plainweave linen ground which had been extensively pieced together before being embroidered. The black inscriptions and the outlines of the motifs are corroding. Technically the embroidery is relatively complex: there is metal thread in certain areas, some  silk couched over white silk padding and French knots in the centre of flowers. \n\nVases of flowers had no intentional symbolic meaning, although some people might see them as representations of fertility and abundance.  But other images on this cloth were deliberately chosen for their symbolism. The central features are the tablets on which the first word of each of the Ten Commandments is written, representing God's revelation to the Israelites, small hillocks represent Mount Sinai on which there are tongues of fire and above everything is the cloud from which God spoke. Unleavened bread to the right is a symbol of the Passover and to the left are bitter herbs. The inscriptions are from the Book of Proverbs (chapter iii verses 16 and 18) and refer, in this context, to the importance of the Torah scroll: ""Length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honour.  She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her"". The wooden rollers on which the scrolls were wound were called trees of life. \n\nOne striking features of Jewish embroideries from North Italy is that most were embroidered by women. There are many known examples - one Ark curtain in the Jewish Museum in New York is dated 1680; it is from Venice and was embroidered by Simah, wife of Manahem Levi Meshullami, a member of a wealthy and prosperous family.  Another older curtain, dated 1630, was worked by the wife of the donor for a synagogue in Ancona and a binder for the Torah scrolls was embroidered by Rikah Polacco in 1662.\n\nThe Significance of Such Textiles:\nWhat was the ceremonial significance of elaborately decorated synagogue hangings?  Jews living under Christian rule were never secure enough to enable them to build large synagogues to rival cathedrals and churches.  Their synagogues were modest and unassuming from the outside - although their location was discreet, the decoration of the inside of the building and its furnishings was often opulent, attesting to the prosperity of the worshippers.  A reasonably prosperous synagogue would possess several Ark curtains and reading-desk covers and the ones used would be chosen to compliment the season, or the feast or the occasion, for example, a marriage. \n\nThis cover probably came from Venice. The city was a relatively secure place for Jews in the 17th century. In the previous century all Jews had been expelled from Southern Italy; Rome and Ancona were the only places within the Papal States where they could live; in Tuscany Jews could live only in Pisa.  But in Northern Italy they were able to live in a number of places and, except for occasional incidents, the Jewish communities there possessed enough stability and security to enable them to create beautiful works of art. \n\nColourful embroideries fulfilled two distinct functions. They created a decorative background, much as painted and mosaic patterns did in churches and tile-work did in mosques.  They were used primarily for aesthetic purposes to create a beautiful environment and by doing so they gave pleasure and joy to the people who had gathered for worship.  They enhanced the rituals. In a more subtle way, by using images which recalled specific instances where God had helped his people - guiding them, giving them victory, forgiving them - the worshippers could re-live positive spiritual experiences of personal and national redemption. \n\nThey reinforced good feelings about themselves as Jews and as a community and they gave them hope.  The congregation was reminded that ""they were adopted as sons, they were given the glory and the covenants, the Law and the ritual were drawn up for them and the promises were made to them.""   In a world of discrimination and active persecution, this positive feedback was necessary for their continued survival.  And so these beautiful embroideries were often more than decoration, they were a statement of identity, instilling  confidence and hope when they were most needed. [08/08/2000]",Edge

"British Galleries:\nEMBROIDERED MIRROR FRAME AND UNFINISHED FRAME<br>\nFrom about 1660 to 1680 a popular activity for amateur needlewomen was the embroidery of frames for mirrors. The maker may have drawn out the motifs herself, or bought a ready-drawn panel. The unfinished panel shows that the maker had worked some areas in great detail before starting on new motifs.

"Five wool embroidered satin panels forming a large, folding, gilt framed screen.\n\nThe ground of each panel is a coarse, warp faced dull gold satin with a brown cotton weft. Flat stitch embroidery is carried out in crewel wools, mainly in long and short, chain, twisted chain, satin, stem, couching and running stitches with the occasional French knot and more complex filling. The overall colour impression is of a rich brown, gold and silver with details in numerous colours and shades including yellow, red, pink, green, blue, cream and white.\n\nThe design is derived from grotesque ornament. Common to each panel is a central pillar enclosed by large floral and foliate arabesques and cornucopias on which various creatures (confronted or addorsed regardant) perch. The pillars on panels one, three and five are of a simple, almost Doric-like order wound with snakes and born on the backs of three squatting frogs or toads. The second and fourth screen panels have more florid Corinthian-like columns. There are slight variations in detail, but all pillars are broken at intervals by basins filled with pineapples, pomegranates and other fruits.\n\nAlong the bottom of each panel are lines in ancient Greek from Theocritus (Idyll XV, lines 78-83) in brown crewel wool couching on narrow strips of natural linen applied to the satin ground.\n\nThe panels are edged by glued on white silk braid, doubled at the top and bottom of each panel.

This removable cover is kept in place by a series of eyelet holes which hook over metal pegs fitted to the seat rails. Some of the chairs in the set of which this one is a part retain fragmentary evidence of their original silk 'scarves' - silk flaps that hung from the top edge of the back, normally out of sight behind the chairs, but which could be folded over to protect the front of the chair-back when in use. While these protective 'scarves' are mentioned in archival sources, these chairs are the only instance so far identified of surviving evidence of them. \n\nThe structural upholstery is of linen webbing, linen (ticking) base cloth, horsehair stuffing, and linen stuffing-covers. The webbing and base cloth is visible only in the seat. \n\nThe legs and seat facings are of oil-gilded walnut. In carved areas, the oil gilding has been applied as a layer of ochre-coloured oil or paint brushed directly onto the wood, with gold leaf laid on top. The sanded areas of the frame are gilded over a 'sanded' ground. Coarse sand was laid onto the wooden surface of the chair frame as the first stage of gilding; layers of ochre-coloured paint or oil, followed by gold leaf, were then applied on top of the sand. The use of a sanded ground is unusual on gilded chairs but became common in the 1720s on gilded picture and mirror frames, primarily those made in a William Kent style. On this set of chairs, the contrast between the smooth gilded surface of the carved sections and the duller matt finish of the sanded ground works to throw up the elaborate ornament of the carving. \n\nThe use of oil rather than water gilding is unusual in a set of furniture as grand as this one. It is likely that oil gilding was used to relate the chairs to the architectural gilding used elsewhere in the room, which used the same technique.\n\nThere have been some later changes to the surface of the chair. Small areas of both carved and sanded wood have been over-painted with bronze paint. In some areas, there is a second layer of sanding which is lifting off the chair. This second layer is found mainly over joints on the chair, and suggests areas where repairs have been made to cover opened cracks in the joints.",Edge

The embroidery is based on designs from pattern books, herbals and emblem books. It is of a very high quality and probably professional work.

"The dress is made from white silk woven with a narrow and a slightly broader satin stripe and figured with small floral sprigs. The bodice is lined with cotton and the sleeves are lined with stiffened cotton net. The bodice has a wide shallow neckline, short puff sleeves and a slightly raised waistline extending into a 'V' at the centre front. The bodice is cut with a front panel, shaped with bust darts from the waist, two side panels and two back panels. It fastens at the centre back with a narrow cotton tape at the waist and five metal hooks and eyes.

The neckline, sleeve ends and waistline are piped with gold-coloured satin; the same fabric, arranged into narrow pleated bands and placed to reflect the shape of the bodice, is applied to the centre front; similar bands are applied vertically to the back of the bodice on either side of the fastenings. The sleeves are trimmed with white satin ribbon shaped into V-shaped petals; the same ribbon shapes, arranged in two tiers,  are used to decorate  the lower part of the skirt above a broad band of gold satin.

"Chasuble of raised needle lace mounted on slightly watered plain woven red silk. The lace is mostly in the typical scrolling floral pattern of Venetian raised needle lace, separated by narrow vertical and horizontal bands with flower heads defiing the construction of the chasuble, particularly around the V shaped neck. The lace has not been worked to shape for the chasuble, but its design shows symmetrical repeating blocks, whose motifs have been slightly manipulated in places. It is likely that the lace was mounted onto the red silk ground shortly before its purchase by the Museum in 1870, and that the 17th century lace was modified, repaired and augmented slightly then. The narrow outer edging matches that on the other pieces of the set, and is likely to be 19th century.",Lace

"A man’s coat and breeches of lilac woollen broadcloth.  The coat has a ⅞-inch (1.8 cm) standing collar, and curving two-piece sleeves ending in a 3¾-inch (8.5 cm) cuff.  The fronts curve from neck to hem with pleats 5¼-inch (8.3 cm) deep, below the hip set at the side back.  Each front has a pocket with scalloped pocket flap; the centre-back seam is open below the hip.  The coat is lined with dark green silk satin, the sleeves and pockets with bleached linen.  There are 8 mother-of-pearl buttons, set with silver-gilt and green glass paste, arranged in pairs along the right front.  Beside each is an applied decoration – a narrow strip of leather embroidered with green and red foil spangles and silver purl.  At the end of each is a tassel of silver frisé, thread and spangles.  The same decoration is arranged in pairs along the left front.  The top 4 buttonholes have been cut but not worked. There are 3 buttons below each pocket with corresponding decoration on the pocket flaps, and 3 on each cuff.  Three buttons adorn the pleats, 1 at the hem, 1 half-way up; the 1 at the top has a tassel on each side. \n\nThe breeches comprise 2 fronts, two backs and 2 waistbands, made of lilac woollen broadcloth.

"This whole entry is being amended. No longer applicable. (8/7/14)\n<u>Design</u> \nA large, carved and painted-but formerly gilded-armchair, with stuffed back, seat and arm pads. The frame is boldly carved all over with C-scrolls, rocailles, cabochons, flowers, foliage and other rococo ornament. The serpentine-sided, round-cornered back is raised on struts above the serpentine-fronted, slightly canted seat, which has scrolling aprons merging in profile with cabriole legs that end in scroll feet. The back and seat are linked by carved open arms, each arm support rising from a large C-scroll in the side rail and mirroring the form of the front legs. The frame is painted yellow with details picked out in green and the flowers in red, this scheme introduced in 1968. The chair is covered in yellow plain-weave silk, trimmed on the back and seat with a wide woven cotton(?) braid, dating from 1968-70.\n\nThe chair-back is carved on the front face with rocailles, acanthus scrolls and flowers, centring on a cartouche of decorated C- and S-scrolls at the top, and one of smaller scrolls with cabochons at the bottom, the supporting struts formed as bead-spined acanthus sprays. Similar rocailles are carved on the seat-frame, the front rail centring on an apron cartouche of further decorated C-scrolls, echoing the top rail. Each of the side rails is carved in the front two-thirds with two nearly abutting C-scrolls-the front scroll merging in outline with the front leg, the larger one behind merging with the arm-support. Above the scroll the arm support is carved with a flame-like motif and at front and back of each arm rest are pairs of leafy C-scrolls. Each of the front legs is carved at the knee with a rocaille-framed, heart-shaped cabochon; each of the back legs, with a C-scroll-framed shell; and all four legs have a ruffled moulding descending to the foot, which ends in a foliate scroll raised on a shallow plinth. The back seat rail, like the back third of each side rail, has moulded edges but almost no carving, except for a vivacious central rocaille scroll with acanthus-scroll lower border. The back-frame above this is entirely plain.\n\n<u>Construction</u> \nThe chair appears to be made of beech throughout, and the front seat rail is pieced out in the apron. The four seat rails are tenoned and double-pegged to the front legs and the full-height back uprights. The four seat rails and both rails of the chair back are tenoned and double-pegged to the front legs and the full-height back uprights (except that the bottom rail of the chair-back appears not to be pegged). The arm-supports are tenoned and double-pegged to the seat rails, and perhaps pegged singly to the arm-rests. Each arm-rest is housed in the front face of the back upright at almost full section (slightly rebated at top and bottom but not at the sides), and tenoned in and pegged, singly, behind the housing. At the joints of the top rail, the through-pegs can be seen to be tapered, being larger in diameter at the front than the back; probably the same technique is used throughout. The front leg joints are now reinforced with blocks glued and nailed in the inside angles with the seat rails.\n\nThe present paint is applied over a single scheme of matt and burnished gilding, which has been revealed on the back right leg where some of the paint has been removed. This is executed in water gilding, or possibly a combination of oil and water gilding for the matt and burnished areas respectively.(1)\n\n<u>Upholstery</u> \nThe upholstery is entirely modern, at least in the seat. This has a foundation of jute close-webbing (with three narrow stripes), which appears to date from the early twentieth century and, on top, a jute base cloth that, together with all the materials above it, probably dates from 1968 when the chair was re-covered (see below). The seat is stuffed primarily with vegetable fibre, secured with loosely woven jute and apparently constructed with a stitched edge on all four sides (with just one row of top stitching); on top of this is a thin layer of vegetable fibre and horsehair, secured with fine linen, and then a layer of cotton wadding beneath the yellow silk top cover.(2) The back of the chair is covered on the back face, immediately behind the foundation, in the same yellow silk as is the front and must, therefore, have been reupholstered at the same time. It appears to be skate stuffed, but all the internal materials are concealed.\n\nThere are numerous tack holes on the back uprights and arm-supports, at and just above the level of the seat, from which the original form of the upholstery can be tentatively reconstructed. The holes on the front face of the arm supports suggest that originally the dome of the seat was slightly higher at the front than now. On the back uprights there are holes on the completely plain flat face behind the seat, indicating that the seat cover was taken around these uprights. Only by doing this, or by fixing blocks to the front and inner squared faces of the legs, could the upholsterer have avoided exposing flat spandrel-shaped areas of wood, as now, at the top of these faces-an unresolved treatment that cannot have been adopted originally.\n\nOn the underside of the seat rails are clusters of tack-holes suggesting that at one time the seat has been sprung. There are also remnants of a thin linen bottoming cloth, fixed nearer to the outer edge than the cloth used to support the springs (and too light to take the strain of springing).\n\n<u>Notes</u> \n1. A cross-section of a burnished area taken in 2009 yielded thick gesso, red bole, water gilding, gesso or a gesso-like layer, and yellow paint. A cross-section of a matt area (on the side of the foot) yielded gesso, several layers of gilding intermixed possibly with an oil mordant (no bole), yellow paint, and varnish. Overtly this suggests that the matt areas are oil-gilt, but the intermixed areas could alternatively be a rather careless treatment of water gilding.\n\n2. These layers can be seen where the top cover and linen stuffing-cover have been unpicked at the left end of the back seat rail. There is a conspicuous row of large stitches in the underside of the webbing, behind the front seat rail; how (or whether) this relates to the present upholstery construction is unclear.",Ear

"Chair of carved and gilt walnut, with seat of serpentine form and square back, the legs carved as quivers filled with arrows, the top seat rail with an unstrung bow and a wreath, with myrtle. \n\nThe legs (those at the back slightly raked) support an upholstered seat with serpentine side rails and bowed front rail. Outset blocks above each leg are carved with recessed panels set with squared rosettes; between these the top edges of the seat rails are beaded, above a recessed panel carved with swags of flowers, including roses, suspended with ribbons from the top frame of the recessed panel and, in the centre of the front, formed as a wreath hanging from the beading. The back is raised on short uprights, the side and front faces carved with lambrequins and tassels; above these, outset blocks are carved with opposed foliage cups, between which the lower rail of the back is carved with a recessed panel set with four small swags of flowers.  The back uprights are in the form of fluted shafts, each rising from a cup of upright leaf ornament, and enriched at the top with trails of bell flowers in alternate flutes. A deep, plain collar at the top of each shaft flanks the top rail, which is carved with beading on the lower edge and with two branches of myrtle, the stalks bound together by a tasseled cord, within a central wreath of myrtle, all on a recessed panel.  The uprights are each set with a pomegranate finial, bursting to show the seeds.  Between these the pierced cresting shows the unstrung bow and a central wreath of roses. \n\nThe chair is of mortise and tenon construction, the seat rails tenoned into the blocks at the top of the legs, the back rails tenoned between the uprights.

"Semi-circular garment made up of widths of deep red silk velvet seamed together; a contrasting embroidered orphrey band is stitched along the opening, and a non-functional embroidered hood is attached centre-back at the neck. The velvet is of the type usually described as <i>ferronerie</i>, because the pomegranate pattern is delineated by a fine outline thought to imitate ironwork. Four full widths of velvet and two three-quarter widths make up the garment, the two central widths are intact, the other panels reveal how carefully this costly textile was used as the outer edges that form the circle have been pieced together from a number of small pieces. A deep fringe is attached round the semi-circular side - probably a later addition although such fringes were used in the Middle Ages. The whole of the cope is lined with deep blue linen (in excellent condition) - also pieced together.\n\n<i>The orphrey bands</i> are embroidered with images of saints (see below), in coloured silks (blue, green, red and brown) and gold thread (Cologne work); there is evidence that originally sequins were sewn on to the blue background embroidery: a few sequins have survived on images of St Lucy and St Severinus, and the reddish thread that attached them to these and other parts of the embroidery is visible against the blue in all cases. The faces of the saints are stitched in white, but the features seem to have been drawn on below the surface (possibly a similar technique to that used as in Butler Bowdon cope). There is also evidence of restoration work executed in white thread, couched down, especially on the right hand side (when worn). A fine yellow braid/ribbon is sewn over the edges of the ophreys on both sides. It dates to either the late 19th or early 20th century.\n\n<i>The hood</i> is of couched gold thread, with figures representing the Death of the Virgin Mary and is very worn. The draperies were originally of gold threads, whipped round with fine coloured silks; the heads of the various figures are of canvas embroidered with fine silks in long and short stitches. A narrow red and white fringe is sewn around the hood. It is lined with blue linen, a shade lighter than the lining of the rest of the cope.\n\n<i>Iconography</i>.  The figures depicted on the orphreys are saints who each inhabit a similar space, placed below a castellated wall, under a decorative Gothic arch, they stand on a tesselated floor; below the floor, in Latin, is the inscription bearing the appropriate name. When the cope was on the clergyman's body, the saints faced each other across the opening: from bottom to top, St John the Baptist faced St Hubert, St Ursula faced St Lucy, St Severinus faced St Bernadino and Saint Elizabeth faced St Mary Magdalene. The textiles worn by the saints (as long flowing robes) echo the pattern found on the velvet of the cope - large, abstract pomegranate designs. Each saint carries the appropriate indicator of status and attribute: the bishops Severinus and Hubert wear mitres and carry croziers, those of royal lineage, Ursula and Elizabeth (of Hungary) wear crowns, the martyrs, Ursula and Lucy carry palm fronds. Mary Magdalen is depicted with long flowing tresses, holding a vase of ointment; Elizabeth holding a garment (no doubt an allusion to those she made for those in need). \n\nThe hood shows the death of the Virgin. She lies in a rectilinear bed in a room with a window on the left hand side above the bed. Round the bed are twelve male figures with haloes round their heads. Eleven are bald and bearded, the twelfth is clean-shaven and has a full head of hair. He is holding a jar (?). He and two other saints in the group are behind the bed, looking towards the Virgin; one of them holds a palm branch. To their right is another group whose attention is focussed on an object that looks like an incense burner. In front of the bed side two saints looking at a book, and to their right is another saint with a book who looks as if he is reading to the assembled crowd.  Only the faces, hands and hair of the saints is executed in silk (much worn); the rest of the embroidery (draperies, bed, background) is in different metal threads (the Virgin's robes, sheet and pillow, probably in silver-gilt; the saints'/apostles' garments, bed, bedcover, background) in gold. The metal threads are couched down, the background using a red silk, and creating a geometric diaper pattern. The ground is badly worn, so much of the brownish linen base textile is visible. The haloes are worked in a succession of curving rays, which shows up the gold to great advantage. A shield has been applied centre bottom of the hood; it is divided in half, the left blue with two silver cylinders, the right red with a gold band at the top and two gold chevrons over the red. Round the edge of the hood is a half-inch band of brick stitch embroidery in metal thread, and attached round the outer edge of that band is a narrow braid in red and white (half-inch), ending in a fringe.",strip

"A woman's court mantua composed of mantua and petticoat of dark pink ribbed silk, embroidered to shape with silver thread, strip, frisé, purl and spangles in a large Tree-of-Life design.  The mantua is open at the front with double-pleated robings to the waist and elbow-length sleeves with deep, pleated cuffs.  The back is made of one width of the silk, pleated and shaped to form the back of the bodice and extending into the train.  On either side of it, below the waist, is a tapering rectangle made of 3 pieces of silk, to form the gathering of the mantua at the back.  The upper piece also forms the bodice fronts, one pleat of the robings extending into one of the pleats at the back. The bodice is lined with linen.  On the side seams below the waist on the inside are two loops of silver cord, with corresponding silver buttons on the right side, for draping the mantua.  The mantua is embroidered to shape, the bodice, sleeves and cuffs, worked  and scaled to accommodate their pleats and shaping.  The train and its side panels are worked on the wrong side (relative to the bodice), but to show correctly when the mantua is properly arranged.  \n\nThe petticoat is made of 7 widths of silk, embroidered over 6 seams, with the final seam after embroidery at the right back.  There is an opening in the middle of the centre back panel.  The petticoat is lined with red silk taffeta and the hem bound with a woven silver lace (braid).  Its original shape was probably for a wide, square hoop.  It is embroidered in a symmetrical Tree-of-Life design with scrolling stems and large  leaves originating from a dense swag and lattice border at hem, pattern opening up as it reaches the  top.  Some embroidery done originally in coloured silks, then covered over with silver thread.\n\nThe mantua was altered for fancy dress in the 1920s.
