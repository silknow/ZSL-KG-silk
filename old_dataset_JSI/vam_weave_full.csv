"Piece of embroidery, part of a valance made up of a number of distinct sections with self-contained designs. The ground of the textile is red silk in a satin weave (eight shaft). The embroidery silks comprise three shades of pink, three of green, three of blue, two of yellow, and brown, and the motifs are executed in split, stem and chain stitches, some laid and couched work.

On the left, the man gestures towards the urn and the words 'SAT CITO'. On the right, the woman gestures towards the urn and the words 'SI SAT BENE'. The man wears a tunic, hose and buskins; the woman a gown with open hanging sleeves, through which her arms stretch out, thus revealing the contrasting tight-fitting sleeves of an undergarment. Above and below this central motif, the patterning is symmetrical about a vertical axis: above, the design has two distinct levels, the first composed of garlands of bunches of fruit, while, in the second two stylised containers of fruit with leaves (apples?) flank a decorative sun-burst. Below the central motif, swags of drapery flank a female mask.

"Front of a square corporal case, red silk embroidered in silver-gilt thread, and coloured silks, probably made in Italy, 16th century",satin
"Front of a square corporal case, made of red silk in a satin weave, embroidered in silver-gilt thread, blue, green and yellow silks, and glued to a backing of white linen in a plain weave. The embroidery is executed to fit the square shape, with two lines of couched thread outlining the outer edge and creating a border in which are embroidered S-shaped scrolls in green and yellow; in the box in the centre (similarly outlined) is the Sacred Monogram IHS (above the cross-bar of the H is a cross on a mound); around this box is a symmetrical pattern of stylised flowers/vases (fleur de lys at the corners?).Couching, long and short stitch and satin stitch are used; some of the silver-gilt threads are laid over a padding of some description which gives the motif a raised effect.\n\nThe edges are raw and fraying slightly, suggesting the piece was from its original object; on the lower left edge remains a small fragment of the silver gilt braid that originally surrounded the outermost edge of the case. There are spots of wax on the surface of the silk.",satin
"Cream silk satin mitre, lined with cream taffeta and embroidered with coloured silks and metallic thread. Design in moderate grotesque style, around a central motif of hands clutching palm branches (suggestive of Christian martyrdom). Probably early 16th century, Italian.",satin
"Mitre with two lappets; exterior of white satin, embroidered in coloured silks and gold thread; interior skull cap, lining of mitre peak and of lappets in cream taffeta (badly damaged in the case of the skull cap and lappets); a layer of strengthening that supports the embroidery is visible through the damaged taffeta lining and comprises heavy printed paper, probably pages from a book. The outer layer of the back and front of the mitre and the outer edge of the lappets are ornamented with embroidery in an apparently secular pattern of closely arranged acanthus scrolls, supported by winged, naked cherubs; birds rest on the leaves. The pattern is symmetrical about a vertical axis, with the central motif being a pair of disembodied hands holding palm branches (usually the symbol of martyrs) and surmounted by a coronet whose spiked points end in fleurs de lys.  The rest of the composition is built out from this central motif and is light-hearted in feel, a simple form of the grotesque style. The outer edge of the mitre is outlined with a plaited tress of metallic threads.\n\nThe silk embroidery threads are used to create clever, naturalistic shading through the use of long and short stitch, satin stitch and chain stitch in two shades of blue, two of pink, two of green, yellow; black is used for eyes and noses. Gold thread is couched down; in the case of the birds, the couching thread is black.\n\nThrough the shattered lining it is possible to see printed pages of paper, which act as stiffening inside the mitre; some of the text is in Spanish, some in Latin. See Curator's note.",satin

"Rigid apparel of embroidered brownish red silk velvet bordered with a band of yellow silk satin (1 inch in width), and edged with a narrow black and brown silk braid. The red velvet bears a strong image created through the application of silk satin and couched cord: a skull and cross-bones dominates the centre of the panel and is surrounded by decorative scrollwork. The applique white satin is tinted or painted in black and grey on the skull and elsewhere in blue and red. The applique of yellow satin in blue (which creates areas of green). The applique satin is outlined in a couched yellow and white cord, and certain elements of the design are emphasised by the use of a similar couched outline, such as the teeth on the skull. In the centre of the skull there are needle or pin holes that suggest it may have been stitched to something at one point (they form a zig zag shape). Drips of, possibly, candle wax have dried on the surface of the panel.\n\nThe panel is backed with coarse undyed, probably, linen in a plain weave, and possibly glued to the silk (to go by the rigidity of the piece) although a few stray thread ends on the back suggest that some of the stitching was executed after the linen was put in place.",satin

The upholstered panels of seat, back and sides are currently covered in yellow silk satin, edged with gimp. \n\n<u>Design</u>\nThe design is severely neo-classical, with all elements of the back and arms outlined with frames of giltwood carved with <i>piastre</i> (a motif of overlapping circles), the joints between verticals and horizontals each set with a circular <i>paterae</i>, those at the top front of the arm supports ovals. The back and arms are supported on four short, gilded balusters, leaf-wrapped. The seat rail is decorated on the vertical edge with a continuous band of laurel, the centre of the front set with a tablet carved with a reclinging figure of a draped woman, gesturing towards a rectangle that may be a mirror.

The straight, inner front rail is made of a single board. \n\nFrom underneath, it is clear that four small boards have been nailed to the top of the rails at each corner.  These are approximately 1 cm thick.  They create the flat platform around each of the baluster-shaped supports, behind the edge moulding of the seat. \n\nUnderneath the seat rails you can see that the fillets on the front edge have been added and it is possible that all the fillets are such additions. The carved decioration, apart from the fluting, is cast in composition and applied.  The characteristic cracking across lines of ornament is visible in several places.  \n\n<u>Upholstery</u>\nThe chair retains old webbing, approximately 5 cm wide, that may be its original webbing. This is open set in a fan-shaped pattern to follow the shape of the seat. Above it a linen base cloth is visible, with stuffing ties.  The upholstery of the seat must be built on a separate wooden frame (which can be felt at the edges of the pad) and tacked into place on the chair frame, the tacks hidden by gimp.",satin
