"A woman's sack of deep pink silk damask in a large scale point repeat pattern of fantastic fruits and flowers.

The back has two, double box pleats stitched at the neckline.   The sack is made of 6 widths of silk, with a waistseam extending from the front edges to the bodice side-back seam.  The skirts are pleated at the side seams on either side of the pocket openings. \n\nThe sack, with a matching petticoat,  was possibly made in the 1740s with the deep pleated cuffs and the robings to the hem; some of the piecing at the back may be part of the original construction.  In the early 1760s, it was altered, probably for another wearer.  A waist seam was added, the back re-pleated and the skirts reconfigured for a narrower hoop.  The scalloped, pinked ruching on the sleeve cuffs was possibly added at this time.\n\nIn the late 19th century, the sack was altered for fancy dress.  The front panel of a matching petticoat was added to the front of the sack, and the hem faced with white satin.  The robings below the waist were unpicked and the pinked and scalloped ruching (possbily removed from the petticoat) was added to each side of the front.",weaving_technique

"Firescreen, of trestle form, in frame of carved and gessoed wood, now oil gilded, the panel set with a panel of tapestry woven with a scene from Aesop's fables, showing a dog looking at his reflection in water.\nThe frame is raised on out-turned pairs of feet, moulded and carved with double C-scrolls that end in up-turned scrolls. Low struts, rising from above each pair of feet and carved with scrolling foliage, support the main frame, which is also carved with long scrolls, decorated at the base, on the upper half of each side and on the cresting with flowers, leaves and scrolls. There is some piercing in the carving at the shoulders, the centre of the sides and the middle of the lower rail.  The cresting is carved with a large, cushioned, cartouche, with leafy decoration. \nThe ornament all over the back of the frame is much simpler. \nThe front is set with a panel of tapestry in polychrome within a reserve against a crimson ground.  The reserve is woven with a trompe l'oeil frame looking like carved giltwood surrounding a scene of a dog looking at its relection in water. The tapestry is outlined with gimp woven in red, blue and white. \nThe frame is constructed with the side pieces running full height, the top and bottom rails tenoned into them.  The four feet are tenoned into either side of the base of the stiles.  The joints are disguised by carving and are not immediately visible. \nThe back of the frame is lined with crimson silk damask.  It is not possible to see any significatnt amount of the pattern but it is a large repeat, of a leafy, formal plant pattern of the kind popular in the mid-18th century.  The visible width of the silk is 54 cm in the centre, suggesting that it is in fact an 18th-century silk. The pattern is not matched at the seams and these appear to be hand-stitched, suggesting that it was re-used before about 1850.",weaving_technique

Each loom width comprises one band of the background colour. The damask was always thought to be Chinese and the bedcover was purchased on this basis.  However, it now seems likely to be European (perhaps northern European) because the technical features of the damask seem to mark it out as such.  The key to understanding why it was originally thought to be Chinese is in a seminal article by George Wingfield Digby in The Burlington Magazine, LXXVII, 1940, 52-63 and the reason why there are now doubts as to its Chinese provenance lie in the textile analysis work of Milton Sonday, see his article in the Abegg Foundation publication, Riggisberger Berichte, volume 7, ' Linen Damasks: Centres of Production and Collections'. On present evidence, the damask seems to be seventeenth century or later and the lining, passementerie and tassles, twentieth-century.",weaving_technique

The hem has a narrow facing of white silk taffeta.\n\nThe gown was probably first made in the late 1740s or 1750s; remaining pleats and the heavy piecing of the petticoat suggest it was possibly first a closed sack worn with a wide hoop.  In the 1760s, it was taken apart and remade into an English-style gown and petticoat.  In the late 19th century, the robings were unpicked for fancy dress and the blue linen tape ties fastening the bodice front replaced with undyed linen ties (two now missing).",weaving_technique

"Scroll of embroidered silk showing a willow tree, kingfisher and swallows\nis a typical example of the kind of fine embroidery work that enjoyed a flowering at this time. It depicts a willow tree with a peony flower growing at its base. Swallows, a kingfisher poised as if ready to dive and a pair of herons complete the composition. Like Chinese scroll paintings it probably would not have hung permanently on the wall, but was brought out at certain seasons and admired for a while. This type of picture is very much a part of the interior design scheme of a well off household. The challenges of creativity were rather differnrntly inflected in China before the twentieth century. The fact that it is painted with silk threads is evidence that it is not a slavish copy but rather a wholly acceptable way of honouring the original artist.",weaving_technique

"Piece of embroidery, part of a valance, silk satin weave embroidered in silks, probably embroidered in France, 1560s.",weaving_technique
"Piece of embroidery, part of a valance made up of a number of distinct sections with self-contained designs. The ground of the textile is red silk in a satin weave (eight shaft). The embroidery silks comprise three shades of pink, three of green, three of blue, two of yellow, and brown, and the motifs are executed in split, stem and chain stitches, some laid and couched work. Silver gilt braid has been sewn round the edges at a later date. The embroidery design is built out from a central composition which comprises two figures in vaguely classical dress kneeling on either side of an urn. On the left, the man gestures towards the urn and the words 'SAT CITO'. On the right, the woman gestures towards the urn and the words 'SI SAT BENE'. The man wears a tunic, hose and buskins; the woman a gown with open hanging sleeves, through which her arms stretch out, thus revealing the contrasting tight-fitting sleeves of an undergarment. Above and below this central motif, the patterning is symmetrical about a vertical axis: above, the design has two distinct levels, the first composed of garlands of bunches of fruit, while, in the second two stylised containers of fruit with leaves (apples?) flank a decorative sun-burst. Below the central motif, swags of drapery flank a female mask. The embroidery is completed round the edge by decorative stitching; there is a single rather than a double line of this stitching on the left hand side.\n\nThe ink outline is drawn on the satin to guide the embroiderer is still visible in places. Although the back of this object is not visible, from examination of one of the other three matching pieces (T.219A-1981) it is clear that the red satin was lined with undyed linen before the embroidery was executed. This extra layer would have prevented slippage and given more strength to the final product. T.219B-1981 and T.219C-1981 are both still mounted on white satin as they were when they entered the museum.",weaving_technique

On either side of it, below the waist, is a tapering rectangle made of 3 pieces of silk, to form the gathering of the mantua at the back.  The upper piece also forms the bodice fronts, one pleat of the robings extending into one of the pleats at the back. The bodice is lined with linen.  On the side seams below the waist on the inside are two loops of silver cord, with corresponding silver buttons on the right side, for draping the mantua.

Penden Lhamo, as her name is pronounced in Tibet, is the Tibetan equivalent of Shri Devi the fierce black Indian goddess and the only female member of the Eight Dharmapalas. Surrounded by an aureole of flames the dark blue goddess sits side saddle on her mule. She has staring eyes, a third eye blazing between her brows and wears a crown of five skulls. In her left hand she holds the skull of a child born of an incestuous union which is full of blood. As earrings she wears in her right ear a lion and in her left a snake. Copious blue and red scarves billow around her neck and shoulders while above her head there floats an umbrella of peacock feathers. She is clad in ornaments of human bone and wears a loincloth of tiger skins held up by a band of snakes through which is thrust a vajra-tipped club. The head of her flayed son together with his two arms are seen hanging over the mule beneath her. According to legend she was originally the wife of the demon king of Sri Lanka who vowed to either convert her husband and his people to Buddhism or kill her own son. Having failed she flayed her son alive and, taking this horrific form, used his skin to cover her mule. Mythology recounts how Lhamo received her accoutrements and weapons for the protection of the Dharma from the Gods. The crescent moon in her hair and sun disk at her navel were given by Vishnu while Hevajra gave her two dice, used to decide the good or bad fate of human beings, which hang over the front flank of her mount. Above them is a bag full of diseases that the goddess releases to destroy the enemies of religion. Her white mule is harnessed with poisonous snakes and a severed human head hangs from the snake rein. Hanging on the mules rump is a ball of coloured thread made from magically transformed weapons wound together. This form of the goddess lacks the garland of freshly severed heads that normally adorn Palden Lhamos body. Here she also rides over a yellow platform supported by lotuses flowers and a rock pedestal rather than the sea of foaming blood which is usually found.",weaving_technique

The square shawl is not part of the Chinese dress tradition, the shape being dictated purely by the needs of European fashion, where they were both items of clothing and features in interior decoration, being draped over tables and pianos as well as being pinned on walls. The workshops where the shawl silk was woven must have had specialized weavers to set up the very wide looms needed to produce the roughly square pieces without seaming the material.

"The State Bed from Melville House, Fife, Scotland. Oak and pine upholstered in crimson Genoa velvet and white Chinese silk damask embroidered with crimson silk braid, English, c.1700",weaving_technique
"The bedstead consists of an oak bedstock with four oak posts secured to the rails with bolts, the posts chamfered above the bottom rails to become octagonal. The frame of the bed retains its original ropes and and linen ticking (twill in the light areas and plain-weave elsewhere) which are attached to the side and foot stock rails and a tension baton at the head of the bed. This was originally tightened by bolts (now missing) through the head rail. It has subsequently been tightened by being folded over and refixed to the tension baton. The side edges of the linen ticking are strengthened with piping and attached to the side linen sections by ropes inserted through eyelet holes strengthened with linen thread.  The top of each post has two iron hooks to secure the curtain rods. The top of the posts hold iron spikes which  secure the tester and cornice. Each of the posts have silk damask covers lined with linen. The pine tester has a horizontal subframe with a hole at each corner which slots over the spikes on the top of the posts.  The pine cornice frame also slots over the spikes above the tester sub-frame and is separated from the latter by oak spacers which are now attached to the cornice frame. The tester consists of a pine structure of thick upright sides resting on the subframe. The sides support  six pierced coved sections built up in facetted boards to achieve a coved interior - one at each corner and one in the middle of each side. The corner sections are attached to the upright sides by nails. The middle sections are attached by pine boards, nailed to the pierced sections, with holes which slot over iron eyes set into the upright sides and anchored with nails slotted through these eyes.\n\nThe tester cloth is of a different cream Chinese silk to the bed curtain linings and counterpane. At the head selvedge is a Chinese inscription. The central cartouche is made with thick pine boards curved up (by steaming?) at each end, forming a large central oval. In the centre is a smaller oval stepped to overlap the outer and providing support for yet another smaller oval. Rings in the top of the main boards provide the means of attachment to the middle sections of the coving. Traces of pencil drawings on the underside of the tester cloth provided rough guidelines for the passementerie of  braid and fringe although these were not always followed.\n\nThe outer cornice of the upper framework is covered with crimson velvet with crimson fringe. The support six(?) coronets, a pair on each side and a pair at the foot end with at the corners four acanthus leaf scrolls.  Two iron cantoon arms on brackets are fixed to the cornice frame. These support velvet cantoons, which are stiffened with linen and have separate silk linings.  The cantoons are curved at the ends (gathered by long linen stitches) and fringed all round the edges.  The cantoons are tied up with cords with tassels at each end. The velvet upper outer valances are attached to the tester frame. The silk inner upper valances are attached to the inside of  the tester frame. \n\nThe head board similarly covered with cream silk and embellished with crimson silk braid and fringe supports a cresting of pierced acanthus plumage, and is embellished with the joint monogram of George, first Earl of Melville and his wife, Catherine. The outer scrolls support two Earl's coronets which are symbolic of  the patrons' noble status. \n\nAbove the headboard, the head curtain of silk damask is gathered in loose vertical folds accross the centre section. It is attached to the upper framework behind the inner valance at the top, the head posts at either side and behind the carved headboard at the bottom. It is embellished with two drapes consisting of gathered silk curtains edged with crimson fringe and lined with linen. The drapes have attachments at the upper and lower fixing points consisting of choux and tassels.\n\nThere are two foot curtains and two head curtains. The foot curtains are made of five panels of velvet 50 cms wide and one panel of 10 cm wide which was designed to fit round the corner with short fringe down its seam sand a longer fringe on the bottom edge. The linings are in widths of 69 cms. The curtains end approximately 18 cms from the floor. Both curtains have cords attached to the top ends with tassels at the ends for pulling the curtains along the rods.  The head curtains are made up of two 50 cm widths of velvet. The base valances are attached to the base rail and are in two sections. The upper section consists of a pine moulding to which braid and velvet are glued and nailed with fringes at the top and the bottom. The lower sections consists of a valance similar to the upper valances with swags, bells and tassels on cords. \n\nThe coverlet, a remarkable survival, is of silk damask embroidered with crimson braid and fringe. The central cartouche frames the Earl's monogram beneath an Earl's coronet with a pendant of simulated tasseled fringe embroidered in crimson braid. The outer borders of the coverlet are decorated with crimson fringe to form an effective edging where the counterpane is turned down to cover the sides and end of the bed. The coverlet has a specially shaped section to cover the bolster.",weaving_technique

"<b>Summary description:</b>\nA large armchair of carved walnut, stained dark brown, with theatrically scrolled fronts legs and arms,heavily raked back, the seat and back upholstered in red silk velvet with silk bell fringe (both upholstery modern).\n\n<b>Decorative Scheme:</b>\nThe armchair is designed to convey maximum impact to the viewer. The seat and back taper outwards towards the front and the top of the chair, emphasising the perspective and giving an enhanced sense of its enormous scale.  The upholstery is covered in modern red silk velvet, trimmed with scalloped bell fringing along the lower edge of the back and the lower edge of the seat rail, the shape of the trimming adding a sense of movement to these otherwise straight lines.  \n\nThe front legs, arms and arms supports are carved in the form of bold scrolls, moulded in section and transversally ribbed in the centre where they scroll over. The front legs are each formed as an S-scroll, as are the arms, which rest on supports that scroll outwards at the base and meet the back on what appears to be the outer edge of the upholstery of the back, thus increasing the visual breadth of the back. From the mid-height of the front legs, subsidiary scrolls form the outer edge of the front stretcher, meeting at a central cartouche with acanthus leaves wrapping the top edge. The front legs are additionally carved with what appears to be a lashing of scrollwork, as if the ends of the side stretchers were wrapped round the front legs.  The side stretchers are simpler in execution but also show scrolls meeting at the centre in a cartouche, the carving on the side stretchers carrying over onto the side faces of the back uprights. These, and the back stretcher are simply rectangular in section and are undecorated.\n\n<b>Structure and Materials\n</b>\nThe armchair is constructed of walnut throughout, dark-stained in those areas that are visible. The back uprights are continuous and the front legs continue up to form the arm supports.  The stretchers and seat rails are tenoned into the back uprights and the front legs. The arms supports are tenoned up into the underside of the arms and cut with a stepped joint, and the arms are tenoned into the back uprights. The arms scroll outwards at their top end and are built out so that the tenon into the back upright is disguised and the joint appears from the front to be beyond the side frame of the back. The scroll is set forward of the back upholstery by approximately 1 cm, which allows for the fixing of the upholstery. \n\nWhere extra elements of wood are required to accomodate the design of the carved scrolls, extra pieces have simply been glued on before carving, as in, for example, the scrolling front feets, which extend well beyond the legs, the scroll at the top of each arm, and the dpeth of carving in the upper half of the front stretcher. \n\nThe back is heavily raked above seat height. The back uprights show strong saw marks on the back surface. The back stretcher has been replaced.  The joint behind the left side must have broken awayin the past and the new stretcher is now inset into the recess, rather than tenoned in. The top rail and the bottom rail of the back panel are shallower than the back uprights and are tenoned into them close to the front edge. \n\nThe front and side seat rails have been extended with newer wood on their underside, making them deeper than the back rail and have also been reduced in thickness from the inside.  They are cross-veneered on the front surfaces with walnut.  This may have been done at the time of the upholstery that was on the chair in 1856 and may have been done to disguise the areas at the corner of the chair where the uprights might show through the corners, which were only joined by hook-and-eye fastenings. The back corners of the seat have been reinforced underneath with blocks, cut with serpentine curves on their inner faces. \n\nThe surviving upholstery webbing is set in open format, with two lateral webs and three running front to back. It shows two different widths, the front lateral web being narrower than all the others but all seem to have been attached at the same time, with hand-made tacks over narrow strips of leather (probably dating from the late 17th century). All the upholstery above the webbing has been renewed (2011).  In 1968 it was believed that the surviving upholstery from 1856 was the original but, although the fringing may have survived from that date, the velvet and lining appear to be of the 19th century.  There are too many tack holes to suggest only two upholstery schemes before the current one and it is likely that the pre-1856 scheme was done in the early nineteenth century (possibly 1820-40)",weaving_technique

Green and red silk with polychrome woven velvet pile and gold thread design; probably Italian; 1400s; pomegranate (thistle) pattern,weaving_technique
"Two 10cm-wide pieces of woven silk with velvet and gold thread pattern. Each piece is a mirror image of the other, presumably taken from two opposite ends of the same length of material. They have been stitched together down the selvedges to create a symmetrical whole. It cannot be said whether the seam is contemporary to the age of the velvet; but it was done before 1864 as the original collector’s label (predating V&A acquisition) is stuck over the seam. The selvedges are green and white. The base fabric is a grass green silk, with an elaborate pattern in wine velvet. The centre motif in the sample is a pomegranate (or thistle), outlined in dark emerald green, filled in with gold, and having wine red seeds. It is surrounded by gold  leaves, and green flowers, set upon a wine velvet trefoil shape. Elements of the design are filled in with white velvet pile, which is now worn quite thin.  There is a flaring trumpet shape emerging from the top of the pomegranate motif; this is why the design could represent a thistle rather than a pomegranate. The pomegranate (or thistle) is set into a large trefoil-shaped medallion, which in its turn is surrounded by foliage, flowers, and white velvet grapes. The full pattern of the repeat is not discernible as the piece of fabric has been cut to focus upon the pomegranate-in-trefoil centre motif, so the foliage surrounding it is only partially visible.",weaving_technique

The carved beech frame has pierced, tapered legs carved with foliage and lambrequins, joined by scrolling X-form stretchers which meet at a central vase finial. The valance is fitted to an upholstered lip on all four sides, within which the cushion, of boxed construction, sits. The gilding of the frame has been renewed. \nThe cushion has a central rectangular pane of a green-ground silk velvet, with mitred borders of an orange-ground silk textile (almost certainly also velvet), now very degraded (especially the orange borders). This sits within wider borders of a later red velvet, which are also mitred, and the vertical box panels are of the same red velvet. The horizontal seam betwen the top borders and the upright borders is concealed by a wide braid, and the upright and mitred seams were formerly covered by narrow braid, now missing (but which survives in part on the companion stool, W.14-2009). The trimmings on this cushion differ from those on the companion stool, and neither precisely reflects the original arrangement.

"<u>Design</u>\nA stool of carved and gilt wood upholstered with a valance and cushion, covered in red  velvet and remnants of earlier figured velvets, and trimmed with knotted and tufted braids. The carved beech frame has pierced, tapered legs carved with foliage and lambrequins, joined by scrolling X-form stretchers which meet at a central vase finial. The valance is fitted to an upholstered lip on all four sides, within which the box-shaped cushion sits. The gilding of the frame has been stripped to reveal the original water-gilded surface. The figured velvets and the trimmings are original to the stool, but the worn red silk velvet is later. The trimmings on the cushion differ from those on the companion stool (W.15-2009), and neither precisely reflects the original arrangement. The underside of the cushion is covered in red silk over a red worsted.\n\nThe legs and stretchers are carved with foliage and flower-heads in relief against a cross-hatched ground – the main motifs carved in the wood, the cross-hatching and other surface detail carved in the gesso for the gilding. The quarter-round top of each leg is carved with a husk-filled lambrequin on the front and back faces and with acanthus drops on the sides and corners. Beneath the lambreqins the top part of the shaft is pierced, front to back, the piercing echoing the concave tapered form of the shaft, above a carved drop with a central flower-head. The side faces of the shaft are carved with a volute and laurel drop, parallel to the piercing, and are plain (cross-hatched) below. The bottom of the shaft is carved on all four sides with erect acanthus in high relief, above a shallow blocking – which intersects the stretcher – and the gadrooned quarter-round foot, which ends in a tapered plinth. \nEach quarter of the stretchers is of broken S-shaped plan, flat in the outer half and rising in a scroll at the centre where it ends in a volute. The top of each volute is carved with acanthus, and each upright face is carved with a flower-and-bud motif in the middle. The four quarters meet at a central crossing, which is surmounted by a small gadrooned urn finial.\n\n\n<u>Construction</u> \nAs far as can be seen the frame is made wholly of beech. From losses of wood and joints just visible in the gilding, it is clear that the legs were pieced out from a core of approximately the same thickness as the blocking at the end of each stretcher. The cross-stretchers, two full-length diagonal members, may be pieced out on the top, though this cannot be seen. They are half-lapped to each other at the crossing and secured by the turned finial which is dowelled through this joint (the dowel protruding underneath). The seat rails are tenoned to the legs. The legs and the feet, formed separately, are all tenoned to the stretchers. It appears that the feet each have a larger tenon than the legs (this was assessed by seeing how far a thin film of melinex could be eased into the horizontal gaps between the leg and stretcher and the foot and stretcher, before it was obstructed by the tenon). So possibly each foot was first tenoned into the stretcher, and the leg then tenoned down into the foot tenon. \n\nOne of the short seat rails has a waney edge (with a natural chamfer where it was cut at the curve of the trunk, next to the bark). This rail is more worm-eaten than the rest of the frame, the waney edge being sapwood, which is particularly prone to worm damage.",weaving_technique

All four legs are on brass castors, with laminated leather rollers. The square-edged upholstery, in a three-coloured wool velvet on a plain linen ground, is ‘quilted’ on the back and seat panels, ‘welted’ with blue silk-wrapped cord at every seamed angle, and close-nailed – with brass-domed nails – on the back or bottom edges of the back, seat and arms. The outside-back is covered in a blue-green wool twill. \n\nThe rather massive, square form of the chair is subtly lightened by several features: the scrolled ends of the upholstered arm-rests; the tapered, curved form of the arm-supports, rounded on their top face; the slightly rounded top face of the stretchers, the chamfer on the inside corner of each leg, and the bevelled front corners of the raked back legs in a further kick-back below the stretchers (the back corners are bevelled in the full height of the legs). The upholstery is also worked so as to lighten the chair’s mass, chiefly in the ‘quilting’ of the back and seat, which breaks up these large square surfaces with carefully spaced stitched indents. (The modern term for ‘quilting’ – as it was called in the 18th century – is ‘tufting’, because usually the indents are filled with small tufts of silk or other textile, but in this chair the indents are empty.) \n\n<u>Construction</u> \nThe frame is made of mahogany for the visible elements (legs, stretchers and arm-supports) and beech for the rest (beech is visible in the seat rails and braces, the arm-rests, and the uprights of the back frame; a small exposed area of the top rail also appears consistent with beech). The back and right seat rails have wanes (natural chamfers on the curve of the trunk) on their lower inside edge, and on the back rail the bark remains attached. \n\nThe chair is joined mainly by mortise-and-tenon construction, without use of pegs (as far as can be seen). The stretchers and seat rails are tenoned to the legs, and the seat joints are reinforced with open braces across all four corners, keyed into notches in the rails. In the back-frame a bottom rail (which can be felt at the bottom of the back upholstery) must be tenoned to the uprights, which in turn are tenoned to the full-width top rail (this can be partly felt and partly seen through a hole in the outside-back cover). The back legs extend above the seat, tapering to a point about 12 cm above the upholstery (18 cm above the seat rails), to support the raked back from behind. They are screwed to the uprights of the back-frame, which are each keyed into a notch at the top of the side seat rail, to counteract the pressure exerted by a person leaning against the back. The profile of the back is made to appear of consistent thickness, even where the tapered leg lies behind the upright, by tapering the upholstery of the back reciprocally, down to a point at the bottom (where there is virtually no stuffing between the upright and the velvet cover). \n\nIn the arms, the swept supports are mitred to the front legs (the mitre running down and backwards from the front top corner of the leg); the legs may be tenoned to the supports, or the two elements may be joined by a loose tenon. The arm supports are tenoned to the arm rests, which seem to be tenoned (or perhaps joined by a bridle joint) to the uprights of the back-frame. \n\nThe rails and stretchers are very slightly bevelled on all their exposed edges; this makes the chair slightly easier to handle than a sharp-edged frame would be. \n\nThe mahogany has been darkened by an application of stained wax(?) polish, except on the underside of the stretchers where the natural, paler colour is still visible. On this pale surface, however, there are dark blotches and dribbles, indicating that the polish has been renewed. \n\nThe brass castors, with laminated leather rollers, are fixed by circular plates screwed to the underside of the legs, each with three dome-headed screws. \n\nAt the front end of each side rail, just behind the front leg, a hand-made screw has been driven in from the outside and the tip comes through the inside face. These screws have no apparent explanation in the construction or upholstery of the chair. \n\n<u>Upholstery</u> \nThe armchair is covered in a figured wool velvet, showing large red and yellow flowers, and blue stems and foliage with yellow accents, against an undyed linen background woven with no pile. The velvet is 53 cm wide excluding its selvages. It is placed with the warp running from front to back or vertically, according to its position (but never laterally), and has been seamed with added pieces at the sides of the seat (on the main panel, the front border and the side borders) and of the back (on the main panel and top border), to make up the width. On the main back panel the added pieces are made to mirror (rather than extend) the adjacent motifs, and on the front border of the seat the two added motifs mirror each other; but on the main seat panel no attempt has been made to match the motifs in the added pieces. Moreover the added pieces in the seat are themselves pieced out with small additions at the back, presumably because they were cut from a panel of just the length needed to obtain all the required elements with minimum wastage. On the side borders of the seat the warp runs vertically (like the front border), and is seamed about 12 cm from the back edge. On the side borders of the back the warp runs from front to back (like the top border). On the arm covers the warp runs from front to back in the top panel and vertically in the borders; the borders have a vertical seam on the outer face, near the back of the end scroll, and on the outside the border is lapped over the border of the chair-back (where the warp runs the opposite way). \n\nAll of the angled seams between two pieces of velvet, made to create the cover’s three-dimensional form (as opposed to the flat seams extending the fabric width), are articulated with welting (or piping) of a blue silk-covered cord. The welting was executed in the same process as seaming the velvet, not added afterwards: that is, the blue silk was folded over the cord and stitched in with the velvet in a single seam (two thicknesses of velvet and two of blue silk). This complex technique means that the three-dimensional covers must have been sewn together first – the back and seat cover as a single entity, like a loose cover (but without the outside-back piece) – and then fitted to the upholstered frame. The welting also runs around the arm-rests and arm-supports, where the back and seat panels are each seamed to a velvet fly, which is tucked in beside the stuffing. (This welting is treated differently on the two arm-supports: on the left arm the welting on top of the seat extends around the outside and front of the arm, and the arm is separately welted only around the inside and the back; on the right arm the separate welting is carried around three sides (all but the front), and the seat welting stops at the back of the arm.) In the crease between the back and the seat, a blue-green wool fly has been seamed to the velvet back panel, and another to the seat panel, the latter incorporating a line of welting (although this is never visible in use). The seat fly appears to be stitched to the back fly, and the back fly then nailed to the bottom rail of the back (on its bottom or back face), so pulling the back and seat covers tight into the crease. \n\nThe seat upholstery has a foundation of striped, plain-weave webbing (a pale brown warp with four dark stripes and a central off-white stripe, 4.5 cm wide) and an irregularly striped, broken-twill base cloth, both in linen and/or hemp. The stuffing of curled, undyed (black and white) horsehair is apparently contained by a single stuffing-cover, but this is not visible. The squared form of the seat is constructed by stitching into the upright borders of the stuffing-cover, as in a mattress, apparently in two rows (which can be felt through the velvet), to pack the horsehair out at the sides. This is an early form of stitched edge, superseded at the end of the eighteenth century by the method of stitching diagonally right through the pad, between the borders and the main panel, which produced a much firmer edge. Visible on the underside are three schemes of twine stitching: first, a line of widely spaced stitches around the front and sides (2 to 6.5 cm from the edge, and running diagonally inside the braces); these are probably stuffing-ties stitched up through the stuffing-cover to hold the stuffing in place; this would have been done before the mattress-stitching in the vertical borders. Secondly, in the middle of the seat, is a trail of much longer stitches, which correlate with the positions of the quilted indents on the top of the seat. These were evidently stitched through the stuffing-cover before the top cover was fitted. Thirdly, a trail in blue twine follows almost exactly the same course in the quilting as the second trail. This stitching was taken through the velvet top cover, after the cover had been nailed to the frame. It is pulled very tight, so reducing the tension on the first line of quilting stitches (or possibly those have loosened in part because of the nature of the twine). Despite the tension of the blue stitching, there are no tufts in the quilted indents of this chair to protect the top cover, which has in fact survived without tearing at these points. At the inner face of each arm-support, loose flaps of linen (in the stuffing-cover) and velvet (in the top cover), seamed to their respective top panels, are stitched together and then pushed down between the arm-support and the stuffing. The close nailing was probably the final stage in the upholstery, or it could have been done before the blue quilting stitches. \n\nThe upholstery of the back replicates that of the seat in most respects, except that the foundation may consist of a base cloth alone, with no webbing, and above the arms there appears to be only one row of mattress-stitching; there may be two rows underneath the arms. The blue-green wool outside-back panel was nailed to the frame over the velvet cover, these plain hand-cut nails then concealed by the close-set domed brass nails. At the bottom this cover is folded away on the back face of the legs, and nailed to the underside of the back seat rail. \n\nThe arm pads appear to be formed with two rows of mattress-stitching. The underside of the arms is covered with a hemp or linen canvas, fixed (presumably nailed to the sides) before the velvet top cover (and perhaps before the stuffing-cover). The velvet is oversewn to the canvas with double-twine, so it may be fixed to the frame solely by the decorative brass nails (with no plain tacks). \n\n<u>Condition</u> \nThere is some wear to the velvet pile, and to the linen ground, especially at the front of the seat and on the right arm-end, where the floating pile threads are exposed. \n\nMuch of the silk on the welting has worn away, exposing the buff-coloured cord, though more of the silk survives where it has been protected between the cord and the velvet. On the top front edge of the seat the cord itself is almost entirely missing.",weaving_technique

"voided (figured) ciselé velvet, 1650-1700, Italian; two fragments of a chasuble",weaving_technique
"Two fragments of green voided (figured) ciselé velvet. Their shape implies that they were originally used for the side sections on the front of a chasuble (T.136 was on the left, and T.136A on the right side section). \nThe charming pattern of the velvet is relatively simple; it comprises of small, leafy twigs - each bearing a spray with six berries - leaning in opposite directions in alternate rows. It is achieved by a single, green pile warp against a green taffeta ground. Ciselé velvet comprises two different forms of pile; cut an uncut. These are obtained by using two different rods during the weaving - one for the uncut and another for the cut pile, the latter being higher than the former. This gives the velvet three different levels (ground, uncut pile and cut pile) yielding different three-dimensional effects. In this case, the ground is green taffeta. The outlines and details of the pattern are worked in the uncut pile; their surface has the appearance of parallel rows of delicate, regular, light brown loops. The rest of the pattern is woven in cut pile. Even though the cut and uncut parts are worked by the same, green silk pile warp, the final nuances are different in cut and uncut parts. Where the pile has been cut, the colour is more profound. This is, generally speaking, an important characteristic of ciselé velvets, where achieving the diversity in the motifs relies not only on the different textures of the pile warp, but also on the varieties in the shades obtained.",weaving_technique

"A man's jacket of red silk velvet with a small round opening for the neck; it is open down the centre front; there are no fastenings. It is lined with red cotton throughout except for inside the lower sleeve which is lined with green silk velvet.  This would have been visible when worn because a triangular section has been cut from the back of the lower sleeve, revealing this lining. \nThe seams have been decorated with gold-coloured metal braid - the metal thread being silver strip wound around a yellow silk core.  Similar metal braid has been applied along the edges and around the main decorative panel on the back of each sleeve. Three strips of it extend for 3 cm below the front hem, towards either side.  The main decoration is formed by couched gold-coloured metal thread (see above).  This forms S-shapes on either side of the seams and more elaborate swirling patterns on the centre front panels, across the shoulders on the upper back panel and on the back of both sleeves. In addition there is a band of woven white and green silk and gold-coloured metal thread around the neck and a broaded band of yellow, red, green and blue silk enhanced for part of its length with metal thread along the triangular opening of the sleeves. \nA broad silk braid has been applied to the inside edges of the jacket: it is striped with half of it being red and white and the other half a combination of green, yellow, red, white and brown.

"Armchair of turned beechwood, decorated with polychrome painting of flowers on a gilded gesso ground with background of red and gold arabesques. The back and seat are upholstered in crimson velvet.",weaving_technique
"Armchair of beechwood, decorated with gilding and painting over a gesso ground, with polychrome single flowers over a ground of gilded arabesques on red. The front legs and arm supports are turned as columns, except for the sections where the seat rails and stretchers are jointed to them; the back legs, back uprights and the foot-level stretchers on all four sides are of rectangular section, the back with a marked rake above the seat rail. The rectangular back and seat are upholstered in red velvet, the velvet of the seat a replacement. Originally the chair would have had turned finials at the top of the back uprights, gilded and decorated to match the rest of the frame. \n\nThe frame is painted on all visible surfaces with polychrome decoration of naturalistic English flowers (possibly anemones or roses) on a gilt-gesso ground. In several places (notably on the outer sides of the lower back uprights) the flowers are set against a background of dense gilded arabesques on a red ground, and it seems likely that this ground was originally present everywhere on the chair. The decoration is very much degraded, with much loss of surface, so reading the original scheme is not easy. The arabesque background to these areas was painted with gold powder in a varnish, over a ground that was painted with a transparent red glaze over the base gilding. The naturalistically painted flowers, which include anenomes and roses, are painted in translucent and solid colours (pinky red and a malachite-like green predominate), with black-line details. \n\nThe rectangular seat and back, and the down-curving arms are upholstered in red silk velvet, which survives from the original scheme, although much degraded. On the back the original 21"" (54 cm) width of the velvet is visible in the vertical seams to either side. On both back and arms, the seams (sometimes re-sewn) show fragments of metal-thread trimming. The velvet on the arms has been mounted down onto new velvet. On the back, a shadow line running horizontally just above the arms, would originally have been covered by a deep fringe.Similar fringe, perhaps of different widths would also have hung from the bottom of the back, from the ege of the seat (which would have had a loose cushion, with similar trimming) and possibly from the top edge of the back. A fragment of this survives on the lining of the back, behind the PL upright and shows it to be silver thread. \n\nThe back is lined with plain linen canvas (possibly original), showing a crease between two lines of stitching running horizontally across the middle, with two lines of stitching.  This may relate to the line of fringing that was originally mounted on the front face at this height. Red fabrics (silk and silk velvet) are visible under this on the PL side. The lower back rail is probably a later addition rather than a replacement but the top rail is replaced.  The seat is now reinforced wtih two attached battens, inside the front and back rails of the seat. These support two softwood boards running front to back, with gaps between them.  Neither the battens nor boards show on the photograph published in 1924 (see reference to Margaret Jourdain's book) but may well have been already in place. The edges of a coarse linen base cloth are visible in that photo and it may be the base cloth that currently sits above the softwood boards, supported on two lateral, plain-weave lengths of webbing. This idea is further supported by a black and white photograph taken from the back of the chair, presumably at the same time as the photo published by Margaret Jourdain and now in the collection of Fortt negatives held by the Furniture, Textiles and Fashion Department at the V&amp;A. It appears to show the current canvas. Derek Balfour (conservation upholsterer) and Frances Collard (V&amp;A curator noted in the 1990s that the double-thread weave of the canvas was similar to canvas on other chairs of the period which are known to retain their original upholstery. The nails that attach the battens could be earlier than 1924, although the crimson velvet (possibly cotton) dates from after that time. \n\n\nThe chair is of standard mortise-and-tenon construction.  The arms show a down-curving profile and are notched on the underside about half way along, in a manner that is generally seen in oak armchairs of the 17th century. Because the upholstery has been repaired, it is difficult to understand how this appeared when the chair was new.",weaving_technique

This removable cover is kept in place by a series of eyelet holes which hook over metal pegs fitted to the seat rails. Some of the chairs in the set of which this one is a part retain fragmentary evidence of their original silk 'scarves' - silk flaps that hung from the top edge of the back, normally out of sight behind the chairs, but which could be folded over to protect the front of the chair-back when in use. While these protective 'scarves' are mentioned in archival sources, these chairs are the only instance so far identified of surviving evidence of them. \n\nThe structural upholstery is of linen webbing, linen (ticking) base cloth, horsehair stuffing, and linen stuffing-covers. The webbing and base cloth is visible only in the seat. \n\nThe legs and seat facings are of oil-gilded walnut. In carved areas, the oil gilding has been applied as a layer of ochre-coloured oil or paint brushed directly onto the wood, with gold leaf laid on top. The sanded areas of the frame are gilded over a 'sanded' ground. Coarse sand was laid onto the wooden surface of the chair frame as the first stage of gilding; layers of ochre-coloured paint or oil, followed by gold leaf, were then applied on top of the sand. The use of a sanded ground is unusual on gilded chairs but became common in the 1720s on gilded picture and mirror frames, primarily those made in a William Kent style. On this set of chairs, the contrast between the smooth gilded surface of the carved sections and the duller matt finish of the sanded ground works to throw up the elaborate ornament of the carving. \n\nThe use of oil rather than water gilding is unusual in a set of furniture as grand as this one. It is likely that oil gilding was used to relate the chairs to the architectural gilding used elsewhere in the room, which used the same technique.\n\nThere have been some later changes to the surface of the chair. Small areas of both carved and sanded wood have been over-painted with bronze paint. In some areas, there is a second layer of sanding which is lifting off the chair. This second layer is found mainly over joints on the chair, and suggests areas where repairs have been made to cover opened cracks in the joints.",weaving_technique

The width of the fabric (height on this chair) is 54.5 cm (21½ inches). Originally the scarf would have hung loose from the top, but this fabric has been stitched to the sides as well as to the top. Furthermore, this piece of silk appears not to be the original scarf for this chair: Remains of an original scarf -- in the same fabric -- can be seen along the top edge, as on most other chairs in this set. This piece of silk is also longer than would have been needed for this chair; if not stitched down it would overlap the ends, but it has been folded away underneath. So this piece is probably the original scarf to one of the armchairs, or cut down from one of the settees, and may have been transferred to this chair in some antiquarian phase of restoration.",weaving_technique

The sleeves are lined with linen; the bodice with white silk taffeta, open at the back.  The sack  has two, double box pleats at the back, extending from shoulder to hem.  At the front, the skirts are pleated into the waistseam.  The sack is made of 3 widths of silk at the back and sides.

The hem is faced with a deep band of white silk taffeta.\n\nThe petticoat is made of four widths of silk pleated at the waist. \n\nThe sack and petticoat were altered in the late 19th century for fancy dress.  The binding of the petticoat waist was removed and adjusted to lengthen the petticoat.  The seams of the sack  side gores were restitched to alter the shape of the skirts.  The waistseam at the fronts was unpicked and resewn.  A strip of whalebone was added either side of the lining opening at the back of the bodice.  Hooks and thread bars were added to the bodice fronts.  The sleeve ruffles were removed to shorten the sleeves, then re-sewn and pink silk ribbon bows added to cover them.

"Box constructed of oak and walnut, decorated with painted and gilded leather. The box has a sloping top and a double lid, the outer enclosing a shallow tray contained in the inner lid, which opens to disclose three divisions, two with lids. The fall-down front encloses three drawers, the centre one divided into partitions and those on the side fitted with sliding lids. There is a small drawer with compartments fitted at the right side. The interior is covered with leather painted and gilt. The inside of the outer lid is decorated with interlaced strapwork, enclosing the badges of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. The inner lid bears the arms of Henry VIII encircled by the Garter, and with putti blowing trumpets as supporters. On either side are figures of Mars in armour, and Venus with Cupid, each under Renaissance canopies. The lids in the interior are painted with a medallion head of Christ and Saint George and the Dragon below a canopy. The front, above the three small drawers, is decorated with a male and a female profile head  and scrollwork designs; the falling flap bears profile heads of Paris and Helen, inscribed 'Paris de Troy' and 'Helen de Greci' on a ground of arabesques.\nThe rim below the outer lid is covered in parchment and bears the inscription in classical lettering (much rubbed): 'DEUS REGNORUM EC[CLESIAE] CHRISTIAN[A]E MAXIMUS PROTECTOR IMPERII DA SERVO TUO HENRICO OCT[AVO] REGI ANGLIAE DE HOSTE TRIUMPHUM M[AGNUM].\nThe exterior of the desk is covered with shagreen and fitted with metal-gilt angle-mounts, loop handles and ball feet, all added during the 18th century.\nThe interior surfaces of the compartments are lined with red silk velvet, probably added during the 19th century.

The basic design of the decoration was applied to this in gold leaf outlined and detailed with black pigment. Large background areas were then coloured blue, figures painted in flesh tints with brown hair and highlights applied to the gold leaf with red and green glazes. The pigments used are azurite (blue), vermillion (red), calcium carbonate [chalk] (white), carbon black, iron oxide(?)

"red velvet with pomegranate pattern, embroidered orphreys with crucifixion, 1375-1500, Italian or Spanish velvet; German/Bohemian embroidery",weaving_technique
"This chasuble is made of two different velvets (front and back), both probably dating from the fifteenth century, two different plain-weave linen linings (front and back), and column orphrey on the front, a Y-shaped cruciform (<i>Gabelkreuz</i>) orphrey on the back. The orphreys seem to match each other in style and technique, though they have been cut down from longer pieces at some point before being applied to these velvets. A pink linen is used to line the back and an undyed linen the front. There is some evidence of a red dye staining the back. (During conservation, blue linen was found stitched into the seams at the neck, possibly evidence of a previous lining, and some very hard linen crin.) Some wax adheres to the front (that on the back was removed during conservation).\n\nThe red cut velvet of the front has a less complex design than that on the back. The symmetrical pattern is built up around a simple pomegranate motif on the front, and a more complex composition comprising both pomegranate and flowers on the back. Both velvets belong to the type described as ferronerie because of the finely delineated motifs which look like ironwork. On the back it is clear that prior to the application of this particular orphrey, a simple Latin cross had been stitched to the velvet. The front of the chasuble is heavily pieced, so that no single repeat of the very long motif is present (no less than eleven pieces of velvet have been cobbled together to create the front).\n\nThe orphreys are made of linen, embroidered with silver, silver-gilt and polychromatic silks (shades of blue, green, red, yellow). They are very worn in areas, thus making visible the linen ground and the inked outline drawn for the embroiderer to follow. Some areas of the design have been built up into raised work, providing a three-dimensional effect. Couched work and split stitch are the main forms of stitching, though there is also evidence of knotting (possibly not original).\n \nThe front column orphrey is embroidered with two full-length figures under Gothic canopies: the Virgin and child at the top, a saint with a crown below, holding a chalice and wafer (the Host). The figures are mainly embroidered in colours, though their attributes, the edge of their garments and their haloes are in metal thread. The background is of metal thread couched down. \n\nThe Y-shaped orphrey on the back has a ground of metal thread couched down. The dominant feature is the figure of Christ crucified on the cross (this figure is at least ten inches longer than any other on the band). At the foot of the cross stand the Virgin (hands in a gesture of prayer) and St John (a book in his hand). These figures have been cut down to fit the chasuble. The figure of Christ is long and emaciated, the original shading of the embroidery clearly showed the rib cage, and the contrast of the blood spouting from the wounds inflicted by the gruesomely large metal nails which pierce his feet and hands, and raised work emphasising his facial features and his halo. The halo is not only lavish in embroidery but also has three triplets (glass; see below) incorporated to highlight the cross embedded in the design (one triplet is now missing).* These must have caught the light. To the left and right of the cross, within the arms of the orphrey are small-scale, bust-length figures of angels, two on each side, all with haloes and wings. On the right, the figure with its head covered with its mantle, points to the cross (probably an older woman to go by the attire), while below the figure with long golden tresses, a diadem and peacock feather wings holds out a three-dimensional chalice to catch the blood of Christ. The chalice is formed in such a way that the blood can actually drip into it. On the left are two completely bare-headed angels, the lower one holding a chalice in the same way as his counterpart on the right hand side. Above the cross is a scroll containing the inscription INRI (the initials almost entirely worn away). A bird (eagle), wings spread, rests its claws on the scroll while behind him two peacock-winged angels swing hanging censers made of raised gold thread work The cross is very realistically depicted, some attempt at perspective being introduced through the use of plain versus 'grained' planes of the wood.\n\n\n* Triplets are gems made from three different components which can be a broad spectrum of materials. In the case of the chasuble, the intention appears to have been to simulate cabochon rubies. The triplets here are made from two pieces of colourless transparent glass, each in cabochon form, the bases in contact, between the two is a transparent red cement. The joint is covered by the fabric 'setting'.  As the red colour is reflected around the colourless glass the overall appearance is that of a gem with a red body colour.  The cement has oxidised over time and so contracted and crizzled towards the edges and the colour is now largely lost.

"This whole entry is being amended. No longer applicable. (8/7/14)\n<u>Design</u> \nA large, carved and painted-but formerly gilded-armchair, with stuffed back, seat and arm pads. The frame is boldly carved all over with C-scrolls, rocailles, cabochons, flowers, foliage and other rococo ornament. The serpentine-sided, round-cornered back is raised on struts above the serpentine-fronted, slightly canted seat, which has scrolling aprons merging in profile with cabriole legs that end in scroll feet. The back and seat are linked by carved open arms, each arm support rising from a large C-scroll in the side rail and mirroring the form of the front legs. The frame is painted yellow with details picked out in green and the flowers in red, this scheme introduced in 1968. The chair is covered in yellow plain-weave silk, trimmed on the back and seat with a wide woven cotton(?) braid, dating from 1968-70.\n\nThe chair-back is carved on the front face with rocailles, acanthus scrolls and flowers, centring on a cartouche of decorated C- and S-scrolls at the top, and one of smaller scrolls with cabochons at the bottom, the supporting struts formed as bead-spined acanthus sprays. Similar rocailles are carved on the seat-frame, the front rail centring on an apron cartouche of further decorated C-scrolls, echoing the top rail. Each of the side rails is carved in the front two-thirds with two nearly abutting C-scrolls-the front scroll merging in outline with the front leg, the larger one behind merging with the arm-support. Above the scroll the arm support is carved with a flame-like motif and at front and back of each arm rest are pairs of leafy C-scrolls. Each of the front legs is carved at the knee with a rocaille-framed, heart-shaped cabochon; each of the back legs, with a C-scroll-framed shell; and all four legs have a ruffled moulding descending to the foot, which ends in a foliate scroll raised on a shallow plinth. The back seat rail, like the back third of each side rail, has moulded edges but almost no carving, except for a vivacious central rocaille scroll with acanthus-scroll lower border. The back-frame above this is entirely plain.\n\n<u>Construction</u> \nThe chair appears to be made of beech throughout, and the front seat rail is pieced out in the apron. The four seat rails are tenoned and double-pegged to the front legs and the full-height back uprights. The four seat rails and both rails of the chair back are tenoned and double-pegged to the front legs and the full-height back uprights (except that the bottom rail of the chair-back appears not to be pegged). The arm-supports are tenoned and double-pegged to the seat rails, and perhaps pegged singly to the arm-rests. Each arm-rest is housed in the front face of the back upright at almost full section (slightly rebated at top and bottom but not at the sides), and tenoned in and pegged, singly, behind the housing. At the joints of the top rail, the through-pegs can be seen to be tapered, being larger in diameter at the front than the back; probably the same technique is used throughout. The front leg joints are now reinforced with blocks glued and nailed in the inside angles with the seat rails.\n\nThe present paint is applied over a single scheme of matt and burnished gilding, which has been revealed on the back right leg where some of the paint has been removed. This is executed in water gilding, or possibly a combination of oil and water gilding for the matt and burnished areas respectively.(1)\n\n<u>Upholstery</u> \nThe upholstery is entirely modern, at least in the seat. This has a foundation of jute close-webbing (with three narrow stripes), which appears to date from the early twentieth century and, on top, a jute base cloth that, together with all the materials above it, probably dates from 1968 when the chair was re-covered (see below). The seat is stuffed primarily with vegetable fibre, secured with loosely woven jute and apparently constructed with a stitched edge on all four sides (with just one row of top stitching); on top of this is a thin layer of vegetable fibre and horsehair, secured with fine linen, and then a layer of cotton wadding beneath the yellow silk top cover.(2) The back of the chair is covered on the back face, immediately behind the foundation, in the same yellow silk as is the front and must, therefore, have been reupholstered at the same time. It appears to be skate stuffed, but all the internal materials are concealed.\n\nThere are numerous tack holes on the back uprights and arm-supports, at and just above the level of the seat, from which the original form of the upholstery can be tentatively reconstructed. The holes on the front face of the arm supports suggest that originally the dome of the seat was slightly higher at the front than now. On the back uprights there are holes on the completely plain flat face behind the seat, indicating that the seat cover was taken around these uprights. Only by doing this, or by fixing blocks to the front and inner squared faces of the legs, could the upholsterer have avoided exposing flat spandrel-shaped areas of wood, as now, at the top of these faces-an unresolved treatment that cannot have been adopted originally.\n\nOn the underside of the seat rails are clusters of tack-holes suggesting that at one time the seat has been sprung. There are also remnants of a thin linen bottoming cloth, fixed nearer to the outer edge than the cloth used to support the springs (and too light to take the strain of springing).\n\n<u>Notes</u> \n1. A cross-section of a burnished area taken in 2009 yielded thick gesso, red bole, water gilding, gesso or a gesso-like layer, and yellow paint. A cross-section of a matt area (on the side of the foot) yielded gesso, several layers of gilding intermixed possibly with an oil mordant (no bole), yellow paint, and varnish. Overtly this suggests that the matt areas are oil-gilt, but the intermixed areas could alternatively be a rather careless treatment of water gilding.\n\n2. These layers can be seen where the top cover and linen stuffing-cover have been unpicked at the left end of the back seat rail. There is a conspicuous row of large stitches in the underside of the webbing, behind the front seat rail; how (or whether) this relates to the present upholstery construction is unclear.",weaving_technique

The lid contains eighteen panels, worked in high relief in coloured glass, containing scenes from Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses</i>, each identified below with a brief title. These scenes are framed with strips of white enamel bearing floral scrollwork. The inner face of the drop-front is divided into five panels, each of which was probably originally set with enamelled plates that have a blue ground and floral motifs (the colours of which have decomposed). Three of these enamelled plates remain; the second and fourth are missing and have been replaced by crudely cut-out engravings of birds and butterflies pasted to the red ground of the wooden backing. Another enamelled panel, similar but containing a head of a woman among the scrollwork, is set above the keyboard. Surrounding all these panels and covering the entire keyboard is a decoration consisting of coloured glass rods, rosettes and sequins, and of small spirals of brass wire. The soundboard is covered with glass rod decoration and contains a rose of <i>c.</i>112mm diameter.\n\nHoward Schott, <i>Catalogue of Musical Instruments in the Victoria and Albert Museum.
