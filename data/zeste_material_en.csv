The embroidery of the early 17th century has given way to the lavish use of ribbons in the 1660s and 1670s.<br><br><b>Materials & Making</b><br>The ribbons have been arranged and attached in deep loops and bows covering the gauntlet of the glove.  A wide ribbon of white silk, silver-gilt and silver has a gauze weave creating an open effect.  At the selvedges (the edges of the weave, which were finished in such a manner as to prevent fraying) silk threads create a picot edge (an edge formed of small loops of twisted threads). The narrow ribbons are of ivory and salmon-pink silk with silver strips.  Here, the selvedges have been cut to create a decorative frayed edge.<br><br><b>Trading</b><br>Ribbon was originally woven on a narrow hand-loom, but  only one piece could be made at a time. New technology in the 17th century allowed one worker to operate up to 24 looms at once.  The increased availability of ribbons influenced fashion, particularly men's wear. Breeches, doublets (close-fitting body garments) and gloves were liberally festooned with great bunches of decorative ribbons.<br><br><b>Disapproval</b><br>Moralists condemned the extravagant use of ribbons in dress, especially by men. In 1661 the diarist John Evelyn commented on one young 'fashion victim' as having 'as much Ribbon on him as would have plundered six shops, and set up Twenty Country Pedlars; all his body was dres't like a May-pole'.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

Princes' Kaftans from Ottoman Turkey

These three kaftans (and another in a nearby case) were worn by Ottoman princes who died when they were children. They were preserved in imperial tombs where, in accordance with Ottoman custom, they were placed over the graves of the deceased.

The kaftans may have come from the graves of the 19 younger sons of Sultan Murat III, who were executed at the succession of their half-brother, Mehmet III, in 1595. This gory practice, designed to avoid a struggle for the succession, was never repeated.

The kaftans, woven of silk and metal-wrapped thread, show that even in childhood, Ottoman princes were dressed in the same lavish style as the sultan and his courtiers. The wide range of designs of the time include a meandering vine set with tulips, which clearly influenced contemporary embroidery (see case opposite).

This chasuble is the vestment (priestly garment) worn by a Catholic priest when celebrating the Mass. It was - and is - worn over the alb and stole. 

Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time.  The combination of secular and ecclesiastical textiles is not unusual in vestments, the silk being suitable for both secular and ecclesiastical use, the iconography of the embroidered orphreys being specifically ecclesiastical. This chasuble has been made of Italian (or Spanish) velvet, cut down from its original bell shape into the fiddle shape that became popular in the early seventeenth century. The use of two different velvets and the evidence of stitchmarks from previous incarnations do not allow exact identification of the time of making of the garment - but do indicate how highly valued such textiles were even after they had been used. The colour suggests this chasuble would have been worn on the feast days of martyrs. 

The velvet on the back is identical to velvets in the Lehman collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and a chasuble in the Schnutgen Museum. It is an elaboration of the basic pomegranate motif, with floral and foliage excretions growing out from the central motif contained within the framing compartments (Thurman, no. 104, p. 179; Museum Schnutgen, no. 27, pp. 142-3). 

<i>Orphreys</i>.
The shape of the orphreys (column on the front, y-shaped cross on the back) was typical of the Netherlands till the mid sixteenth century and the Rhineland, according to Johnstone. She asserted that the orphrey was probably from Bohemia (the current Czech Republic, a geographical area encompassing Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia).  'Orphreys of this period frequently shared features of the Rhineland orphreys, the short-armed Gabelkreuz, the realistic wood of the cross, curving rays in the haloes, and so on. The crucifixion scene also shows strong likenesses with the wall paintings at Karlstejn [20 km south of Prague].'(Johnstone, col. pl. XVIII F and p. 42). The same combination of materials, imagery and form is found in the chasuble catalogued as Rhineland, late 15th century in the Schnutgen Museum (Museum Schnutgen, no. 63, pp. 240-1). 

A number of objects in the Schnutgen Museum in Cologne conform to this format and style. They are dated to the end of the fifteenth century.(Museum Schnutgen, nos. 9, pp.80-1, 27, pp. 142-3, 30, pp. 151-3.) 

<i>Symbolism</i>. 
The birds and feathers within the imagery are probably as symbolic as the direct Christian messages from the crucifixion scene. Such associations came from Bestiaries which originated in England in the 11th century, containing tales around real and fantastic animals, often with a moral content. 

It seems likely that the bird above the cross is an eagle rather than a cock (as suggested in the original entry in the Accessions Register) because the eagle is specifically associated with St John the Evangelist and the Gospels in general, is the highest flier, and may represent Christ or the human spirit aspiring to God. The cock, in contrast, is sometimes a symbol of vigilance, but is usually associated with St Peter's denial of Christ. This bird lacks the crest of a cock and has a decidedly rapacious appearance, very similar to the outstretched form found on lecterns in churches.

The peacock feathers used for the wings of three of the angels are a common device. Peacocks were symbols of immortality, as the ancients believed that the flesh of the peacock was incorruptible. They appear frequently in Early Christian mosaics. 

The significance of Christ's blood in late-medieval Christianity and in depictions of the Crucifixion in different media has been explored recently in the context of Germany and would illuminate the graphic references in the (now faded) blood spurting from Christ's wounds and its collection into chalices by angels. (Caroline Walker Bynum. <i>Wonderful Blood. Theology and practice in late medieval Northern Germany and beyond</i>. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007).

The colour of the triplets may also be significant. In 'The Curious Law of Precious Stones' George Frederick Kuntz quotes from 'Speculum lapidum', Leonardi, 1502, that rubies 'removed evil thoughts, controlled amorous desires, dissipated pestilential vapours, and reconciled disputes'.  So quite apt for a liturgical vestment.

The orphreys seem to match each other in style and technique, though they have been cut down from longer pieces at some point before being applied to these velvets. A pink linen is used to line the back and an undyed linen the front. There is some evidence of a red dye staining the back. (During conservation, blue linen was found stitched into the seams at the neck, possibly evidence of a previous lining, and some very hard linen crin.) Some wax adheres to the front (that on the back was removed during conservation).

The red cut velvet of the front has a less complex design than that on the back. The symmetrical pattern is built up around a simple pomegranate motif on the front, and a more complex composition comprising both pomegranate and flowers on the back. Both velvets belong to the type described as ferronerie because of the finely delineated motifs which look like ironwork. On the back it is clear that prior to the application of this particular orphrey, a simple Latin cross had been stitched to the velvet. The front of the chasuble is heavily pieced, so that no single repeat of the very long motif is present (no less than eleven pieces of velvet have been cobbled together to create the front).

The orphreys are made of linen, embroidered with silver, silver-gilt and polychromatic silks (shades of blue, green, red, yellow). They are very worn in areas, thus making visible the linen ground and the inked outline drawn for the embroiderer to follow. Some areas of the design have been built up into raised work, providing a three-dimensional effect. Couched work and split stitch are the main forms of stitching, though there is also evidence of knotting (possibly not original).
 
The front column orphrey is embroidered with two full-length figures under Gothic canopies: the Virgin and child at the top, a saint with a crown below, holding a chalice and wafer (the Host). The figures are mainly embroidered in colours, though their attributes, the edge of their garments and their haloes are in metal thread. The background is of metal thread couched down. 

The Y-shaped orphrey on the back has a ground of metal thread couched down. The dominant feature is the figure of Christ crucified on the cross (this figure is at least ten inches longer than any other on the band). At the foot of the cross stand the Virgin (hands in a gesture of prayer) and St John (a book in his hand). These figures have been cut down to fit the chasuble. The figure of Christ is long and emaciated, the original shading of the embroidery clearly showed the rib cage, and the contrast of the blood spouting from the wounds inflicted by the gruesomely large metal nails which pierce his feet and hands, and raised work emphasising his facial features and his halo. The halo is not only lavish in embroidery but also has three triplets (glass; see below) incorporated to highlight the cross embedded in the design (one triplet is now missing).* These must have caught the light. To the left and right of the cross, within the arms of the orphrey are small-scale, bust-length figures of angels, two on each side, all with haloes and wings. On the right, the figure with its head covered with its mantle, points to the cross (probably an older woman to go by the attire), while below the figure with long golden tresses, a diadem and peacock feather wings holds out a three-dimensional chalice to catch the blood of Christ. The chalice is formed in such a way that the blood can actually drip into it. On the left are two completely bare-headed angels, the lower one holding a chalice in the same way as his counterpart on the right hand side. Above the cross is a scroll containing the inscription INRI (the initials almost entirely worn away). A bird (eagle), wings spread, rests its claws on the scroll while behind him two peacock-winged angels swing hanging censers made of raised gold thread work The cross is very realistically depicted, some attempt at perspective being introduced through the use of plain versus 'grained' planes of the wood.


* Triplets are gems made from three different components which can be a broad spectrum of materials. In the case of the chasuble, the intention appears to have been to simulate cabochon rubies. The triplets here are made from two pieces of colourless transparent glass, each in cabochon form, the bases in contact, between the two is a transparent red cement. The joint is covered by the fabric 'setting'.  As the red colour is reflected around the colourless glass the overall appearance is that of a gem with a red body colour.  The cement has oxidised over time and so contracted and crizzled towards the edges and the colour is now largely lost.

An image of the Crucifixion can be seen with the Virgin and St John at the foot of the Cross and angels holding chalices in which to catch the blood of Christ. The chasuble is made up of the favoured luxury materials of the time, having an embroidered orphrey (the decorative piece attached to the chasuble), which dates from the later part of the 15th century, applied to a sumptuous velvet ground dating to about 1430-1470. The orphrey was probably originally attached to another chasuble and was cut off and re-used here. It is likely that the orphrey, with its very distinctive style of bold images and figures with large heads, was worked in Bohemia. Embroidery was highly regarded in the medieval period in Europe and at its finest matched goldwork and painting. 

The velvet was made in Italy or Spain, then the centres for velvet weaving in Europe, and provided an ideal foil for rich embroidery. The style of  'pomegranate' shaped motifs on the voided velvet (a technique whereby the design is produced by leaving areas free of velvet) came to typify Renaissance textile design.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as ‘piecing over paper’. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. The papers are usually removed once the project is complete. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples, such as this cover of squares and triangles. The work is often embellished with appliqué and embroidery to enhance the design. A bedcover that has been pieced but not wadded is often referred to as a coverlet.

This patchwork of fashionable silks was probably made to form part of a larger bed cover or screen, and was hand-pieced over paper. The tacking stitches and paper template are still intact, suggesting that the cover was never finished. Papers still visible in the reverse provide a record of reading habits at the time, including a newspaper from 1705 which records the trial of the notorious plotter, Titus Oates. 

For the embroidery, the maker has taken inspiration from many sources. Several of the silk patches have been stitched with motifs taken from popular prints and books, including Aesop's Fables.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/efa2b102-c985-3e11-b451-39992c03deb3","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","In eighteenth-century Britain, the bedrooms of the wealthy were used for the display of luxury goods. They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Ornamental patchwork bed hangings and quilted bed covers reflected a household's access to a range of fashionable textiles, from colourful imported chintzes to sumptuous silk velvets. Many were bought specially, but householders also recycled textiles from other objects, a common practice given the financial and emotional investment in valuable fabrics.

This patchwork of silks and velvets would have been made as a bedcover or screen. The original design incorporates small embroidered panels, and a wide variety of plain and
patterned silks. A less technically accomplished hand has added figurative embroidery and appliqué to many of the patches after the completion of the piecing. The additional embroidery shows a wide range of popular needlework subjects, including four chinoiserie figures and a scene from Aesop’s fable ‘The Fox and the Vase’. 

No information concerning the provenance of the coverlet was available when it was acquired, but when the later lining was removed for conservation, it revealed an early eighteenth century paper template. Newspaper cuttings relating to the trial of Titus Oates and an advertisement for a proprietary medicine date the template to around 1705. Plain paper has also been used in several areas. Because paper was an expensive consumer item, it was common practice in even the wealthiest households to recycle it. Alongside the range of silks, this suggests an affluent household with access to a range of luxury consumer goods. In 1709 the Female Tatler described the exciting experience of shopping for such goods: ‘The shops are perfect gilded theatres . . . As people glance within their doors, they salute them with – Garden silks, ladies Italian silks, brocades, tissues, cloth of silver or cloth of gold, very fine mantua silks, any right Geneva velvet, English velvet, velvet embossed.’","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

They were embroidered in about 1425, probably to be applied to an altar hanging, but were subsequently cut off and reapplied to red silk velvet, which is of a later date. This was a common practise. Expensive ecclesiastical embroidery was often reused, or a vestment or hanging might be cut up to suit changing church fashion. The scale of the figures indicates that the scene came from a sizeable hanging rather than from a vestment and would have been quite visible from a long distance away in a church. Stylistically the scene is late Gothic: the figures are fairly insubstantial with elaborately draped costumes and softly waving hair. It is a fine example of  later 'opus anglicanum' (Latin for 'English work'), which reached its peak between about 1250 and 1350.

The embroidery is worked with silk, silver and silver-gilt thread in split stitch and couched work.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

They were worn for day and evening wear. Wealthy women owned many pairs suited to different occasions and carefully chosen to match particular outfits. Strict rules applied to the wearing of gloves. A woman would be considered undressed if she left the house ungloved and it was customary, for instance, to keep gloves on in church, at the theatre and at balls but to remove them before dining.

These embroidered white kid gloves are typical of day gloves worn by women in the 1830s and 40s. The fashion for pale coloured soft kid leather was the subject of much discussion in etiquette manuals. It was considered extremely bad form to wear discoloured or worn gloves, leading some to claim they 'can only be worn once'. This particular pair appear to be unworn as there is no sign of the stretching required to wear such close fitting items. The glove pattern is cut with 'quirks' (a piece which fitted at the base of the thumb) and 'fourchettes' (the side panels for the fingers), and they would have been fastened by a single button at the wrist, which is missing on the right hand. There is no pointing on the backs of the hands as these were left plain in order to accommodate the floral design. This extremely fine hand embroidery is near identical on both left and right and forms a concentrated design over the back of the hand, typical of the period. The design is stitched in coloured silk with silver thread used for the foliage.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

Their stylized floral patterns and less expensive materials imitate the elaborate embroidered versions carried by the aristocracy.  Many bear mottos or expressions relating to charity, friendship or luck, which suggests that they may have been used for gifts of money.  This example is inscribed 'heare et is hit or miss'.

The development of the 'drawn-glass' technique about 1490 allowed the manufacture of large numbers of small, round, coloured beads with a central hole, of the type used in this purse. The glassworks on the island of Murano near Venice were the most famous during the Renaissance, but by the early 17th century the technology had spread to glass-making centres in Amsterdam and Bavaria.  Beads were produced mainly for trade with North America and Africa, but they were also sold in Europe for use in embroidery.

The expression 'hit or miss' is first recorded in the English language in William Shakespeare's play <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> published in 1606, where it has the same meaning of random luck that it has today.  The expression may have derived from a country dance also known as 'hit and miss', recorded as early as 1626.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

This large silk hanging represents the 'Womb Treasury World', the mystical universal source, or 'womb', from which all things emerged. The iconography is based on the text of the Mahavairocana Sutra: At the centre of the mandala is the Buddha Vairocana, who is preaching the Dharma (the Truth upheld by the Universe) to four Buddhas and four Bodhisatvas. 

The four Buddhas might be Ratnashvaya (<i>Baosheng</i>  in Chinese, East), Amida (<i>Mituo</i> in Chinese, West), Akshobya (<i>Ajiu</i>South), and Amoghasiddhi (<i>Chengjiu</i>North) (it should be noted that these positions may vary in different mandalas). Together with Vairocana, they are known as the Five Meditation or Wisdom Buddhas.

The Boddhisatvas are possibly Samantabhadra (or Vajradhara, <i>Puxian,</i> in Chinese; South-east position), Manjusri (or <i>Wenshu</i> in Chinese; South-west), Avalokitesvara (<i>Guanyin</i> in Chinese; North-west) and Maitreya (Mi-le in Chinese, North east). 

The Manchu rulers of the Qing Dynasty originated from the northeast of China, and the empire extended to neighbouring Monglia and went as far as Tibet. Patronage of Buddhism in these areas was an important aspect of imperial diplomacy, and diplomatic gifts often exchanged. This mandala (embroidered on 'royal yellow'-coloured silk) was possibly presented by Mongol princes to the Yongzheng emperor for a temple under imperial patronage, and possibly one at the important pilgimage site of Wutaishan in Shanxi province.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/627"

Its style is quite different from other 17th-century purses. The flat, circular base with sides gathered on a drawstring prevented spilling or revealing the contents, and the coat of arms on the bottom identified the owner. 

This gaming purse is made of velvet dyed a bright orange-red, a colour known in the 18th century as ‘tawny’.  It is embroidered with fleur-de-lys in silver thread on the sides.  The coat of arms of Cardinal Duke de Matignon are embroidered in silk and silver gilt on the bottom.

Playing and betting on card games was a socially acceptable pastime for the wealthy in the later 17th century.  Along with dancing, riding and the theatre, it was an amusement for those classes that did not have to work. The coat of arms identify the owner of the purse as Jacques de Goyon de Matignon who was consecrated Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church in Paris in 1673. The evidence that he regularly played and gambled on cards is appropriate to his aristocratic birth.

1660-1680

Gaming or gambling with cards was a popular 17th-century pastime.  A gentleman or lady who did not participate in games such as 'Quadrille' and 'Basset' would have been considered 'low-bred and hardly fit for conversation' according to  'The Compleat Gamester', published in 1674. Typically, a gaming purse had a flat, circular base with sides gathered on a drawstring.

Women of the Qajar court in early 19th-century Tehran would have worn this combination of short jacket, gauzy open-fronted blouse and voluminous skirt. They would have henna-painted hands and feet, and sometimes even painted bodies. A painting on the wall opposite this case show Qajar women wearing similar clothing.

Watts Gift

The flock of cranes decorating this <i>fukusa</i> convey wishes for long life and happiness. Cranes were believed to live for a thousand years and to inhabit Mount Horai, the land of the immortals. They are one of the most common motifs in Japanese art. This <i>fukusa</i> would have been appropriate for celebrations of birthdays and weddings.

The design is executed almost totally with gold wrapped thread which is couched down with stitches that are virtually invisible to the naked eye. The wings of the birds are also padded. The embroidery looks particularly striking against the indigo blue background, which became a popular choice for <i>fukusa</i> from about 1850.

This <i>fukusa</i> was presented to an Englishman, William Rogers, at the Emperor's Palace in Japan in 1874. His sister gave it to the Museum in 1923. [December 1993]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/627"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/00a4fa34-3d00-39b1-a772-19e1d8bd4f18","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","A flock of flying cranes is embroidered in a raised and couched technique using gold-wrapped thread on an indigo-dyed, dark bleu satin. This <i>fukusa</i>has no lining. The cranes in the lower half are turning right and those on the upper half are turning left. This <i>fukusa</i>was donated by Mrs. Walts, whose brother, William Roger, was presented with it in 1874 at the ""Mikado's Palace"" in Japan.

In Japan since the early Heian period, 794-1184, cranes have been regarded as birds of longevity. This belief had it origin in China. In the Chinese Taoist book <i>Huainanzi</i> (<i>Enangi</i> in Japanese) written in the 2nd century BC, there is mention of ""a thousand year old crane."" The Chinese admired the crane for it beauty and regarded it as the companion of a legendary wizard. It later came to imply longevity. In Japan the crane is also loved for its elegant posture and its clear cry. In the <i>Manyoshu</i>, a collection of poems from 7th to 8th century, this cry is expressed as the ""one cry of a crane,"" meaning the final voice of authority. The idea that the crane combines aspects of  purity and naivete in its elegant features is derived from Taoist thought. There is a Japanese proverb, ""the crane lives thousand years, and the turtle lives ten thousand years."" The crane actually lives for about 80 years and therefore was considered to have a long life, especially when people had an average life span of 50 years. Since the crane continues to live in one place from generation to generation, it further promotes the idea of living for a long time. Hence, the crane and the turtle have become a highly revered symbol of longevity along with the <i>sho chiku bai</i>, pine, bamboo and plum. These patterns are commonly found not only on <i>fukusa</i> but also on art work and craft objects. The crane, as well as the turtle, is also associated with the sunrise, Mt. Fuji, <i>sho chiku bai</i>, auspicious clouds, the ocean, waves, the character of <i>kotobuki</i> etc., in order to express a sense of purity and longevity on a happy occasion. The crane is also a symbol of conjugal harmony as implied by its dance at  breeding time and two cranes together express conjugal bliss. At this time, according to legend, one has an open beak while the other has a closed beak, as an expression of a'un. (See p. 270)

Often the crane is shown in flight with a strip of paper attached to its leg. This motif is based on the legend of Minamoto Yoshitomo (1123-60?), and his son, Yoritomo who put gold plates on crane's legs when they flew from Yuigahama beach. The cranes flew back to Tazawa in Shizuoka prefecture hundreds of years later. In another story the lord of the Ii family in Hikone captured the cranes. This motif or design symbolises the long life of the crane.

This <i>fukusa</i> with a flock of flying cranes is a good omen, many <i>kotobuki</i>, or a hundred <i>kotobuki</i>, which is appropriate for any celebration.

Their wealthy owners engaged in few commercial exchanges requiring cash although embroidered bags were sometimes used as 'gift wrapping' for a gift of coin.  Some served as 'sweet bags', filled with dried flowers or scented powder, to perfume clothing and deter moth.  The attachment of a pincushion to this purse suggests that it might have been used as a sewing kit.  An X-ray of the pincushion reveals a needle, lost in its depths.  

Both are made of an even, plain-weave linen, which has been completely covered with silk floss, silver-gilt and silver file threads.  These are stitched over every intersection of the warp and weft, in tent stitch and single-stage stitch, covering the ground.  This form of decoration, was also used on furnishings such as curtains, bed hangings, table carpets, chairs and cushion covers.

The decoration of this purse and pincushion is identical to a knife case with two knives, T.55-1954, acquired at the same time, and all three may have been made as a set.  Seventeenth-century inventories often list purses, knives and pincushions together, indicating that these were essential accessories for both men and women.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

The coat has a round neckline, bound with a narrow strip of silk.  The shaped, two-piece sleeves end above the wrist, with a round cuff ((12.8 cm at top, 13.4 at bottom).  The coat fronts curve slightly from neck to hem, with skirts below the hip, set in pleats (18 cm deep), one in the front, one back, at the side seams.  There is an inverted pleat on each side of the centre back opening.  There is a pocket flap on each coat front at hip level.  The sleeves are lined with white fustian, the pockets with bleached linen and the rest of the coat with white silk taffeta.  The coat fronts are interlined with coarse linen and the front skirts with wool.  The coat is embroidered in a design of two interlaced serpentine lines made of interlaced silver thread, silver spangles and purl, with flowers of silver foil.  The embroidery covers the coat fronts, the cuffs, pocket flaps, pocket surrounds, edges of the back vent.  There are 12 passementerie buttons of silver foil, thread and purl on the right front, from neck to pocket flap, but no corresponding buttonholes on the left front.  There are 3 buttons below the pocket flaps, 3 on the cuffs, one above the pleats, one holding the pleats at the hem (pleats now undone), and 2 on the back edge of the skirts at the side seam.  

The waistcoat fronts and back are made of the same blue watered silk.  The neckline is round and bound with a narrow strip of silk.  The waistcoat fronts curve from neck to hem, with skirts below the hip, ending at mid-thigh.  There is a pocket flap on each waistcoat front at hip level.  The pockets are lined with bleached linen, waistcoat torso with white fustian, the skirts and pocket flaps with white silk taffeta.  The front edges are faced with the taffeta.  The waistcoat is embroidered in the same design and materials as the coat, along the front edges and hems, around the pockets and on the pocket flaps.  There are 12 small, silver passementerie buttons on the right front, with 12 buttonholes bound with silver-wrapped parchment, couched with silver thread.

In 1970 Jean-Paul Asselberghers, curator at the Musées royaux d'art et d'histoire in Brussels, presented the most recent interpretation of this and kindred panels. He suggested that this panel is one of four made for the Order of Vallombrosa. The others are in the Musée royaux d'Art et d'Histoire in Brussels and the Musée Cluny in Paris. All four panels match each other in size (to within two or three centimetres), in the disposition of nail holes round their edges, and in their embroidery technique and colours (although Asselberghers only actually studied firsthand the pieces in London and Brussels). Originally, in the late 19th century, the subjectmatter had been identified as two pairs: two panels of St Verdiana and two of St Dominic. He re-identified the saints, suggesting that each scene related to an incident in the life of a different saint revered by the Vallombrosans.

<b>Subjectmatter</b> 
Asselberghers identifies the scenes as: the death of Saint Verdiana (London); the funeral of St Umilita (Humility) Negosanti, foundress and abbess of  the convent of Saint John the Evangelist in Florence (now in Brussels); the blessed Pierre Igné successfully surviving trial by fire in 1067 in the presence of Saint John Gualberto (who had founded in 1055 a community in Vallombrosa which followed an adaptation of the Rule of St Benedict) (now in Paris); and St Arialde siezed by the order of the Archbishop of Milan (Paris). All four saints were venerated by the Vallombrosans. Indeed, St Arailde was canonised in 1075, the year following his death. On her death in 1310 St Umilita's corpse was laid out for several days so that the people could pay their respects, such was her popularity - hence the iconography of this panel which can be compared to a painted panel of the death of this saint which was part of a retable consecrated to scenes of the life of the saint, painted by Pietro Lorenzetti for the church of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Salvi in Florence in 1341 and now in the Musée des Offices (For further information, on St Umilita. St Verdiana were the only female saints venerated by the Vallombrosans. 

<b>St Verdiana</b> 
Born in Castelfiorentino in Tuscany in 1182, Verdiana or Viridiana Attavanti died in 1242 and was canonised in 1553, her feast day being February 1st. She made the pilgrimage to Santiago to Compostela before being walled up as a hermit in her native town in a cell adjoining the chapel of St Anthony, with two snakes as company. She lived in her cell for 34 years under the obedience of the Vallumbrosan abbey. The Franciscans claim her as a tertiary (i.e. a lay member of their order). Many miracles are ascribed to her; she is called upon in the litany of the Sick to intercede against snake bites. (D. Attwater. 1983. <i>The Penguin Dictionary of Saints</i>, 2nd ed. revised and updated by C.R. John, New York; www.catholicculture.org/lit/prayers Litany by Benjamin Francis Musser OFM  (Trinity Communications, 2006) [accessed January 2006]). 

<b>Function</b> 
Asselberhgers considers that stylistically the embroideries date to the first half of the 15th century (Examination of the dress depicted would suggest the same). He also suggests that the panels were probably most appropriate for use in an antependium on which three horizontal rows of two or three panels flanked a large central panel. He cites the antependium in the collegiate church of Manresa, Catalonia as an example of this type, embroidered in the 14th century.  He does not believe they are the right size for dalmatic panels.  

<b>Embroidery in 15th-century Italy</b> 
Embroidery was both a professional craft and a woman's accomplishment by the early 15th century, the quality and content of the needlework revealing the skill of the author. The identity of the author of the image is usually unknown although some well-known painters, such as Botticelli, made designs for embroidery. Like painting, embroideries could be narrative as well as decorative, the subjectmatter religious or secular. In this particular instance, the content of the embroidery suggests a devotional and didactic function. A focus for prayer, such images could act as behavioural models for their owners, and were usually kept in the more personal and private rooms in the houses of a wealthy family. (Paola Tinagli. <i>Women in Italian Renaissance Art. Gender, Representation and Identity</i>. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1997, Chapter 5 'The Cult of Female Saints: Images of Devotion and <i>Exempla</i>) It is therefore possible that this embroidery belonged to a woman who considered St Verdiana an appropriate role model because of her saintly behaviour if it was not a section of a larger embroidered piece for an altar frontal or an apparel for a dalmatic.  The existence of three other comparable panels suggests that that the altar frontal hypothesis may be most appropriate, though at a later date it could have been used as an inidivual image.

<b>St Verdiana in literature, art and film and Tuscany</b> 
Saint Verdiana is mentioned in Bocaccio, <i>DeCameron</i>, Day 5, Story 10.
She appears in Giovanni del Ponte’s Ascension of St John the Evangelist with saints, circa 1410-20 (National Gallery, London) in the habit of a Franciscan tertiary (?) holding a snake in each hand. The painting is inscribed, identifying the saints and she is at the bottom of the left pilaster. A good comparison with this imagery is that in Fra Angelico's Perugia tryptich from the predella of  the death of St Nicholas, on the left hand side of the bier (See Martin Davies, <i>Early Italian Schools</i>, 1986, p. 248). 

On his return to Spain from exile in 1960, Luis Buñuel made a Palme d’Or winning film, entitled Viridiana and based loosely on a nun who experiences a series of mortifications.

A Museum devoted to St Verdiana has recently opened in Castelfiorentino, near the Sanctuary of Santa Verdiana. It contains works of art by Taddeo Gaddi, Jacopo del Casentino, Francesco Granacci, the Maestro delle Effigi Domenicane, Benedetto da Maiano, Bernardo di Stefano Rosselli among others, as well as illumintated codices, wooden statues, terracottas, historic dress, liturgical and precious objects and reliquaries.

<b>Additional information on other panels</b> 
The Catholic Encyclopedia:[accessed May 2009] states:
'St. Umiltà is usually regarded as the foundress of the Vallumbrosan Nuns. She was born at Faenza about 1226, was married, but with the consent of her husband, who became a monk, entered a monastery of canonesses and afterwards became an anchoress in a cell attached to the Vallumbrosan church of Faenza, where she lived for twelve years. At the request of the abbot-general she then founded a monastery outside Faenza and became its abbess. In 1282 she founded a second convent at Florence, where she died in 1310. She left a number of mystical writings. In 1524 the nuns obtained the Abbey of S. Salvi, Florence. There are still Vallumbrosan nunneries at Faenza and S. Gimignano, besides two at Florence. The relics of Bl. Umiltà and her disciple Bl. Margherita are venerated at the convent of Spirito Santo at Varlungo. The habit is similar to that of the Benedictine Nuns.'","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/627"

It is worked in fine multi-coloured silks and gold thread in split stitch on a linen or linen and cotton ground. The gold threads are worn but originally the background would have been shiny and bright. The high quality of the stitching indicates that the maker was a skilled craftsperson, either trained in a guild or in a convent. It is likely that the image was made for a space that was devoted to meditation or prayer. The maker and user may have been the same person. The similarity to religious paintings of this period in terms of colour and imagery should be noted. 

The subject matter suggests that the embroidery was made in Tuscany; this saint is not well known outside Italy. St Verdiana (or Viridiana) led a holy life and may have served as a model for girls in whom modesty and religiosity were encouraged. She made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (Spain) before living the rest of her life as a hermit. Many miracles are ascribed to her, and in particular her name is invoked as protection against snake bites. Note the snakes that writhe in front of her. The official cult of this saint is recorded from 1553 when she was canonised. She does however appear in religious images before that date.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/627"

The gold thread is very worn which masks the fact that it would originally have formed a very large proportion of the background, different stitches showing different features.

The picture depicts a scene from the Legend of St Verdiana (Viridiana) Attavanti, recluse and patron saint of Castlefiorentino in Tuscany, northern Italy. To the sound of bells miraculously rung, a group of people enter the saint's cell to find her kneeling dead, while her soul is borne aloft by angels; the snakes whose company she adopted for mortification lie entwined before her. The scene is set in a chamber in which the saint is kneeling at her prayers before a picture; on the walls is a floral pattern. On the left hand side, behind her a group of seven men watch her from beside a belfry, in which two bells swing. Five of the men are tonsured (a sign that they were members of the secular clergy) and the one at the front of the group wears a dalmatic which was originally silver (in or nué technique). Their gestures are of amazement and reverence: the man at the front has his hands raised, palm forward. One figure, whose head alone is visible, holds his hand to his head. Two wear capuccio or chaperons, hoods typical of early 15th-century Tuscany, and long gowns (one with matching sleeves, the other a lucco with slits through which the sleeves of a contrasting undergarment are visible). Their length is indicative of their high status, as short version of the lucco could also be worn. In the centre of the room, above the latticed window, two angels are raising the saint heavenwards. On the left, arms outstretched, a nimbus round her head, St Verdiana kneels before an altar, in front of which writhe two snakes.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/627"

MARTHA EDLIN'S EMBROIDERY<br>
The small scale of each piece is further evidence of Martha's sewing skills. She used different stitches and techniques, like the flame stitching on the small pincushion and plaiting on the cords of the purse. [27/03/2003]","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

She would have embroidered it herself. It does not appear to have been used. It is worked in flame stitch, a technique also sometimes known as Irish stitch, Hungarian stitch, florentine stitch and bargello stitch, the variety of names indicating the uncertainty of its origins.<br><br><b>People</b><br>Martha Edlin (1660-1725) worked a series of embroideries during her childhood, including this jewellery case, which were cherished by her descendants and passed down through the female line in her family for over 300 years. We know little about her life, except that she married a man called Richard Richmond and appears to have been a prosperous widow living in Pinner in Greater London at the time she drew up her will, with daughters and grandchildren.<br><br><b>Materials & Making</b><br>Following the usual development of needlework skills in a young educated girl in the mid-17th century, Martha Edlin embroidered a sampler in coloured silks at the age of eight, and a more complicated piece in whitework and cutwork at nine. By 1671, her eleventh year, she had embroidered the panels of an elaborate casket, and two years later this beadwork jewellery case. The needlework skills she demonstrated in these pieces would be important attributes in her adulthood, in the management of her household and the making, mending and decoration of her own and her family's clothes.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

Indeed, the agent of the Duke of Parma requested just such a silk with a nice green or blue ground from a Lyonnais manufacturer in the 1760s, appropriate for wearing to the theatre in Naples. Such silks probably cost between 36 and 180 livres per ell, at a time when a court dress required about 15 ells, and an unskilled labourer earned about 200 livres per year.

Women's gowns worn over wide hoops provided a large canvas which showed off the pattern, and which sparkled as its wearer moved in candlelight. Vestments in the Catholic Church and for the statues of saints and of the Virgin Mary might also use this kind of silk.

The breeches comprise 2 legs and 2 waistbands of the green silk satin; the back legs are cut higher than the fronts and gathered into the back waistbands.  There is a pocket on each front, under the fall front and a watch pocket in each front waistband.  The breeches close with buttoned front waistbands and a fall front.  The breeches are lined with fustian.   Four embroidered buttons fasten the waistband and 2, the fall front.  Two fustian-covered buttons fasten the front pockets.  There are 5 worked buttonholes and 5 embroidered buttons on the outside of each leg above the knee.  The knee bands are embroidered with silver thread, spangles and purls in the same design as the coat and waistcoat.

The suit was altered in the late 19th century, probably for theatre costume.  The coat lining was patched and repaired; the centre-back seam of the waistcoat unpicked and linen tape ties added.  An additional waistband was added to the breeches to lengthen them.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

The design epitomises the luxuriant fashionable designs of its date of production. These designs are in the idiom we now call Rococo, a light-hearted style associated with the move away from formality that began after the death of Louis XIV (d. 1715) in France and found its early expression in the furnishings and dress used in city mansions (<i>hôtels</i>) in early 18th-century Paris. The design shows some of the most important characteristics of the style: it is asymmetrical, meanders sinuously across the fabric, and makes bold use of natural history, in particular shells and flowers. 

The style of design is often asscoiated with an innovative designer called Jean Revel (Paris, 1684-Lyon, 1751) who is credited with introducing motifs that were more naturalistic than those in previous silk design. His ideas were probably the result of contact with the tapestry workshops at the Manufacture Royale des Gobelins in Paris. Luxuriant foliage was a hallmark of many tapestry borders and Revel's innovation in Lyonnais silks was to find a way of achieving a similar effect in a different form of weaving.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

The pattern is woven in shades of pink, red, maroon, blue, white, and green silks and metal - in total 13 colours in silk brocading wefts and one silver brocading weft. The colours are remarkably unfaded (as the still vibrant colours on the back of the silk reveal). The silver is only slightly tarnished. The pattern consists of large conch shells sprouting flowers and foliage cornucopia-like and linked by silver ribbons which meander away from the spiralling contours of each shell to join the one above. The shell motif is repeated twice across the width of the silk, and alternate rows incline in the opposite direction, thus forming with their ribbons graceful continuous S-shapes down the length of the fabric. The flowers are naturalistic in form and shading due the use of the technique of <i>points rentrés</i> (the dovetailing of colours). The flowers are fantastical in form, but look as if they were inspired by hop flowers and either pink and blue forget-me-nots or stocks. The selvedge consists of stripes of yellow, green, pink, red, green and yellow silk woven in <i>gros de tours </i>and edged with six cords each formed by two thick silk threads. The brocading silks are bound in 3/1 twill. 

A small rectangle of fabric has been inserted at the top left hand side of the length, measuring about 212.5 x 102.5mm. It probably relates to the original use of the silk as part of a sack, and would have corresponded to the armhole. The creases and folds at the top of the fabric, and the length of the piece, are consistent with the pleated back of such a gown. A series of holes down each selvedge at fairly regular intervals reveals that the silk has been nailed taut to a backing at some later date and when removed the selvedge has been torn. The silk has cracked horizontally about 660mm from the bottom, and there are some areas around the metal thread motifs where the silk has cracked from the weight of the brocading.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

This chasuble is the vestment worn by a Catholic priest when celebrating the Mass. It was - and is - worn over the alb and stole. This style of chasuble became widespread after 1600. Prior to that - at the time from which this embroidery dates - chasubles were circular garments which slipped on over the head.

Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. This fact usually accounts for the dominant imagery being on the back and the construction being more perfect there. This chasuble is probably made from Italian (or Spanish) velvet, cut down from its original bell shape into the fiddle-shape that became popular in the early seventeenth century. The colour suggests this chasuble would have been worn for requiem masses or for Easter. 

The velvet was probably made in Italy or Spain, then the major velvet weaving centres in Europe, and provided an ideal foil for rich embroidery which might be executed at home or abroad.

It is a brocaded silk which makes use of polychrome silk and real silver thread to create the pattern on a dark green ground. The technique of brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into the pattern of a fabric in specific, sometimes very small areas. It was laborious work for the weaver.

This is probably a French silk because its width conforms to the regulations laid down for the silk weavers of Tours in the late 17th century and subsequently adopted by the guild of silk weavers (Grande Fabrique) in Lyon. Such regulations attempted to control the composition and quality of all products.  

The style of motif corresponds to the early 1730s when designers were gradually developing more naturalistic motifs which were often combined with fantastical elements. The Lyonnais designer Courtois was credited with attempting to create three-dimensional effects in the 1720s, and in the following decade Jean Revel (1684—1751) found a method of dovetailing colours which took these attempts further.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

He requested 300 ells (approximately 400 yards) of fabric for Queen Marie Antoinette's apartments at the palace of Saint Cloud. The silk was originally intended for upholstery and wall hangings, and was called a 'blue and silver damask lampas' in the contemporary documents. The order was delivered in April 1792, just a few months before Marie Antoinette was guillotined. The entire quantity of the fabric was used by the Revolutionary government in 1796 to pay off a national debt to Greek merchants who may have considered melting down the silver to change it into currency.

The pattern was composed of three subjects: children, vases and cupids; animals at rest; and the departure of Diana (goddess of hunting). The border was to be made up of caryatides with a brownish ground. Camille Pernon, the most prominent of silk manufacturers in Lyon, manufactured the fabric which was to cost about 50 livres per ell. By the time of the order's delivery, inflation had raised the cost to over 76 livres per ell. The total was extremely extravagant; at that time a master weaver in Lyon might earn about 1,800 livres per year and the lowliest employee in the silk industry earned only 200 livres per year.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

(Johnstone, pp. 16-17). Mitres were established headgear for bishops by the eleventh century, and were also worn by the Pope (Bishop of Rome) and high-ranking abbots. By the 12th century they were usually made in white linen or silk, and often had figurative scenes showing saints. They gradually became decorative rather than figurative, so that by the Renaissance their patterns were often quite secular in appearance. In this case the embroidered images are positively secular, the only reference to Christian iconography being the hands holding palm branches in the centre of the decoration. The palm branch was the symbol of the triumph of faith over the suffering of martyrdom.

The style of embroidery fits within Renaissance developments, with references to grotesque ornament which spread in the early sixteenth century from Italy (Johnstone, p. 79). The term grotesque refers to the location of the designs, the grottos, which inspired the style, rather than to the subjects themselves. The most important of these, discovered in 1493, were parts of the celebrated Domus Aurea, the Golden House of Nero (ruled AD 54–68), in Rome. Designs of masks, draperies, vases and other motifs were found painted on walls and ceilings.

It is likely that such skilled needlework was executed in a professional workshop or in a convent. Embroidery workshops existed in large towns by the Renaissance, governed by guild rules over the training of apprentices, the preparation of embroidery materials and the execution of the needlework. In convents, nuns often exercised their needles in the service of the church by making vestments, as well as teaching girls the requisite skills of a well-brought up woman: embroidery, reading and writing (e.g. Giovanni di Pagolo Morelli in <i>Ricordi</i> (begun in 1393), cited in Mary Rogers & Paola Tinagli. <i>Women in Italy, 1350-1650. Ideals and Realities</i>. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2005, p. 107.

Reputedly, at one time, this mitre was in the possession of Bishop Palmieri who had been born on  August 10, 1493 in Naples, where he subsequently became a cleric. He was elected archbishop of Acerenza and Matera, after his uncle Vincenzo Palmieri resigned in his favour on July 30, 1518. A special dispensation was required as he had not yet reached the canonical age of 27. He became a cardinal in the consistory of November 21, 1527, receiving his cardinal's red hat and the charge of S. Clemente in November 1527. He resigned the government of his see in favour of his brother nine months later.  He was administrator of the see of Sarno between May 1529 until August 1530, administrator of the see of Lucera between August 1534 and February 1535, and he participated in the conclave of 1534. In June 1535 he became administrator of the see of Conza, for a year, and subsequently administrator of the see of Policastro from July 1535 until his death in January 1537. Named by Holy Roman Emperor Charles V governor of Milan right before his death, he died on January 20, 1537 in Rome and was buried in the church of S. Maria del Popolo, Rome.

The outer layer of the back and front of the mitre and the outer edge of the lappets are ornamented with embroidery in an apparently secular pattern of closely arranged acanthus scrolls, supported by winged, naked cherubs; birds rest on the leaves. The pattern is symmetrical about a vertical axis, with the central motif being a pair of disembodied hands holding palm branches (usually the symbol of martyrs) and surmounted by a coronet whose spiked points end in fleurs de lys.  The rest of the composition is built out from this central motif and is light-hearted in feel, a simple form of the grotesque style.

The earliest surviving guild regulations are available for Lisbon and date to 1517. Lisbon, the largest city in Portugal and its capital, only had a small number of skilled masters in the sixteenth century: in 1551 about 10, in 1552 about 16 working in eight workshops, and in 1620 about 11. The guild regulations reveal the different levels of examination that led to mastery of the trade, embroiderers having to learn how to prepare different materials and motifs. The simplest task was the making of 'a coat of arms in gold and silks with some kind of motif appropriate to arms', and the most difficult the embroidering of the human figure, in particular, the features of the face, and the use of different qualities of gold thread.  The embroidered motifs on this piece fall between these two extremes of complexity. (Teresa Alarcao & José Alberto Seabra Carvalho, <i>Imagens em Paramentos Bordados. Seculos XIV a XVI</i>. Instituto Português de Museus, 1993, p. 19-20).

No contract for this type of Portuguese embroidery has been found, so the costs of producing such work and the negotiation between client and craftsman are not known.

As a result of Portugal's voyages of discovery from the 15th century onwards, the Portuguese came into contact with designs from different cultures, including China and India. Such taste impacted on Portuguese textiles. The V&A collection has a small but impressive group of Sino-Portuguese and Indo-Portuguese style embroideries (about 120), which date from the 16th to 18th centuries; most are made in multi-coloured silks on cream or white satin grounds, rather than in the rich materials used here. Indeed only three pieces, all from circa 1550-1600 are embroidered velvet. This piece is unusual in combining Chinese and grotesque (Roman) styles, and at the time of its purchase was deemed typical of a particular strain in Portuguese decorative arts.

It should be noted however that Spain also made major voyages of discovery in this period and it is likely that this taste entered the vocabulary of its decorative arts about the same time.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/627"

The repeating motif comprises a symmetrical pattern made up of dragon or lion-like motifs with birds (firebirds?) and stylised foliage and flowers on either side of a 'vase' containing a plant.

By the thirteenth century clerical attire was more or less stabilized throughout the Latin Christian church. According to the <i>Rationale for the Divine Offices</i> of the canonist and liturgist William Durandus (d. 1296), all ranks of the higher clergy were entitled to wear the cope (or <i>pluviale</i>) for processional occasions on feast days. As a result, inventories of monastic churches testify to the existence of a very large number of copes, Canterbury, for example, owning no fewer than sixty copes in 1315. (Dyan Elliot, 'Dressing and Undressing the Clergy',  in E. Jane Burns ed. <i>Medieval Fabrications. Dress, Textiles, Cloth, and Other Cultural Imaginings</i>. London, 2004, pp. 56-58; Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds, 2002, p. 11.)

The cope had developed from the same Roman garment (<i>paenula</i>) as had the chasuble, but by the eleventh century had a different form: it was semi-circular and open down the front; the front opening fastened just below the neck across the chest with a short strip of embroidered material or a morse (a metal clasp); orphrey bands ran the full length of the front opening and on the back, the cope retained a vestigial hood which was triangular or shield-shaped (as in this example). (Johnstone, op.cit.) The cope was so voluminous that its rich materials lent themselves to recycling for other purposes. There are many surviving examples of chasubles and dalmatics made of this kind of silk velvet, but fewer examples of full copes, some of which may have been cut down into other less voluminous vestments. Christa Mayer-Thurman illustrates and describes similar velvet copes or pieces of cope in different liturgical colours (green, purple, blue and red) in <i>European Textiles. The Robert Lehman Collection</i>, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2001, pp. 74-87; Donald King illustrates and describes part of a red velvet cope from Italy or Spain in <i>European Textiles in the Keir Collection 400BC to 1800AD</i>, London, 1990, cat. 49, p. 76.

<i>Iconography</i>. 
The saints depicted in the orphrey bands probably connect the cope to a Cologne church, or at least a church nearby - and their identity is reinforced by the lettering below their image and attributes. Two of them, St Ursula and St Severinus were Cologne saints. Severinus was not very popular elsewhere. St Hubert seems to have been the dedicatee of a military order established by the Archbishops-Elector of Cologne and was frequently represented in the Cologne area. See Conversion and Mass of St Hubert panels in National Gallery (Glyn Davies). The composition of the Death of the Virgin on the hood is likely to relate closely to imagery in paintings of the period. The depiction of the figures suggests that the scene is based on the Apocryphal Gospel, in particular the passage narrating the moment of the Virgin's death, surrounded by eleven of the Apostles (according to that source, St. Thomas was preaching in remote countries and did not return in time). Here there are, however, twelve apostles, John being the youngest and represented as such, beardless. The symbols that are difficult to make out in the embroidery, because of wear, are probably the palm, All Souls Book, censer and candles.

<i>Textile</i>. Silk velvets of this type were woven in centres in Italy and Spain during the fifteenth and sixteenth century. They were often called 'ferronerie' velvets because the effect created is similar to that of ironwork. They ranked among the most expensive luxury textiles of the time.

Dye analysis, carried out at the Institut Royal du Patrimoine Artistique in Brussels in 2007 by Inge Vanden Berghe, identified the red dyestuffs as insect red and tannin (gallnuts), with a trace of red wood. Her conclusion was that the red velvet was dyed with precious red insect dyes: Polish cochineal alone, or a combination of the very expensive kermes with Armenian cochineal. All three dyes sources were in use in Europe in the fifteenth century. According to the study done by Hofenk de Graaf on red dye sources used between 1450  and 1600 (based on TLC analysis), Polish cochineal was often found in Italian silks, whereas often Armenian cochineal or kermes were detected in red fifteenth century silks with a Spanish origin. She also notes that the use of gallnut for silk weighting, in the case of a later dyeing of light colours as scarlet and crimson shades, was most likely in fifteenth century Spain. (Judith H. Hofenk de Graaff. <i>The Colourful past: origins, chemistry and identification of natural dyesfuffs</i>. Abegg-Stiftung and Archetype publications ltd., 2004, esp. pp. 62 and 68).

<i>Embroidery</i> 
The way in which the haloes are worked in a succession of curving rays is evidently characteristic of German embroidery (Johnstone, p. 75), and may be compared with the piece from the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich illustrated in her book as Fig. 86, and with the Bohemian chasuble bought from Bock by this museum in the following year (1375-1864). The application of metal threads in a diaper pattern in the ground is also similar.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/627"

The cope developed from a Roman cloak-like garment and was semi-circular, opening down the front. Orphrey bands ran the full length of the front opening. On the back, the cope retained a vestigial hood which was triangular or shield-shaped. 

Some of the saints depicted on the orphrey bands probably connect this cope to a Cologne church, or at least a church nearby. St Ursula and St Severinus were Cologne saints and St Hubert belonged to a military order established by the Archbishops-Elector of Cologne. Their embroidered names identify them.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/627"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/1ca8b262-7dc7-365e-9a99-a592bf3d784c","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","Semi-circular garment made up of widths of deep red silk velvet seamed together; a contrasting embroidered orphrey band is stitched along the opening, and a non-functional embroidered hood is attached centre-back at the neck. The velvet is of the type usually described as <i>ferronerie</i>, because the pomegranate pattern is delineated by a fine outline thought to imitate ironwork. Four full widths of velvet and two three-quarter widths make up the garment, the two central widths are intact, the other panels reveal how carefully this costly textile was used as the outer edges that form the circle have been pieced together from a number of small pieces. A deep fringe is attached round the semi-circular side - probably a later addition although such fringes were used in the Middle Ages. The whole of the cope is lined with deep blue linen (in excellent condition) - also pieced together.

<i>The orphrey bands</i> are embroidered with images of saints (see below), in coloured silks (blue, green, red and brown) and gold thread (Cologne work); there is evidence that originally sequins were sewn on to the blue background embroidery: a few sequins have survived on images of St Lucy and St Severinus, and the reddish thread that attached them to these and other parts of the embroidery is visible against the blue in all cases. The faces of the saints are stitched in white, but the features seem to have been drawn on below the surface (possibly a similar technique to that used as in Butler Bowdon cope). There is also evidence of restoration work executed in white thread, couched down, especially on the right hand side (when worn). A fine yellow braid/ribbon is sewn over the edges of the ophreys on both sides. It dates to either the late 19th or early 20th century.

<i>The hood</i> is of couched gold thread, with figures representing the Death of the Virgin Mary and is very worn. The draperies were originally of gold threads, whipped round with fine coloured silks; the heads of the various figures are of canvas embroidered with fine silks in long and short stitches. A narrow red and white fringe is sewn around the hood. It is lined with blue linen, a shade lighter than the lining of the rest of the cope.

<i>Iconography</i>.  The figures depicted on the orphreys are saints who each inhabit a similar space, placed below a castellated wall, under a decorative Gothic arch, they stand on a tesselated floor; below the floor, in Latin, is the inscription bearing the appropriate name. When the cope was on the clergyman's body, the saints faced each other across the opening: from bottom to top, St John the Baptist faced St Hubert, St Ursula faced St Lucy, St Severinus faced St Bernadino and Saint Elizabeth faced St Mary Magdalene. The textiles worn by the saints (as long flowing robes) echo the pattern found on the velvet of the cope - large, abstract pomegranate designs. Each saint carries the appropriate indicator of status and attribute: the bishops Severinus and Hubert wear mitres and carry croziers, those of royal lineage, Ursula and Elizabeth (of Hungary) wear crowns, the martyrs, Ursula and Lucy carry palm fronds. Mary Magdalen is depicted with long flowing tresses, holding a vase of ointment; Elizabeth holding a garment (no doubt an allusion to those she made for those in need). 

The hood shows the death of the Virgin. She lies in a rectilinear bed in a room with a window on the left hand side above the bed. Round the bed are twelve male figures with haloes round their heads. Eleven are bald and bearded, the twelfth is clean-shaven and has a full head of hair. He is holding a jar (?). He and two other saints in the group are behind the bed, looking towards the Virgin; one of them holds a palm branch. To their right is another group whose attention is focussed on an object that looks like an incense burner. In front of the bed side two saints looking at a book, and to their right is another saint with a book who looks as if he is reading to the assembled crowd.  Only the faces, hands and hair of the saints is executed in silk (much worn); the rest of the embroidery (draperies, bed, background) is in different metal threads (the Virgin's robes, sheet and pillow, probably in silver-gilt; the saints'/apostles' garments, bed, bedcover, background) in gold. The metal threads are couched down, the background using a red silk, and creating a geometric diaper pattern. The ground is badly worn, so much of the brownish linen base textile is visible. The haloes are worked in a succession of curving rays, which shows up the gold to great advantage. A shield has been applied centre bottom of the hood; it is divided in half, the left blue with two silver cylinders, the right red with a gold band at the top and two gold chevrons over the red. Round the edge of the hood is a half-inch band of brick stitch embroidery in metal thread, and attached round the outer edge of that band is a narrow braid in red and white (half-inch), ending in a fringe.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/627"

The embroidery has been built up from a base of linen, stitched in coloured silk (in three shades of green, of blue and of red), silver, and silver-gilt thread, in couching, and long and short stitch. The ground of the embroidery is executed in different textures and fillings of metallic thread, and some of it is raised work. The pattern on the velvet consists of an interrupted wavy diagonal stem, bearing on one side conventionalised pine-cones, and on the other pomegranates in a circle of leaves. This pattern is seen best on the back of the chasuble as the front has been pieced together. The back is also much less worn than the front, revealing the construction of the embroidery. It is lined in blue linen.

<i>Iconography</i> 
The orphreys depict scenes from the Life of the Virgin, mainly on backgrounds of gold and silver and were originally intended for a cope rather than a chasuble. They have been mutilated when recycled, the lowest compartment of the design cut to suit the length of the chasuble, and two of the remaining compartments used to trim the neckline. They have been unsympathetically used, so that the same scene is at the same level, but cannot be read left to right. Each scene comprises a group of people in an architectural setting, definitely classical in line rather than Gothic.The folds on the clothing of the figures are very carefully delineated.

Round the neck: 
(1) the death of the Virgin, lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles, and 
(2) the Assumption of the Virgin, borne up by angels with St Thomas by the tomb below.

On the back: 
(1) the Anunciation; the Virgin seated, the Angel kneeling, God the Father appearing in the clouds and the Dove descending; 
(2) the presentation of the Virgin in the Temple; she ascends the stair to the High Priest, her parents, St Anna and St Joachim, wait below; 
(3) the meeting of St Anna and St Joachim; they embrace before the Golden Gate of Jerusalem, an angel touches their heads and a manservant and maidservant attend them; 
(4) the rejection of St Joachim's offering: he carries away a lamb from the altar behind which three priests are sitting or standing; 
(5) the angel appearing to St Joachim among the shepherds, the lower part is missing. 

On the front orphrey: 
(1) the Announcement of the approaching death of the Virgin, she is seated, the angel bearing the palm kneels to her, behind her stand a group of the Apostles; 
(2) the betrothal of the Virgin to St Joseph; the priest joins their hands in the presence of St Anna and three suitors; the two figures on the extreme outer edges are very fashionable dressed for the mid 15th century
(3) the birth of the Virgin; St Anna in bed, a woman beside her and a servant bringing a bowl, the lower part cut away.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. The front is more worn than the back because it has rubbed against the altar. The embroidery on the orphrey bands tells the story of the Life of the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus Christ, from the moment the angel announced her forthcoming birth to her mother St Anne, until her journey to heaven after her death.

The silk velvet of the chasuble was probably made in Italy, which boasted the most sophisticated centres of silk manufacturing in Europe in the 15th century. The style of the embroidery on the orphreys is very similar to Florentine paintings of the early to mid-15th century. The shape dates to the 17th century or later. Precious silk and fine embroidery, especially containing metallic threads, were used economically and were often recycled.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

The chasuble is an example of the richly decorated vestments commissioned for use in the Church. This particular example is typical of the International Gothic style favoured in the fifteenth centuries, the silk velvet characterised by scrolling motifs consistent with a dating of the late fifteenth century. Such a silk was suitable for both secular and ecclesiastical use, and might have been made in an Italian or Spanish centre (the most developed in Europe at this time). At that period chasubles were conical in shape, rather than fiddle- or violin-shaped, so this garment must have been altered at a later date (after the beginning of the seventeenth century). The silk may even have begun its life as a different form of dress or furnishing altogether, no major distinction between secular and ecclesiastical designs being made at that time. The orphreys may well date to earlier in the century, their composition and treatment being similar to Italian paintings of the 1420-50 period. The dimensions of the compartments of the orphreys may be useful eventually in identifying the geographical location of making (when guild regulations become easily accessible for different cities). Currently, identification can only be speculative, based on the aesthetics of the images. It is possible that these orphrey bands were originally intended/used for a cope. The embroidery was probably executed either in a professional workshop (urban or church) or by nuns. Certain similarities with the needlework image of St Verdiana (Viridiana) (4216-1857) in terms of composition and architectural setting are very evident; it is thought to be Florentine.

<i>Iconography of orphreys</i> 
The Life of the Virgin is told in the embroidered panels on the orphreys in eight vignettes, including the Annunciation and Assumption. Rogers and Tinagli note that from as early as the 2nd century, Mary's virtues of humility, obedience, modesty and silence were extolled in contrast to Eve's negative characteristics, and that in the early fifteenth century such ideas were communicated to a wider audience visually via Fra Angelico's Annunciation scenes, and verbally by preachers such as the Franciscan Bernardino da Siena (e.g. in a 1427 sermon). Devotional activities focussed on different aspects of her life and were encouraged in Italy by both the church and the state, and many groups - not just women - felt drawn to her cult.  Rosika Parker suggests that 'heroic women who transcended in virtue all women and all humans' became a popular theme in Renaissance writing, and that they were increasingly portrayed as meek and domesticated figures. At this time, celebrations of the Assumption of the Virgin were increasingly embroidered on ecclesiastical vestments , complementing her image as Mary the mother. In this representation, the architectural sets and the scenes with her parents undoubtedly stress her humanity as well as the importance of her role as the mother of Jesus Christ.

Occasionally, as in this example, their motifs included the figures of the donors.The figures can be identified by their names embroidered in the scrolls above them, but unfortunately nothing more is known about these individuals.

The dates of the figures are indicated by their clothing, the ones above being in dress of a slightly earlier period than the younger couple seen below. Henry Smyth, the husband in the upper pair, has the characteristic 'bowl crop' haircut that went out of  fashion around 1460, though the style still appears occasionally after that date.  His shoes are high around the ankle and cut with a deep 'V', in a fashion of the second half of the 15th century. Johanna or Joan, his wife wears a loose-fitting gown with a long train, a style that dates from around 1450-1470.The man below, Thomas Smyth, has a 'pageboy' haircut.

The cuffs and skirts of all the figures have scalloped  borders in gold. Although still bright and fairly fresh looking, the colours have faded. The gowns of the two lower figures were originally red but are now a dull cream. The yellows and greens were brighter as well, and the blue velvet background had a much deeper hue.

Nicolas-Louis Robert and his brother Anne-Jean and Joseph Montgolfier. 

The public spectacles of balloon flights in France, England and other parts of Europe were widely disseminated through academic papers, journal reports, pamphlets, poetry and consumer items, such as textiles and ceramics.  This waistcoat was probably embroidered as a ‘shape’ that was sold to the wearer, who had his tailor make it into a waistcoat.  Given the popularity of the balloon phenomenon, such a shape could have sold widely throughout Europe.  This waistcoat may have been made in England (where the Italian aeronaut, Vicenzo Lunardi, demonstrated his hydrogen balloon in London in 1784).

They are the work of Mary Queen of Scots, during her imprisonment in England and Elizabeth (Bess) Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury.  Bess's husband George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury was responsible for Mary and she stayed at one or other of the Shrewsbury estates.   

Embroidery was a form of therapy and communication for Mary, as well as a conventional occupation for wealthy and elite women.  Most of the motifs depicted were copied from the wood-cut illustrations of emblem books and natural histories by well-known authors such as Claud Paradin, Conrad Gessner, Pierre Belon. These often represented sentiments and morals from classical literature and contemporary folklore, and were chosen by Mary to express her most private thoughts at a time when all her written correspondence was being monitored by her captors.

This work is known as the 'Marian' hanging, because the embroideries relate most directly to her.  It comprises individual panels of canvas work (stitching over the threads of a coarsely woven linen) in coloured silks, silver and silver-gilt thread, mounted on green velvet. The central panel bears the inscription VIRESCIT VULNERE VIRTUS (Virtue flourishes by wounding) with the royal arms of Scotland and Mary's monogram, the letters MA superimposed on the Greek letter phi. A version of this panel was sent to the Earl of Norfolk who was planning to marry Mary and supplant Queen Elizabeth.  

There are eight octagonal and 28 smaller, cross-shaped panels depicting various plants, birds, animals and fish, 18 of which bear Mary's monogram. Not all the panels were embroidered by her, as household accounts show that she had professional embroiderers as part of her retinue. The existing 'hangings' are not the original arrangement of the embroidery.  They may have originally served as cushion covers or smaller hangings; Mary frequently sent embroideries as gifts to friends and supporters, as well as Queen Elizabeth.

The embroideries were given to Ann Dacre, Countess of Arundel, daughter-in-law of the Duke of Norfolk who was executed in 1574 for his plot against Queen Elizabeth.  It is thought that the current arrangement of wall hanging, two bed curtains and valance was put together in the late 17th century by Ann Dacre's daughter-in-law, Alathea Talbot, granddaughter of Bess, Countess of Shrewsbury. The hangings made their way through descendants of the Arundels to Cowdray Park.  In 1761, the hangings came to Oxburgh Hall. They were purchased by the National Art Collections Fund in 1955.

They are the work of Mary Queen of Scots during her imprisonment in England and Elizabeth (Bess) Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury. Bess's husband George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury was responsible for Mary and she stayed at one or other of the Shrewsbury estates.   

This work is known as the 'Shrewsbury' hanging, as it bears several of Bess's monograms. It comprises individual panels of canvas work (stitching over the threads of a coarsely woven linen) in coloured silks, silver and silver-gilt thread, mounted on green velvet. The central panel bears the inscription INGENII LARGITOR (Bestower of wit).  There are four octagonal panels (one with the monogram ETS - Elizabeth Talbot Shrewsbury) and 20 smaller, cross-shaped panels, depicting various plants, birds, animals and fish. Several are signed 'ES', while one bears Mary's monogram, the letters MA superimposed on the Greek letter phi.  

Most of the motifs depicted were copied from the wood-cut illustrations of emblem books and natural histories by well-known authors such as Claud Paradin, Conrad Gessner, Pierre Belon. These often represented sentiments and morals from classical literature and contemporary folklore. Not all the panels were embroidered by Mary or Bess, as household accounts show that both had professional embroiderers on staff. The existing 'hangings' are not the original arrangement of the embroidery. They may have first served as cushion covers or smaller hangings for Bess's various houses, while Mary frequently sent embroideries as gifts to friends and supporters, as well as Queen Elizabeth.

The embroideries were given to Ann Dacre, Countess of Arundel, daughter-in-law of the Duke of Norfolk who was executed in 1574 for plotting to marry Mary and supplant Queen Elizabeth. It is thought that the current arrangement of wall hanging, two bed curtains and valance was put together in the late 17th century by Ann Dacre's daughter-in-law, Alathea Talbot, granddaughter of Bess, Countess of Shrewsbury.

This richly embroidered waistcoat is an example of lavish European court dress. The bright yellow colour was fashionable for both men and women. The generous length and the pocket flaps allowed for rich decoration. The design includes Rococo motifs such as a sinuous pattern of scrolling leaves, but the bold treatment and large scale of the vegetation are more characteristic of the earlier Baroque style. The metal threads, when new, would have created a glittering effect.

The length of the waistcoat and the sumptuous embroidery and are both characteristic of the period and the rich yellow of the dyed satin was fashionable in men’s and women’s dress from the 1730s until the 1780s. 

The waistcoat is embellished with embroidery in coloured silk and silver threads of several textures. The decorative pattern incorporates large stylised exotic flowers and leaves with feathered scrolls, arranged in broad borders down each front, over the pocket flaps and the front of the waistcoat skirts.

The scale of the embroidery pattern, its range of textures and use of metallic threads are reminiscent of the Baroque style, commanding splendid effects in rich materials. However, the design demonstrates characteristic Rococo elements of scrolls, naturalistic ornament and extravagant forms; with the regular sinuous pattern of ornate scroll shaped leaves and diapered infilling introducing the lighter grace of the Rococo style.

This waistcoat is unusually opulent as the expensive satin has been used not only for the front of the garment but also for the back and the three-quarter length sleeves, neither of which would have been visible when worn with a coat.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

The back is made of one width of the silk, pleated and shaped to form the back of the bodice and extending into the train.  On either side of it, below the waist, is a tapering rectangle made of 3 pieces of silk, to form the gathering of the mantua at the back.  The upper piece also forms the bodice fronts, one pleat of the robings extending into one of the pleats at the back. The bodice is lined with linen.  On the side seams below the waist on the inside are two loops of silver cord, with corresponding silver buttons on the right side, for draping the mantua.  The mantua is embroidered to shape, the bodice, sleeves and cuffs, worked  and scaled to accommodate their pleats and shaping.  The train and its side panels are worked on the wrong side (relative to the bodice), but to show correctly when the mantua is properly arranged.  

The petticoat is made of 7 widths of silk, embroidered over 6 seams, with the final seam after embroidery at the right back.  There is an opening in the middle of the centre back panel.  The petticoat is lined with red silk taffeta and the hem bound with a woven silver lace (braid).  Its original shape was probably for a wide, square hoop.

The coat has a narrow binding of broadcloth at the neck.  The sleeves are cut in two, curved pieces, to fit loosely, ending above the wrist, with a cuff 14 cm deep at the front and 16 cm deep at the back.  The torso is cut to fit tightly with wide skirts below the hip, with 3 pleats (12 cm deep) in the back and front of the coat, on either side.  The coat is lined with red silk twill, with a stiff interlining (unseen) in between, down the front edges.  The coat has 15 buttons on the right front and 15 buttonholes on the left front.  Only the centre 5 buttonholes have been cut; the bottom 4 and top 6 are uncut. Each coat front curves slightly from the neck edge to the 4th button/hole down. There is a curved rectangular pocket flap on each front, with a red silk twill lined pocket. The coat is decorated with silver embroidery on either side of the front.  Seven uncut buttonholes of silver thread edge the skirt opening at centre back, and 4 on each pocket flap with buttons on the coat underneath.  The  side edge of the coat fronts is also worked with silver embroidery. There is silver embroidery along the top edge of the cuffs and 3 buttonholes with 3 corresponding buttons.  The buttons are passementerie, with silver thread, purl and silver-thread-wrapped strip, over a solid core.  A worked button holds the pleats top at the top and bottom on each side (the bottom left button is missing).

The breeches are cut in 4 shaped pieces, low at the front waist and high at the back.  The waistband is cut in two pieces, deeper at the front than the back.  The back of the legs is gathered into the waistband; there are two worked buttonholes on either side of the waistband at the back for fastening.   There are 2 buttons on the right waistband and3 buttonholes on a band of wool attached to centre front left leg, with corresponding buttonholes on the left.  There is button pocket flap on either side of the front.  There is a pocket opening in each side seam.  The outside of each leg fastens with 5 silver-worked buttons and 5 cut silver-embroidered buttonholes (3 missing on the left, 3 on the right). The bottom edge of each leg is bound with red wool.   The breeches are lined with brushed, twill fustian.  The pockets are made of chamois leather and edged with red silk twill around the pocket openings.  The waistband and openings with buttons and buttonholes are interlined with buckram.  

The coat has been mended during the early 18th century.  The left skirts of the coat, front and back were replaced with red broadcloth of a slightly brighter shade.  There is a small area of replacement with the same at the back of the right skirt.  The red silk twill lining in these areas was not replaced.  The fronts of the coat were relined with red silk twill of a slightly different shade as the original lining.   

The breeches were altered for fancy dress in the mid-19th century, probably to accommodate a wearer with larger legs.  An insertion of the original lining was added to each leg opening, with a triangle of red flannel over top. The binding of the leg openings was converted to a casing for black cotton tape drawstrings.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

The coat is worn quite short and has very wide skirts carefully pleated into the side seams. The sleeves are loosely fitted with wide cuffs. Red was a fashionable colour for men, along with deep blue and more subdued shades of grey and brown. The small size of this outfit suggests it would have been worn by a young man or older boy. The back skirts of the coat were extensively repaired at a later date.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

Each front has a pocket and pointed pocket flap.  The fronts, back skirts, pocket flaps and cuffs are made of pale yellow silk taffeta with a chequered weave; the sleeves of yellow silk satin and the back pieced with yellow silk satin and yellow silk/linen.  The waistcoat and sleeves are lined with linen twill; the skirts with ivory worsted, the linings of the pockets, pocket flaps and cuffs and front facings are ivory silk twill. The fronts are woven-to-shape with silver thread, frisé, strip and silk threads in white, black and shades of green red, pink, blue and purple, in a pattern of large flowers and leaves, along the front edges and hems. There is a seam at the waist of each front, where the woven pattern was cut, possibly to adjust for length. There are 17 worked buttonholes on a strip of the yellow taffeta under the left front edge and 1 on each cuff.  There are 17 corresponding buttons of silver passementerie on the right front, 5 below each pocket and 1 on each cuff.

The separate pocket flaps are scalloped and made of the yellow chequered silk taffeta.  Each is brocaded-to-shape with silver thread, frisé and the same coloured silks as the waistcoat.  The design is an adaptation of that on the waistcoat.  It appears that these were not used on the waistcoat, which instead has pocket flaps made of 2 pieces taken from the front border.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"

This suit of wool instead of silk, with only a narrow trimming of braid, is an example of the new restraint evident in men’s clothing. By 1760 the fronts of the coat were starting to curve back. The side pleats are less voluminous than they were earlier in the century. The waistcoat has shortened to mid-thigh length, and the sleeves are cut more tightly than in the 1750s. A small upright collar appears on the formal day-coat after 1760.","http://data.silknow.org/vocabulary/628"
