1,"Woman's kaftan. The fabric is silk woven with stripes on a cream ground; narrow stripes of gold thread alternate with broader stripes of delicate floral sprays, also in gold thread. In its present state, the skirt is gathered onto the bodice with a restraining braid around the waist. There is evidence of a coarse cotton lining (which has been cut away). There is a slit on either side of the skirt, bound with a metal braid, to provide access to pockets. The bodice is fitted. The sleeves are long and hang loose from the elbow. Both bodice and skirt are further decorated with couched metal braid which has been strengthened on the reverse by stitching through paper. Some of this appears to be an ink-written letter in Greek. 

Yellow ribbons may have been added at a later date to provide a fastening down the centre front.",'gold thread',silver

4,"Many decorative early 17th century bags survive, but it is not entirely certain how they were used and worn. They are too delicate and elaborate to serve as receptacles for money carried on one's person on a daily basis.  Few commercial exchanges in the early 17th century required cash, and most household shopping was done by servants.  However, they were used as a form of gift-wrapping for the presents of coin that were offered as a New Year's gifts to the monarch.  

These embroidered bags may also be the 'sweet bags' frequently listed in inventories and offered as gifts.  These held perfumed powder or dried flowers and herbs, and were perhaps applied to the nose like a pomander when necessary.

The pattern of flowers and fruits is typical of English embroidery designs in the early 17th century.  Embroidery pattern books of the period feature a range of flowers and fruits, inspired by illustrated botanical books and herbals.",'silver thread',silver

10,"Man’s waistcoat with a round neck, curving 2-piece sleeves, curved fronts and skirts reaching to between the top of the knee and mid-thigh.  Each front has a pocket and pointed pocket flap.  The fronts, back skirts, pocket flaps and cuffs are made of pale yellow silk taffeta with a chequered weave; the sleeves of yellow silk satin and the back pieced with yellow silk satin and yellow silk/linen.  The waistcoat and sleeves are lined with linen twill; the skirts with ivory worsted, the linings of the pockets, pocket flaps and cuffs and front facings are ivory silk twill. The fronts are woven-to-shape with silver thread, frisé, strip and silk threads in white, black and shades of green red, pink, blue and purple, in a pattern of large flowers and leaves, along the front edges and hems. There is a seam at the waist of each front, where the woven pattern was cut, possibly to adjust for length. There are 17 worked buttonholes on a strip of the yellow taffeta under the left front edge and 1 on each cuff.  There are 17 corresponding buttons of silver passementerie on the right front, 5 below each pocket and 1 on each cuff.

24,"This embroidered crimson silk twill cloth is an epitaphios. An epitaphios is a large cloth carried in procession in the Good Friday services and for which the early term was Great Aër. The decoration, with the body of the dead Christ accompanied by angels with fans and with the symbols or figures of the evangelists in the corners, is of conventional form. In this example, the verses from the troparion emphasise the Good Friday theme. The dedication also mentions <i>Prayer of the servant of God Nicholas Eudaimonoioannes with his wife and children in the year 6915</i><i> <I>[<i>1407</i>]</I>.</i> The Nicholas mentioned here may well be the Nicholas Eudaimonoioannes who acted as Manuel II's ambassador to the Venetians in 1416 and was one of his delegates to the Council of Constantine in 1414-17. 

The Eudaimonoioannes family held an important place in the history of the Morea (the Peloponnese), as archons of Monemvasia from the 13th century until the Turkish conquest. The epitaphios was probably commissioned for donation to a church in Nicholas' native Morea.

142,"In the 17th century decorative purses such as this one were rarely used to carry money, as their wealthy owners engaged in few commercial exchanges requiring cash.  In addition to serving as 'sweet bags' or 'gift wrapping', purses sometimes functioned as sewing kits that held needles, thread and tiny scissors.  The attachment of a pin cushion to this purse suggests that it might have been used as a sewing kit, or kept on the dressing table to hold pins for fastening clothing.

The purse and pin cushion are made of satin and embroidered in a pattern of birds and flowers with silver thread, silver-gilt purl (tiny tubes of tightly coiled metal) and freshwater pearls.  Both purse and pin cushion have a string of flat braid of beige silk, to attach them to a belt if required.",'silver thread',silver

148,"Now on permanent loan to Oxburgh Hall, in Norfolk, these embroideries were made between 1569 and about 1585.  They are the work of Mary Queen of Scots, during her imprisonment in England and Elizabeth (Bess) Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury.  Bess's husband George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury was responsible for Mary and she stayed at one or other of the Shrewsbury estates.   

Embroidery was a form of therapy and communication for Mary, as well as a conventional occupation for wealthy and elite women.  Most of the motifs depicted were copied from the wood-cut illustrations of emblem books and natural histories by well-known authors such as Claud Paradin, Conrad Gessner, Pierre Belon. These often represented sentiments and morals from classical literature and contemporary folklore, and were chosen by Mary to express her most private thoughts at a time when all her written correspondence was being monitored by her captors.

This work is known as the 'Marian' hanging, because the embroideries relate most directly to her.  It comprises individual panels of canvas work (stitching over the threads of a coarsely woven linen) in coloured silks, silver and silver-gilt thread, mounted on green velvet. The central panel bears the inscription VIRESCIT VULNERE VIRTUS (Virtue flourishes by wounding) with the royal arms of Scotland and Mary's monogram, the letters MA superimposed on the Greek letter phi. A version of this panel was sent to the Earl of Norfolk who was planning to marry Mary and supplant Queen Elizabeth.  

There are eight octagonal and 28 smaller, cross-shaped panels depicting various plants, birds, animals and fish, 18 of which bear Mary's monogram. Not all the panels were embroidered by her, as household accounts show that she had professional embroiderers as part of her retinue. The existing 'hangings' are not the original arrangement of the embroidery.  They may have originally served as cushion covers or smaller hangings; Mary frequently sent embroideries as gifts to friends and supporters, as well as Queen Elizabeth.

The embroideries were given to Ann Dacre, Countess of Arundel, daughter-in-law of the Duke of Norfolk who was executed in 1574 for his plot against Queen Elizabeth.  It is thought that the current arrangement of wall hanging, two bed curtains and valance was put together in the late 17th century by Ann Dacre's daughter-in-law, Alathea Talbot, granddaughter of Bess, Countess of Shrewsbury. The hangings made their way through descendants of the Arundels to Cowdray Park.  In 1761, the hangings came to Oxburgh Hall. They were purchased by the National Art Collections Fund in 1955. Unable to give them directly to the National Trust, the NACF donated the hangings to the V&A Museum, on condition they remain at Oxburgh.",'silver thread',gold

The chapel, which is now in ruins, was the burial place of the Sandys family. At the time when the hanging was made, the head of the family was Henry Sandys 5th Baron, who was killed in a Civil War skirmish in 1644. When the Revd Joseph of Basingstoke described the hanging in 1819, it was in Mottisfont House in Hampshire, where it belonged to Sir Charles Mill Bartholemew, a descendent of the Sandys Family.

The remainder of the chapel fittings are also enumerated, from a description given by  the steward to the Mottisfont Estate, Thomas King. They consisted of an altar frontal embroidered with the Last Supper, some pieces of purple velvet with the initials IHS, a desk hanging of purple velvet embroidered in gold and silver with the arms of Sandys, two book covers and a folding cushion with the letters 'THS' on the outside and the arms of Sandys on the inside.

The flat, circular base with sides gathered on a drawstring prevented spilling or revealing the contents, and the coat of arms on the bottom identified the owner. 

This gaming purse is made of velvet dyed a bright orange-red, a colour known in the 18th century as ‘tawny’.  It is embroidered with fleur-de-lys in silver thread on the sides.  The coat of arms of Cardinal Duke de Matignon are embroidered in silk and silver gilt on the bottom.

Playing and betting on card games was a socially acceptable pastime for the wealthy in the later 17th century.  Along with dancing, riding and the theatre, it was an amusement for those classes that did not have to work. The coat of arms identify the owner of the purse as Jacques de Goyon de Matignon who was consecrated Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church in Paris in 1673. The evidence that he regularly played and gambled on cards is appropriate to his aristocratic birth.  Unlike certain sects of the Protestantism in the 17th century, the Roman Catholic Church did not oppose this popular entertainment.",'silver thread',gold

Many were solely decorative, to display the wealth and status of their owner. They were worn in the hat or belt, as well as carried in the hand. Gloves were popular as gifts and were exchanged as a gesture of engagement or wedding present. In combat, a glove was thrown down as a gage, or challenge.

Decorative gloves were popular with England’s working class. In 1618 Horatio Busini, chaplain to the Venetian ambassador to England, wrote disapprovingly in a report on English customs:  “all wear very costly gloves.  This fashion of gloves is so universal that even the porters wear them very ostentatiously.”

The decoration of this glove is characteristic of the period 1615 to 1625 with couched embroidery in a stylised pattern and fringe of metal thread.",'silver thread',gold
207,"In the 19th century gloves were an indispensable accessory for women. They were worn for day and evening wear. Wealthy women owned many pairs suited to different occasions and carefully chosen to match particular outfits. Strict rules applied to the wearing of gloves. A woman would be considered undressed if she left the house ungloved and it was customary, for instance, to keep gloves on in church, at the theatre and at balls but to remove them before dining.

These embroidered white kid gloves are typical of day gloves worn by women in the 1830s and 40s. The fashion for pale coloured soft kid leather was the subject of much discussion in etiquette manuals. It was considered extremely bad form to wear discoloured or worn gloves, leading some to claim they 'can only be worn once'. This particular pair appear to be unworn as there is no sign of the stretching required to wear such close fitting items. The glove pattern is cut with 'quirks' (a piece which fitted at the base of the thumb) and 'fourchettes' (the side panels for the fingers), and they would have been fastened by a single button at the wrist, which is missing on the right hand. There is no pointing on the backs of the hands as these were left plain in order to accommodate the floral design. This extremely fine hand embroidery is near identical on both left and right and forms a concentrated design over the back of the hand, typical of the period. The design is stitched in coloured silk with silver thread used for the foliage.",'silver thread',gold

214,"A number of beaded bags from the early 17th century survive.  Their stylized floral patterns and less expensive materials imitate the elaborate embroidered versions carried by the aristocracy.  Many bear mottos or expressions relating to charity, friendship or luck, which suggests that they may have been used for gifts of money.  This example is inscribed 'heare et is hit or miss'.

The development of the 'drawn-glass' technique about 1490 allowed the manufacture of large numbers of small, round, coloured beads with a central hole, of the type used in this purse. The glassworks on the island of Murano near Venice were the most famous during the Renaissance, but by the early 17th century the technology had spread to glass-making centres in Amsterdam and Bavaria.  Beads were produced mainly for trade with North America and Africa, but they were also sold in Europe for use in embroidery.

The expression 'hit or miss' is first recorded in the English language in William Shakespeare's play <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> published in 1606, where it has the same meaning of random luck that it has today.  The expression may have derived from a country dance also known as 'hit and miss', recorded as early as 1626.",'silver thread',gold

It is lined with a thin grey-brown watered silk.

Princes' Kaftans from Ottoman Turkey

These three kaftans (and another in a nearby case) were worn by Ottoman princes who died when they were children. They were preserved in imperial tombs where, in accordance with Ottoman custom, they were placed over the graves of the deceased.

The kaftans may have come from the graves of the 19 younger sons of Sultan Murat III, who were executed at the succession of their half-brother, Mehmet III, in 1595. This gory practice, designed to avoid a struggle for the succession, was never repeated.

The kaftans, woven of silk and metal-wrapped thread, show that even in childhood, Ottoman princes were dressed in the same lavish style as the sultan and his courtiers. The wide range of designs of the time include a meandering vine set with tulips, which clearly influenced contemporary embroidery (see case opposite).

281,"Silk ribbons were used for a multitude of utilitarian and decorative purposes in 18th-century fashionable dress – for the ornamentation of women’s gowns, for garters to keep up stockings, for lacing for stays and shoes, for tying back wigs and ornamenting elaborate hairstyles and headdresses.  Diderot’s <i>Encyclopaedia</i> in 1772 described these uses succinctly in its definition of ribbon: ‘a flat, narrow and thin fabric, used to tie, edge or ornament, for garments as well as furnishings’. Ribbons were subject to changes in fashion, just as wide silks were. 

Ribbons could be bought at fairs, from travelling pedlars or from the high class retailers of major cities such as Paris (e.g. the <i>marchands merciers </i>of the Faubourg St Honoré which is still the city's luxury quarter today). These retailers stocked large quantities of ribbons of all sorts - from the simplest to the most elaborate - to sell to their customers, French ribbons being complemented by Dutch, Flemish, German and Swiss goods.",'silver thread',silver

287,"Gloves could serve several purposes in early 17th century Britain, apart from the obvious ones of protection and warmth.  Many were solely decorative, to display the wealth and status of their owner. They were worn in the hat or belt, as well as carried in the hand. Gloves were popular as gifts and were exchanged as a gesture of engagement or wedding present. In combat, a glove was thrown down as a gage, or challenge.

Decorative gloves were popular with England’s working class. In 1618 Horatio Busini, chaplain to the Venetian ambassador to England, wrote disapprovingly in a report on English customs:  “all wear very costly gloves.  This fashion of gloves is so universal that even the porters wear them very ostentatiously.”

The decoration of this pair is characteristic of the period 1615 to 1625 with couched embroidery in a stylised pattern and fringe of metal thread.",'silver thread',gold
