Animal Pelt Designs
Pairs of wavy lines and groups of three large dots represent the pelts of the striped tiger and spotted leopard. In the Islamic world, the designs acquired powerful associations. The Iranian hero Rustam, for example, is usually depicted wearing a tiger-skin coat. 

By 1500, these designs were popular on Ottoman Turkish textiles, and were often combined. They soon appeared in other media, such as tilework. 

The triple-dot design has been confused with the Buddhist ‘precious jewel’ motif (Sanskrit cintamani), which is sometimes shown in groups of three. But there is no connection.

It was probably made in the 1750s, when such chairs were the height of fashion.  Cosway probably bought the chair second-hand in about 1770. He used the chair in several paintings. 

The chair was used as a prop for the painting 'Charles Townley with a group of connoisseurs', 1771-1775, now in Towneley Hall Art Gallery and Museums, Burnely.

A sitter in another Cosway portrait showing the chair is Elizabeth - or Eliza - Draper (1744-1778), best known for her friendship with the British author Laurence Sterne (1713-1768). Mrs Draper lived in India for most of her life, and met Sterne in 1767, when she was visiting England. Sterne mentioned Mrs Draper in ‘A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy’ published in 1768.  He also wrote a ‘Journal to Eliza’ which was published long after his death.  Mrs Draper again visited England in the mid-1770s, when Cosway painted her sitting in this chair. 

The chair has been covered in modern silk damask (2001), copying the upholstery which is visible in Draper portrait. The stuffing gives rounded profiles to the seat, back and arms.

A pencil drawing in the V&amp;A collection (Museum no.2848:149) by Matthias Lock (ca. 1710-1765) appears to be the design for this chair. Lock, as well as designing and making his own furniture, also supplied some of the furniture designs for Thomas Chippendale's book ‘The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director’, published in 1754.","Damask"

This chair appears in several portraits painted by Richard Cosway (1742-1821).  It epitomises the Rococo style in English furniture.  It matches an undated drawing by the carver and designer Matthias Lock. The outlines of the chair are entirely composed of curves and the legs show the fashionable, curving 'cabriole' form with naturalistically carved paw feet.

ARMCHAIR 
ENGLISH; about 1760
Carved and gilt wood

Designed and carved by Matthias Lock (d.1765).  This chair was at one time in the possession of the artist Richard Cosway (d.1821) and appears in three of his portraits. [pre October 2000]
This chair appears in a portrait attributed to Richard Cosway, of Elizabeth Draper (1744-1778), better known as Stern's 'Immortal Eliza'. It is one of the finest known examples of the type known as 'French chairs', designs for which were published in Chippendale's <font -u>Gentleman and Cabinetmaker's Director</font>. [pre 1980]
A highly important carved and gilt-wood rococo open armhair of asymtetrical form; the cabriole legs with hary paw feet in front and volutes at the rear, the cartouche shaped back, arms and seat rails excellently carved with acanthus scrolls, C scrolls and flame ornaments.  English, circa 1760
Note:
This chair is stylistically very close to some of the so-called 'French Chairs' in Chippendale's 'Director' drawing book.  The carver, in this case, has used limewood for the back and arms and pine for the legs and seat rails.  The extremely high quality of the carving and the subtlety and sophistication of the design certainly does not preclude a possible attribution to the workshop of Thomas Chippendale.  There is, however, no positive evidence to support this. [pre 1990]","Damask"

"http://data.silknow.org/object/37c99ede-54e4-3e6f-9ea2-32ad60ed7a79","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","Side chairs were designed for dining or playing at cards. When not in use, they were placed against the wall, where the elaborate backs created a decorative effect.

The back of this chair is inspired by a design in Thomas Chippendale's The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director (Plate XII, 1754 and 1755 editions, Plate XIII, repeated in Plate XIV, 3rd edition, 1762).  The 'pedestal' or shoe for the back splat of one of this set of six chairs (W.62-1940) is inscribed in pencil '6 pedistals for Chipendels backs'.  It is likely that the maker was simply following Chippendale's published designs, rather than working for the firm.  The quality of the carving is not good enough for the chairs to have been made by the Chippendale firm.

Many versions were made by furniture makers throughout Britain and overseas, in a wide range of qualities. Without evidence from bills and inventories it is impossible to date such chairs closely. We know that workshops were producing chairs of this pattern more than 30 years after the 'Director' was published. When chairs were made following Director patterns, as in this example, it is only the back that is copied from the published plate. The seat and legs tend to be treated much more conventionally.

Chippendale's notes to the plate recommend that the design should be carefully drawn to scale before carving. He indicates that the fabric used to cover such chairs usually matches the window curtains. The height of the chair back should never be more than 22 inches (56 centimetres) above that of the seat. The mahogany would have been imported from the West Indies.

As such, the animal seen here likely represents the Buddhist six-tusked elephant described in a fifth-century Chinese translation of a sutra as being resplendent and white and having lotuses, jade maidens, and other symbolic figures at the end of each tusk.²Elephants have a long history in China. Given as tribute to the emperor by local rulers, particularly from neighboring Southeast Asian regions where they were raised, elephants were also presented as diplomatic gifts to important foreign kings. Apart from their use as work animals and army transport, they were sometimes tamed to provide entertainment in times of leisure, beloved by the royal courts. In sixteenth-century Europe, elephants held a similar fascination for royals and commoners alike, and they appear in the works of such artists as Durer and Raphael. Shipped by boat from Ceylon to Lisbon, elephants were offered as gifts of the Portuguese kings to the courts of Spain, Austria, France, and England. In 1514, Manuel I of Portugal gave a white elephant (the famous ""Hanno"" known through Raphael's drawings) to Pope Leo X.  An  elephant given by the court of Lisbon to Philip II of Spain in 1581 was subsequently passed along to Henry IV of France.  A year later Henry, in turn, gve it to Queen Elizabeth of England, a brillia;nt ""re-gifting"" of an asset deemed too expensive to maintain.³ Here the combination of Buddhist symbols and Habsburg eagles produces a composite message of a religious and political nature that juxtaposes the two cultures of Asia and Europe.  We do not know how long this long-preserved length of fabric was originally used, but its delicate quality indicates that it may have been part of a garment or hanging.⁴Woven in China and likely exported through the port of Macau, this textile's blend of Asian and European taste and style was intended for a foreign market that may not have understood the Buddhist elements but nonetheless would have appreciated the fine weaving and exotic designs.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1. The textile is composed of a five-harness satin damask, with a blue warp and yellow weft. The blue color is presumably indigo, while the yellow dye was made from the Asian pagoda tree (Sophora japonica). Dye analysis was conducted by Nobuko Shibayama in the Department of Scientific Research, Metropolitan Museum, with High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Photo Diode Array (HPLC-PDA). 2. “The creature is colossal . . . and is whiter than the snows of the Himalayas. At the ends of his six tusks are six bathing tanks, in each of which grow fourteen lotuses. On each open blossom is a ‘jade maiden’ fairer than the damsels of Paradise, in whose hands are five spontaneously created lutes; each lute is accompanied by 500 other musical instruments, and 500 jewel-colored birds.” Guan Puxian pu sa xing fa jing (Sutra on the Practice of Visualizing the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra), in Soper, “Literary Evidence for Early Buddhist Art in China,” p. 223. 3. See Bedini, The Pope’s Elephant, Gschwend and Bellet, The Story of Suleyman, and Lach, “The Elephant,” pp. 152 ? 58. 4. The panel comprises two widths of cloth seamed together: identical patterns that are somewhat mismatched at the join. A fragment of the white selvage with a blue stripe is preserved along the seam in two areas (visible at the back). Digby, “Some Silks Woven under Portuguese Influence in the Far East,” pp. 55 ? 56 and n. 11, notes that several Asian damasks from Macau have a white twill selvage with a stripe and that the structure of this selvage is distinct from other silks thought to be from Macau; the elephant silk conforms to the technical features of that group. Since we have little information as to the exact provenance of these textiles, technical features such as these can be important for identifying the potential locale of their production.","Damask"

Later, the precious bedcover was cut up, and portions were pieced together with a delicate quilted European floral silk to create the panel as it appears today.¹ Its relatively small size indicates that it may have served as a christening or bearing cloth for a child being carried to the baptismal font for christening.²  At the very center of the textile are three bands from the original coverlet, one with a roundel containing a scene of a man and a woman flanking a tree, perhaps inspired by traditional depictions of Adam and Eve. The blossoming tree grows from a large container decorated with a continuous pattern of hexagons, a Chinese design suggesting longevity, and on the tree is a bleeding heart pierced with arrows, a secular symbol referring to love and devotion in Renaissance Europe.³ The dress of the couple is generally consistent with that of late sixteenth to early seventeenth century Europe: the woman’s unstructured clothing is typical of the early seventeenth century, while the man’s hat conforms to late sixteenth-century examples.⁴ Their garments are overembroidered with repeating Chinese patterns, as if made to resemble Chinese silk damasks. The two other adjoining bands at the center of the panel were formerly one. If placed one directly above the other, they form a scene with a pair of ducks in a lotus pond. Although the lotus pond is an enduring theme in Chinese textiles, here the pattern shows a heightened emphasis on flower centers, common in Chinese export textiles, and another type of duck has been substituted for the pair of egrets or mandarin ducks more frequently found in a traditional Chinese image. Another part of the original coverlet was retained as the embroidered border of the present panel; while its sides were heavily pieced together, the ninety-degree corners were untouched in the piecing process, indicating that it served as a border in the original coverlet as well. The delicate, light peach-colored European textile chosen to surround the exotic portions of the cloth has a floral pattern typical of the last decades of the seventeenth century.⁵ The panel is fully lined in a white monochrome woven silk with a small floral pattern on a continuous fretwork background likely woven in China. Cloth of this type, termed rinzu, was exported from China to Japan in large quantities during the seventeenth century to be used as the foundation fabric of luxurious dyed and embroidered Japanese kimonos, until the Japanese started producing it themselves in the mid-Edo period, starting in the 1680s.⁶[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1.

Its original but now fragile hangings, woven in 1782–83 at the Beauvais tapestry manufactory after designs by Jean-Baptiste Huet (1745–1811), have been replaced by modern silk damask, except for the lining of the interior dome. French eighteenth-century beds tended to be lofty, as it was customary to pile them with three or more mattresses filled with straw, wool, horsehair, or feathers. Tobias Smollett (1721–1771) noted in 1766, “French beds are so high, that sometimes one is obliged to mount them by the help of steps.”[1]The custom of receiving visitors while reposing in a large and elegantly fitted out bed was practiced in France during the eighteenth century mostly by aristocratic women. The Museum’s imposing piece of furniture with its exquisitely carved floral decoration, the work of an unknown carver, must have formed a splendid backdrop for such official calls or congratulatory visits. In 1791 the bed is documented as standing in the large bedchamber of Guyonne-Marguerite de Durfort de Lorge, duchesse de Choiseul-Praslin (1737–1806), at her Parisian home, the Hôtel de Belle Isle. Following the turmoil of the Revolution and the political changes of the early nineteenth century, the bed was sold in Paris in 1830. It became part of the famous collections at Hamilton Palace, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the residence of Alexander Hamilton Douglas, tenth Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852), where it was placed in one of the state rooms. The duke’s grandson sold the contents of the palace, including the bed, at a highly anticipated auction that took place in 1882. Through the intermediation of several dealers, the bed was acquired in 1897 by the financier and railroad executive George J. Gould (1864–1923). His wife, the former actress Edith M. Kingdon (1864–1921), used it in her bedroom of their New York town house.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010]Footnotes:[1] Tobias George Smollett. Travels through France and Italy. London, 1766.

As soon as the aëronauts had taken their flight, I quitted the gardens.""[1] In his diary entry for December 1, 1783, Joseph Cradock (1742–1826) refers to the many spectators who watched a historic event take place that day: the first manned hydrogen balloon flight. The aeronauts Jacques-Alexandre-César Charles (1746–1823), a physicist, and his collaborator, Marie-Noël Robert (1760–1820), took off from the gardens of the Tuileries in a gondola suspended from a netted hydrogen balloon.Balloon-shaped and carved with netting, the finials of these side chairs, supplied for the queen’s boudoir at the Château des Tuileries in February 1784, celebrate Charles and Robert’s successful flight. Georges Jacob, one of the outstanding menuisiers of the ancien régime, provided the walnut frames, which he described as “of a new shape,” possibly referring to the arched top rail or the seat shaped like a horseshoe. The brothers Rousseau, who were decorative painters as well as sculptors, executed the delicate carving, each element of which is carefully detailed in their 1784 invoice. The chairs’ legs have the form of arrow-filled quivers, and the uprights of the back are shaped like fasces, or bundles of rods tied with ribbon, which symbolized power or authority in classical antiquity. The now little-known Presle, who advertised as “painter and gilder to the king,” gilded the frames. For certain details of the carving, such as the myrtle branches on the seat rails, a clear greenish tone of gilding was chosen to subtly contrast with the yellow gold used elsewhere.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010][1] Cradock 1828, vol. 2, pp. 38–39.","Damask"

1975 Desription: A man's tzute from Chichicastenango.  The man's headcloth is an old style one - they are now woven in red cotton.  Because the men's costume from this village is so spectacular, there are many illustrations in all the books mentioned in the other catalogue entries. These show how it is worn. 
The figures are not all birds - they are mostly animals.  This piece has a warp-faced plainweave white cotton ground.  The pattern is worked in double-faced brocading (also known as laid-in, loom embroidery etc).  Several pattern yarns are used together in each pick to give the design a thick quality.  The tzute is composed of two pieces woven on a backstrap loom and therefore with four selvedges.  there is an embrodiered seam (randa) down the centre.  

Technical Details (1995)

Lower Edge: appears to have been cut; rolled under and towards the back, secured with red cotton forming a zigzag, except for some blanket stitch at the right hand end.
Upper Edge: appears to have been cut; rolled under and towards the back, secured with red cotton in blanket sttich.
Brocading: number ofdifferent types/colours of thread = 4. The brocading threads usually begin with a knot on the back of the fabric; they are loosely plied threads which often fall into separate threads making them appear unplied. Red cotton (Z3S); orange cotton (Z4S); green cotton (Z4S), purple floss silk.
Randa: the two panels are joined edge-to-edge with blocks of red and faded orange cotton giving the effect of buttonhole stitch.
Tassels: one tassel attached to the upper and one to the lower left hand corners; each is (faded) purple floss silk and each is about 6"" long.

It is not uncommon to have the two halves of a huipil as different in size as these two are, as they were woven separately.  A similar garment made up of two such different sized panels is illustrated in L M O'Neal's 'Textiles of Highland Guatemala' plates 95a and 95b; see also p.304.
Plain weave ground made of natural undyed cotton known as CUYUSCATE or IXCACO (Gossypium Mexicanum). This cotton has always been highly valued by local weavers.  The woven design is both single faced and double faced brocade weaving done with white and mauve silk and several colours of cotton.  Several pattern yarns are used together in each pick so the pattern stands out from the ground cloth.  These pieces are woven on a backstrap loom and therefore have 4 selvedges each.

Dye Analysis (Carlsen and Wenger, undertaken 1988, published 1991):
The red cotton was dyed with Alizarin, the red silk was dyed with cochineal and the purple cotton with purpura.

1975 Description: One panel of a huipil from Totonicapan.  T.33 and T.34-1931 are not panels from a skirt but are two halves of an Indian blouse (huipil) from the village of Totonicapan or the surrounding area. They would have been sewn together with a hole cut out for the head and slits left in the side seams for the arms.  It is not uncommon to have the two halves of a huipil as different in size as these two are, as they were woven separately. A similar garment made up of two such different sized panels is illustrated by L M O'Neale in Textiles of the Highlands of Guatemala plates 95a and 95b; see also p.304.
Plain weave ground made of natural, undyed cotton known as CUYUSCATE or IXCACO (Gossypium Mexicanum).  This cotton has always been highly valued by local weavers.  The woven design is both single faced and double faced brocade weaving done with white and mauve silk and several colours of cotton.  Several pattern wefts are used together in each pick so the pattern stands out from the ground cloth.  These pieces are woven on a backstrap loom and therefore have 4 selvedges each.

Dye Analysis (Carlsen & Wenger, undertaken 1988, published 1991):
The red cotton isdyed with Alizarin.
The red wool is dyed with cochineal.
The purple cototn is dyed with purpura.

Technical Details (1995)
Warp: 46 threads per inch; brown cotton; Z-spun, unplied.
Weft: 24 threads per inch; brown cotton; Z-spun, unplied.
There is some red cotton weft (Z2S) loosely spun which has relaxed and looks like 2 parallel threads along the lower and upper edges. There are loosely packed weft threads about 1"" from the lower edge as numbered.
Lower Edge: 9 passes of red cotton.
Upper Edge: 10 passes of red cotton.
Brocading: 8 different types/colours of thread: red cotton (Z7S); yellow cotton (Z5S); yellow floss silk (faded to cream); light green cotton (Z7S); dark blue cotton (Z4S); purple cotton (S3Z - probably machine spun, tightly and regularly twisted); light purple floss silk; white floss silk.
Note: the number of threads plied together does vary and suggests that the weaver used whatever combination took her fancy.

Possibly these two panels were not intended for the same huipil as there is a difference not only in the size but also in the deisgn, number of colours, types of thread and ground colour.  But perhaps it didn't matter to the purchaser.","Brocaded"

This jacket’s lavish silk-and-gold fabric was probably made in Ahmedabad or Surat, the main weaving centres of Gujarat. Silk-and-gold textiles have been produced there for at least 500 years. On a richly coloured, glossy satin ground, these textiles typically have repeated motifs in metal-wrapped thread, often with a distinctive diagonal weave.

SILK BROCADES

One of the aims of the Great Exhibition of 1851 was to improve British manufacturing by providing examples of good design to inspire manufacturers. The Indian Court displayed fine woollen shawls from Kashmir, delicate muslins from Bengal and silk brocades from Ahmedabad. Visitors admired the Indian textiles for their exquisite craftsmanship, pattern and colour - qualities that mass manufactured British products had lost.

"http://data.silknow.org/object/0f3fff28-491b-3966-8c6e-b350e221ecc1","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","Damask is a type of weave whose effect depends on the differing play of light on its pattern surfaces, which alternate between the smooth face and the contrasting reverse of satin weave. Damask-weaving evolved in China, and was imported into Europe, where Italian silk weavers adopted the technique, sometimes incorporating Eastern design elements into their own textiles. Often these textiles were made of silk.

The majority of Italian 14th-century silk designs fall into the category of ""pomegranate patterns"" – a description coined in the nineteenth century. They are seen most frequently in the period between 1420 and 1550, and vary in composition and form. Often, the ""pomegranate"" resembles more closely a pine cone, a thistle, a lotus flower, or a pineapple.  In this example, the pomegranate design is not dominant, yet is still present, the main element of the pattern being a multi-foil shape containing a clump of flowers. 

This textile was bought in the nineteenth century from a church in Germany. It had  probably been used for ecclesiastical purposes. Portraits from the period show, however, that similar designs could also be used for secular, fashionable dress.","Damask"

"http://data.silknow.org/object/0f3fff28-491b-3966-8c6e-b350e221ecc1","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","Damask is a figured silk which uses one warp and one weft, where the pattern is created by a contrast in weaving styles and textures. One part of the design is usually matte, the other shiny. The design appears in reverse on the opposite side. Damask evolved in China, and was imported to Europe, where Italian silk weavers adopted the technique, sometimes incorporating Eastern design elements into their own textiles.

The majority of Italian 14th century textiles fall into the category of ""pomegranate patterns"" – a term coined in the nineteenth century. There are many variants on the theme of the ""pomegranate"", such as the patterns that incorporate the design. Often, the ""pomegranate"" resembles more closely a pinecone, a thistle, a lotus flower, or a pineapple. Pomegranate patterns are seen most frequently in the period c. 1420 to 1550. They seem to dominate textile production to such a degree that non-""pomegranate"" designs tend to be overshadowed. Even in this example, where the pomegranate design is not the dominant element, it is still present. The main element of the pattern is a multi-foil shape containing a clump of flowers. This motif has been cut in half by the selvedge, and would have been matched to the corresponding side of the design when sewn together for use. An example of this can be seen in 1339-1864.

Bronzino's portrait of Eleanor of Toledo, painted in the early 16th century, shows how a half-motif in such fabric would have been used by itself. Her sleeves are made up from long rectangles of a large-motif figured velvet. The motif is cut precisely down the middle by the edge of the fabric, the selvedge is then covered by a border of trimming. This method of cutting the pattern pieces straight maximised economy in the use of fabric. In the early 15th century Devonshire Tapestries (T.202 to 205-1957), courtly figures are depicted lifesize, wearing sumptuous garments with large-scale patterns and motifs. Many of these are in monochrome textiles, and while the patterns are rather bolder and simpler than the example here, they show damask type designs.

While this fabric has an ecclesiastical provenance, it is a type of fabric that would have been worn for secular dress as well. Several books on 14th and 15th century dress provide evidence of richly dressed figures portrayed in fabrics almost exclusively based upon leaves, flowers, and the ""pomegranate"" design. It is quite difficult to find depictions of patterns that are not dominated by ""pomegranate"" motifs, but the central figure in ""A Female Saint with a Donor and Two Women"", by the Master of the Baroncelli Portraits, c.1490, shows a similar type of damask to this one in her dress.

It might have been chosen for a woman's gown or a man's waistcoat or nightgown, worn informally at home. The complexity of its woven structure would have made it expensive. Its bold pattern and distinctive colouring date it to a fairly brief period around 1700 when such a combination was highly fashionable. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries the increasing import trade and other contacts between Asia and Europe greatly influenced the design of fashionable silks such as this. As well as the textiles themselves in clear, bright colours, other goods such as porcelain and lacquer lent shapes and motifs to the silk designer's repertoire. Books on natural history were a source for illustrations of unfamiliar flowers and fruit, fish, birds and other creatures.","Damask"

"http://data.silknow.org/object/471f15f2-e23c-3a09-a724-bd28d9afeac5","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","This is a chasuble, the vestment worn by a Catholic priest when celebrating the mass. Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. This may account for the beautiful construction of the back and the rather less refined construction of the front. 

On the back, the embroidered orphreys (decorative bands) have been attached to two pieces of red brocaded silk so that the gold camels in the pattern march across the textile horizontally, flanked by flowers and foliage. The most elaborate embroidered motifs are also on the back – the Crucifixion, biblical and saintly figures, and two shields or coats of arms bearing the personal devices of Sir Thomas Erpingham: an eagle rising and the red rose of Lancaster. Erpingham (about 1375–1428) was a close associate of Henry IV and Henry V and a veteran of the Battle of Agincourt (1415). The chasuble may have been for his personal chaplain, or for a church with which he was connected.

The silk was probably made in Italy; the embroidered orphreys were probably made in England which was renowned for high quality needlework of this type (often called 'opus anglicanum', literally 'English work'). The high cost of the materials may explain why the front of the chasuble has been put together from small pieces of the silk. The chasuble has been reduced from its original 'bell' shape cut to suit the more fashionable 'fiddle' shape of a later period (in or after the 17th century). Precious silk and fine embroidery, especially containing metallic threads, were used economically, and were often recycled.","Brocaded"

"http://data.silknow.org/object/471f15f2-e23c-3a09-a724-bd28d9afeac5","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","The chasuble is an example of the richly decorated church vestments commissioned by wealthy donors or patrons for use in the Church. This particular example is typical of the International Gothic style favoured in the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the silk characterised by the exotic motif of gold camels bearing flower baskets. The orphreys, in contrast, come from an English tradition of fine needlework (opus anglicanum), so famed in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries that it was sought by the most powerful rulers and churchmen of Europe. The combination of secular and ecclesiastic imagery is not unusual in vestments, the silk being suitable for both secular and ecclesiastical use, the iconography of the embroidered orphreys being specifically ecclesiastical and the coats of arms secular.

Although the chasuble cannot be identified among the records of the many vestments that Sir Thomas Erpingham gave to Erpingham (Norfolk) and other churches, it may have been made for his personal chaplain or for a church with which he was connected. His taste for Italian silks may have been formed on travels in Italy.","Brocaded"

One of the mantua’s characteristics was a long train, which was sewn as a flat piece of silk and arranged with each wearing. The train was folded up, then folded in and draped over a loop of thread on either side of the waist. In order that the finished side of the silk always show when the mantua was worn, the train was constructed with panels of the right and wrong sides of the fabric sewn together. Pinning up and draping a train successfully was an art and required the help of maids to achieve the perfect effect. 

The mantua was worn over a matching petticoat and the resulting ensemble constituted formal daywear in the 1730s. Also typical for this period is the silk, intricately brocaded in a flowing pattern of large, realistically rendered flowers and leaves.","Brocaded"

It is an example of the most elaborate textiles made for furnishings at that time. They were used to cover walls (serving the same function as wallpaper today), to upholster furniture, and to make into curtains. Catherine II of Russia acquired this design and used it in these ways in an apartment in one of her palaces; she chose a blue background instead of this red one.  

'The Partridges' and other similar designs particularly impressed Lasalle's contemporaries because the designer and maker managed to achieve the exact representation of nature (flowers and birds) in a woven fabric, the pattern being created during the weaving process not applied afterwards. This was a technically complex process which involved many hours of labour in preparing the design, setting up the loom and weaving the silk. As a result such silks were extremely expensive, and only within the means of the elite.","Brocaded"

Until the later 17th century most silks were imported. But a silk-weaving industry developed in England, centred around Spitalfields in London, which grew increasingly successful between 1700 and 1760. Huguenot refugee families, contributing technical and business skills, played an integral part in its development.

Spitalfields weavers produced plain and patterned fabrics. Designs changed season by season, influenced by French fashions but developing a distinctive English style. 

This fabric, woven in Spitalfields, is a brocaded silk, and traces of the original construction show that it was part of a gown. The technique of brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into the pattern of a fabric in specific, sometimes very small areas. It was a more laborious process for the weaver than using patterning wefts running from selvedge to selvedge, but the resulting effect could be much more varied and lively.","Brocaded"

Charlotte was seventeen at the time of her marriage to the King in 1761, which was around the time when the silk was woven. It is a lustring, or lutestring, a lightweight silk with a glossy surface.

In France, the colour green was thought only suitable for young women to wear, but attitudes were different in England.  An English aristocrat, Lady Mary Coke, wrote in a letter home from the French court in 1773 : “I had on a green lutestring, a beautiful colour, which I had bought here; the different ideas in different countries are ridiculous; in England ‘tis a colour one might wear at four score [eighty] : here few people wear it after thirty. The Queen I believe takes me to be much younger than I am, to be sure. She did not mean to say anything impolite, when she told me one must be young to wear that colour.” Lady Mary was aged forty-seven at the time.","Brocaded"

1755–60

The wide-hooped skirts of the mantua were already old fashioned in the 1750s, but women were required to wear this cumbersome style to royal assemblies and balls. It required skill to negotiate doorways and carriages while maintaining a graceful posture.

Court dress was made from the most fashionable and expensive fabrics and trimmings. The silks were displayed to perfection on the mantua petticoat and train. Often woven and embroidered with gold thread, they sparkled in candlelight, with diamonds and expensive lace adding to the effect.

Known as a mantua, the gown consists of a bodice with a train at the back.  A very wide petticoat of matching silk completes the ensemble along with a triangle of silk known as a stomacher, in the centre front.

Although considered stylish daywear in the early 18th century,  the mantua had become very old-fashioned by the 1750s and was worn only for court dress.  Wide hoops were beginning to go out of style, but kept their extreme width at court.  To make up for its conservative cut, court dress was always made from the most fashionable as well as expensive fabrics and trimmings.

This example is made from an ivory silk brocaded in a pattern of stylised flowers and leaves.  The abstract form of the motifs is accentuated by the non-naturalistic colours of the precious metal threads.  Such a design is typical of French silk weavers and the fabric was probably imported.  However it could also have been woven in London, as English weavers copied French designs very closely.","Brocaded"

Along all four sides there is a 2 cm deep border of scrolling stems bearing flowers, fruits and berries. Above this there is a 12 cm deep border of isolated floral or fruit sprigs arranged so that the kerchief can be folded diagonally to reveal different design and colour combinations. Square but designed to be folded and worn as a triangle.

The kerchief could be folded to create three different effects:
1. With a Crown Imperial at the lower corner there is one border of each type on either side.
2. With a pomegranate in the lower corner there are identical borders with deep colours.
3. With the red currants and hyacinth in the lower border there are identical borders with paler colours.

Central Europe, 18th century
This delicate kerchief was acquired by the Museum partly because it is an exceptional example of a technique and quality not previously well-represented in the Collection, but primarily for the complexity of its design.  What appears to be a pretty embroidery is, in fact, a superbly designed example of functional art.
the fine silk has been embroidered with a double-faced or reversible pattern of individual plants and a narrow scrolling border.  There are seven motifs along each side, with a small branch of fruit alternating with a flower.  Two of the larger corner motifs are identical and the four borders form two identical pairs: down the left and along the bottom are single blossoms alternating with fruit, while along the top and down the right are floral sprigs bearing several flowers.
The kerchief would have been folded along a diagonal line to form a trianglar scarf and could be folded to create three different effects:
(i) with a crown imperial at the lower corner and one border of each type;
(ii) with the pomegrante in the lower corner and identical borders of deep colours;
(iii) with the red currrants and wild hyacinth in the lower corner and identical borders in which the predominant colours are light blue and yellow.
Such deliberate versatility is the hallmark of a high quality and expensive dress accessory in any age and culture.

At least eleven of the seventeen fruits and flowers depicted were introduced into Europe from or through the Ottoman Empire.  The plants have been copied from botanical drawings and were not drawn from life - flowers and fruit seldom appear together on the stem. The source of these designs would most probably have been a series of scientific studies published in Central Europe in the middle of the 18th cnetury.  However, the emrboidery technique is not European.  The stitch used is one of the most characteristic Turkish embroidery stitches: in English it is called double darning and in Turkish 'pesent'. Because the needle goes over the same row twice, both sides of the work are identical.
As the fine silk ground is completely transparent, the designer did not intend the kerchief to be folded exactly in half to form a triangle.  If it were, both the border on the top and that underneath would be visible - one directly on top of the other - the lines and the colours would intermingle and become blurred and it would be impossible to see or appreciate the design.  If, instead, the kerchief is folded slightly off centre, it is possible to see two borders in perfect detail, one above the other - doubling the effect of pattern and colour.  A transparent silk ground and the Turkish stitch 'pesent' were deliberately selected in order to create this visually stunning and versatile accessory. [1997]","Tabby (silk weave)"

They used natural and artistic materials and often included hand-embroidered decoration inspired by the countryside and wild or garden flowers.

Additional colour has been brushed over some of the chrysanthemums.
The centres of the hexagons and chrysanthemums are embroidered with gold couched thread and some of the plum flowers are entirely worked in this method. The other plum flowers are worked in satin stitch embroidery in grey-mauve floss silk, and green floss silk is used for rudimentary branches.

Nightcap and coif
About 1610; 1600

Men wore nightcaps when relaxing at home, in contrast to more formal headwear worn for public business during the day. The informal head covering for women was the coif. For the wealthy, these could be highly decorated with expensive metal thread and are of great beauty.

Middle-class and aristocratic women wore elaborately decorated coifs.  It would have been worn by itself indoors, or with a hat on top in public. In Western Europe it was customary for both men and women to cover their heads in public up until the 1960s.

It was made from long rectangular strips of silk net individually embroidered with appliqué floral motifs, which have then been joined together with narrow machine-made braid. The embroidery technique, using tiny pieces of semi-sheer cotton lawn, is called Carrickmacross work, and was first developed in the early nineteenth century.

When Betsy and William’s daughter donated the skirt to the V&A she told us that her grandmother, Betsy’s mother, made it. Whilst the skirt is very beautifully done, the strips of net are of slightly uneven widths and the appliqué work down each strip is not always perfectly centred. The randomness of the pattern and some tiny flaws in its laying-out are also signs that it is not by a professional embroiderer. The variety of floral motifs in the embroidery, including at least nine distinct flowers, is notable. The family story was that the skirt was made before Betsy knew who she would marry, so her mother embroidered English roses, Irish shamrocks and Scottish thistles into it in case Betsy’s husband came from outside Wales.","Muslin"

Sleeves ballooned in shape, and skirts fanned out to emphasise a tiny waist. Hairstyles and headgear became equally exuberant, in contrast to the classical simplicity of the turn of the century. Decoration and trimmings reflected a nostalgia for the costume of the past, seen in stomacher-shaped bodices and 'vandyked' (zig-zag shaped) collars inspired by portraits from the seventeenth century.

This dress may well have been a wedding dress as it is so rich in detail and trimmings. White weddings were becoming widespread as a result of the fashion for muslin dresses.

A cap such as this one, gathered and full to suggest the shape of a turban, was popular for evening wear about 1820.   The Romantic movement created an interest in the dress of non-European countries, particularly North Africa and the Middle East.   Decorative motifs and accessories were borrowed to make current fashions more ‘exotic’.  Although knowledge of the proper proportions and construction of a turban was not available to British milliners, the overall shape was approximated for the most fashionable headwear.","Muslin"

While heavier fabrics in brighter colours appeared in day dress, white remained fashionable for evening.  This particular example may well have been for summer wear.  It would have been worn with an under-dress of silk, possibly in coloured fabric.   The off-the-shoulder neckline and short sleeves were appropriate evening styles.   By the early 1820s, skirts shortened to ankle length and decorative flounces appear at the hem.

Embroidery in white, called whitework, was a popular style of decoration on white muslin.  The wheel motif embroidered in buttonhole stitch, also includes a technique known as cutwork.  The muslin at the centre of each wheel is cut away and the spokes worked in picot bars.","Muslin"

It shows the high standard of French needlework and the sequence of decorating and sewing up these opulent formal garments. A length of cream silk satin has had the outline of a panel drawn onto it, which has then been decorated to shape. When cut out and sewn, it would have formed the left side of the wearer's train. The matching petticoat and bodice of the robe parée would have been embroidered with the same pattern.

The rich labour-intensive work shows 18th century French embroidery at its most complex. The cream satin ground has pink, mauve and green silk appliqué, folded to create the illusion of swagged fabric drapes. Swansdown, coloured metal threads, chenille embroidery, and small beads of padded satin add further detail and texture.

Adolfo Sardiña started out as a milliner in New York in the early 1950s. In 1962, he opened his own salon, designing clothes to accompany his hats. His earliest designs treated each piece as an individual, special item that could be worn separately, or assembled together into a exuberant whole. While the concept was at odds with the principle of co-ordinating, easy-wear separates that distinguished American sportswear design, Adolfo's elaborate clothes proved popular with his wealthy customers. After the 1960s his designs became dramatically simpler and more elegantly restrained.","Satin (fabric)"

In 1955 he won the Coty Fashion award for his designs for Emmé Millinery. In 1962, he opened his own salon and began designing clothes to accompany his hats. He believed that hats should be worn as an accessory rather than a necessity, and carried this over into his clothing designs. His late 1960s fashions treated each piece as an individual and special item by itself, that could be worn together or separately. Although the principle of American sportswear embraces the concept of co-ordinating separates and a relaxed mix-and-match philosophy, the extravagance of Adolfo's designs sat slightly at odds with this philosophy. Even so, his clothes were popular with his wealthy customers.

During the 1960s Adolfo designed cloaks in felt, richly beaded and braided velvet bolero jackets, peasant-looks, and organdy blouses worn under floral overalls, or with extravagant patchwork evening looks (as here). In 1968, he remarked ""Today, one has to dress in bits and pieces—the more the merrier."" By 1969 he described his clothes as being ""for a woman's fun and fantasy moods—I don't think the classic is appealing to people any more.""

In 1970, Adolfo suddenly changed his design approach, abandoning these extravagant designs for knitwear and understatement. He continued designing splendid eveningwear, though practicality was combined with luxury, such as evening sweaters with ballgown skirts, fur-trimmed knits, caftans and evening pyjamas.

Not For Rainy Days

The soft, flat pumps favoured in the western world for the first half of the 19th century were not made for walking. The silk satin uppers and very thin soles limited women to the domestic sphere. The message that these flat shoes conveyed was that the wearer was wealthy enough to lead a largely domestic life and had no need of hard-wearing or comfortable shoes.

It signified a move away from what were considered to be the extravagant excesses of the late eighteenth century towards a simpler, purer style of dress and footwear influenced by classical antiquity.  

By the middle of the nineteenth century slippers or 'sandal shoes' were still widespread although by the 1850s they were worn largely only for formal wear in black or white.  This pair of shoes is a typical example of that style.  The thin leather sole and delicate silk and satin uppers were relatively simple and cheap to produce.  They could then be personalised with rosettes or other decorative embellishments if desired.  These were simply tacked on to a piece of gauze which was then stitched on at the throat over the top of the existing standard bow which was already in place.","Satin (fabric)"

They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Ornamental patchwork bed hangings and quilted bed covers reflected a household's access to a range of fashionable textiles, from colourful imported chintzes to sumptuous silk velvets. Many were bought specially, but householders also recycled textiles from other objects, a common practice given the financial and emotional investment in valuable fabrics.

Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples, and the work is often embellished with appliqué and embroidery.

Quilting is a method of stitching layers of material together. The layers are most commonly divided as follows:

Quilt top: The decorative layer of the quilt. If the top is pieced, it is known as a 'patchwork quilt'. 

Wadding/batting: A layer of cotton, wool, polyester, silk or other material, which adds warmth and dimension to the quilt. 

Reverse: The bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric. 

Hand-quilting is done on a frame using needles called 'betweens'. The stitches are executed with one hand; the other hand is kept underneath the quilt to feel for the needle. Small, uniform stitches (usually a 'running stitch') are taken through the three layers to form a decorative design. This bed cover has been quilted with a technique now known as 'stitch in the ditch': quilting along the seams of the patchwork to enhance the pieced design.

According to the donor, this quilt was made for Bishop's Court, a medieval manor house in Devon once used by the Bishops of Exeter and later purchased by the Earl of Bedford. In 1651, the house was bought by Peter Beavis, son of a wealthy Exeter merchant.

The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. A pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut out. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. A bedcover that has been pieced but not wadded is often referred to as a coverlet.

The complex, double-sided design of this coverlet would have been pieced over paper when it was first created. At some point in the nineteenth century, repairs have been made to some of the more fragile silks and silk velvets. It was probably at this point that whole sheets of newspaper were used as an interlining, adding strength and stability to the original coverlet.  Paper was handmade until the mid-nineteenth century and was both expensive and extremely useful.  Waste-paper was a valuable household commodity and was often kept over a long period.

Although very little was known about this coverlet when it was acquired in 1937, the papers now visible through the damaged silks provide a record of the household's reading habits. Most are taken from newspapers dating from the 1780s to 1840s, and include trial reports and racing calendars from the Leicestershire area.","Satin (fabric)"

"http://data.silknow.org/object/3cdcbd6d-91e7-33f6-94e6-d21698aebfc6","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","Patchwork is a needlework technique where small pieces of cut out fabric shapes are sewn together to produce a decorative design.  The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. A pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples. 

Quilting is a method of stitching layers of material together and usually consists of a decorative top, a middle layer of wadding or batting which adds warmth to the quilt and a bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric.

This is one of the few patchwork quilts of completely plain fabrics in the V&A's collection. The design of the quilt mixes early and late traditions, with a formal, framed centre made of repeating six-point stars and hexagons. The use of plain silk dress fabrics for this patchwork quilt has provided a design of vibrant contrasting colours, with surprising combinations such as bright blue and brown. The colours used provide a perfect display of fashionable British taste in the third quarter of the nineteenth century.

When the quilt was donated to the museum in 1937, it was said to have been worked by the donor's ancestor, Sarah Tomes (1792-1870), at around the time of her marriage in 1813. The brightly coloured silks are typical of those from the third quarter of the nineteenth century, and it may be that Sarah Tomes made the quilt towards the end of her life.","Satin (fabric)"

The International Exhibitions of the 19th century gave manufacturers the opportunity to display their technical skills to the rest of the world, and at the Great Exhibition of 1851 the 31 exhibitors from Lyon confirmed the supreme quality of their silks above those of their competitors in London.

This spectacular length of silk was bought by the South Kensington Museum (later the Victoria and Albert Museum) at the Paris  Exhibition of 1855 for £14.

This pair of black low-heeled shoes with striking bright blue cutwork, embroidery and tiered grosgrain bow is an example of the fashion for colourful footwear.

This pair with its lace 'fenelon' or tiered bow, a feature particular to the 1860s and 1870s,  is especially elaborate.  Two different types of lace have been used for the edging and the bow, and the addition of a gilt buckle set onto velvet provides a further decorative flourish.  It is not clear whether the lace and buckle were added by the manufacturer, the retailer or the owner.  However, although the satin uppers and leather covered heel appear to have been sewn neatly by machine the applied ornament has been hand-stitched rather crudely.  Sewing machines for use with leather only came into use from 1856 and this helps to date the shoes more accurately.","Satin (fabric)"

The blouse is made of thin sky-blue woven silk embroidered with silk, metal thread and pearls, trimmed with needle lace and faced with woven silk. It is straight-cut with added panels at the side which have been pieced at the shoulders. The sleeves are straight set and wide, with a small folded square gusset underarm. Very fine hand-sewn run-and-fell seams. The side seams are slit at the hem for about 15 cm. The front of the blouse has two long vertical openings from neck to waist, which in effect create a separate panel at the centre front. This panel is rounded at the neck and attached at each side to the back of the neck with a small braid button and loop. The centre panel, the hem and the bottom of the sleeves are embroidered with a scrolling floral pattern in a gold thread wound on a silk core, with some red and green chenille thread and seed pearls. The hem and sleeves are scalloped at the edges and finished with gold thread and seed pearls. The neck and both sides of the front slits are finished with needle-woven braid in gold thread and black silk and trimmed with gold needle lace. The inside of the neck, the centre panel and the edges of the front openings are faced with a darker blue silk.

The skirt is made of woven silk embroidered with metal thread, lined with cotton. Coral coloured silk is woven with a white spot and lined with unbleached cotton. It is a very full skirt made from ten loom widths of fabric gathered by a drawstring at the waist. The hem is trimmed with pale blue satin, bias cut, and a braid of black silk, gold thread and gold strip, forming a row of scallops at each side, worked over orange silk padding.","Satin (fabric)"

Women of the Qajar court in early 19th-century Tehran would have worn this combination of short jacket, gauzy open-fronted blouse and voluminous skirt. They would have henna-painted hands and feet, and sometimes even painted bodies. A painting on the wall opposite this case show Qajar women wearing similar clothing.

Layette pincushions like this one were once customary presents to a new mother, and were most popular between about 1770 and 1890. It was best to give them after the baby arrived, as there was a superstitious belief that they could increase the pain felt by the mother during birth: 'For every pin a pain' and 'More pins, more pain' were two of the traditional sayings. And at a time when many problems could arise during childbirth, some felt that it was taking too much for granted to give birth presents before the baby had arrived. 

Layette pincushions were in some ways the equivalent of the birth congratulation cards we now send, as the pins were often arranged to show good wishes, sometimes in verse. Shorter messages such as 'Welcome Sweet Babe' or 'Welcome Little Stranger' (a coy way of referring to an unborn or newborn baby) were more typical. It took considerable skill to form the words and motifs in pins, and mistakes could damage the fabric. On some later examples it is possible to see a way of doing this more easily. The words and decoration were drawn in pencil on the surface of the fabric first, something which would be invisible after the pins were stuck in. And this method was almost foolproof after 1878, because closed pins became available, and the pincushions were almost purely decorative and commemorative.","Satin (fabric)"

In a report to the Children's Employment Commission in 1842, one contributor, Major J G Burns noted that in areas where it was concentrated, such as Luton and Bedford, straw braiding could be an absolute bar to a child getting any education at all, ""because children as young as three can learn the craft, and their parents are hard to convince that paying for their schooling is necessary when they can earn a living instead"".  Young children were in any case preferred by some employers as being not only cheaper to employ, but sometimes easier to teach handwork techniques to since their fingers were more pliant.

The evidence submitted to the Children's Employment Commission was gathered by asking the children and some adults (in some cases those whose children worked in the same place as they did themselves) a standard set of questions; they afterwards signed their name, or made their mark if unable to sign. Many of the children had received some education: typically they could read but either couldn't write, or couldn't write fluently; occasionally (but much more rarely) they could write but not read, which in some cases may have been indicative of undetected problems with eyesight or health.","Satin (fabric)"

According to the inscription, Taglioni performed two Spanish dances, a Herta and a Cachucha, dances more associated with her rival Fanny Elssler.  
The slipper was given to Lady Selina Bidwell, who may have been one of Taglioni's pupils when she was teaching dance in London in the 1870s.
The shoe formed part of the London Archives of the Dance.  The Archives never achieved an independent home and part of the collection was stored with the dance historian Cyril Beaumont, where it became inextricably mixed with his own collection and came to the Museum as part of the Cyril Beaumont Bequest.

Historical significance: Ballet shoes from the mid 19th century are rare and this, associated as it is with Taglioni and the development of pointe work, is an important artefact in the history of ballet shoe construction.  The shoe is unblocked and the darning under the toe and up the sides would have been the only extra support for pointe work at this period.","Satin (fabric)"

Ikat is a type of weaving where the threads are tie-dyed before weaving to create designs on the finished fabric.

After wrapping, the threads are dyed, however, the areas under the ties will remain the original colour. Numerous colours can be added after additional wrappings. When the dying process is complete, the warp threads are meticulously arranged on the loom to prepare the design.

1840–70

The flock of cranes decorating this gift cover (fukusa) conveys wishes for long life and happiness. The lavish design suggests a wealthy donor. It is executed almost totally in gold-wrapped thread, which is attached to the surface of the fabric with barely visible red stitches. The wings of the birds are padded to enhance the three-dimensional effect. The embroidery looks particularly striking against the dark blue satin ground. [68]

Watts Gift

The flock of cranes decorating this <i>fukusa</i> convey wishes for long life and happiness. Cranes were believed to live for a thousand years and to inhabit Mount Horai, the land of the immortals. They are one of the most common motifs in Japanese art. This <i>fukusa</i> would have been appropriate for celebrations of birthdays and weddings.

The design is executed almost totally with gold wrapped thread which is couched down with stitches that are virtually invisible to the naked eye. The wings of the birds are also padded. The embroidery looks particularly striking against the indigo blue background, which became a popular choice for <i>fukusa</i> from about 1850.

This <i>fukusa</i> was presented to an Englishman, William Rogers, at the Emperor's Palace in Japan in 1874. His sister gave it to the Museum in 1923. [December 1993]","Satin (fabric)"

This <i>fukusa</i>has no lining. The cranes in the lower half are turning right and those on the upper half are turning left. This <i>fukusa</i>was donated by Mrs. Walts, whose brother, William Roger, was presented with it in 1874 at the ""Mikado's Palace"" in Japan.

In Japan since the early Heian period, 794-1184, cranes have been regarded as birds of longevity. This belief had it origin in China. In the Chinese Taoist book <i>Huainanzi</i> (<i>Enangi</i> in Japanese) written in the 2nd century BC, there is mention of ""a thousand year old crane."" The Chinese admired the crane for it beauty and regarded it as the companion of a legendary wizard. It later came to imply longevity. In Japan the crane is also loved for its elegant posture and its clear cry. In the <i>Manyoshu</i>, a collection of poems from 7th to 8th century, this cry is expressed as the ""one cry of a crane,"" meaning the final voice of authority. The idea that the crane combines aspects of  purity and naivete in its elegant features is derived from Taoist thought. There is a Japanese proverb, ""the crane lives thousand years, and the turtle lives ten thousand years."" The crane actually lives for about 80 years and therefore was considered to have a long life, especially when people had an average life span of 50 years. Since the crane continues to live in one place from generation to generation, it further promotes the idea of living for a long time. Hence, the crane and the turtle have become a highly revered symbol of longevity along with the <i>sho chiku bai</i>, pine, bamboo and plum. These patterns are commonly found not only on <i>fukusa</i> but also on art work and craft objects. The crane, as well as the turtle, is also associated with the sunrise, Mt. Fuji, <i>sho chiku bai</i>, auspicious clouds, the ocean, waves, the character of <i>kotobuki</i> etc., in order to express a sense of purity and longevity on a happy occasion. The crane is also a symbol of conjugal harmony as implied by its dance at  breeding time and two cranes together express conjugal bliss. At this time, according to legend, one has an open beak while the other has a closed beak, as an expression of a'un. (See p. 270)

Often the crane is shown in flight with a strip of paper attached to its leg. This motif is based on the legend of Minamoto Yoshitomo (1123-60?), and his son, Yoritomo who put gold plates on crane's legs when they flew from Yuigahama beach. The cranes flew back to Tazawa in Shizuoka prefecture hundreds of years later. In another story the lord of the Ii family in Hikone captured the cranes. This motif or design symbolises the long life of the crane.

This <i>fukusa</i> with a flock of flying cranes is a good omen, many <i>kotobuki</i>, or a hundred <i>kotobuki</i>, which is appropriate for any celebration.

There are areas of raised work and applied pearls. The edge of the lid is embroidered with a small geometric pattern in laid floss silks.

The upper body is covered with four sloping panels embroidered with animals taken from pattern books (the lion and unicorn, hare and hound, leopard and camel, and elephant and deer) above a row of squares worked with laid floss silks in geometric patterns with flowers and birds. The initials 'ME' are applied in pearls at the centre of the sloping front.
The front and sides of the lower body are embroidered with the seven virtues - Faith, Hope and Charity, Justice and Temperance, and Fortitude and Prudence. The back has a squirrel between two birds.

The stitches used include satin, back, rococo and tent stitch.

The inside of the lid is lined with padded pink silk. When open, it reveals a tray lined with a section of a print showing the story of David and Goliath, and with mirrors lining the edges and small plaster pillars. The tray lifts out to expose a compartment lined with marbled paper underneath it.

Except for the wax Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer (Washington: NGA) none of these sculptures had been publicly exhibited during the artist’s lifetime.Although Degas had not favored reproducing his sculptures in more permanent materials, his heirs authorized that copies be cast in bronze in order to preserve the compositions and to sell them as finished works. Paul-Albert Bartholomé, a sculptor and Degas's longtime friend, prepared 72 of the figures for casting, a process executed by the distinguished Paris foundry A.-A. Hébrard et Cie. The quality of the Degas bronzes was tightly controlled and their edition was limited. Only twenty-two editions of the series of 72 figures were cast. Each bronze within the series was assigned a number from one to seventy-two. The first twenty editions were assigned a letter from A-T. In most cases these numbers and letters were incised on the individual bronzes.The series of 72 bronzes was completed before May 1921 when it was exhibited in Paris. Edition A, comprising the first and best casts of the series, was reserved for the important Impressionist collector Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer. She later acquired the first bronze cast of the Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer (lettered A, but not numbered), which had been omitted from the initial series. In 1929 Mrs. Havemeyer bequeathed Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer and 70 of the 72 Edition A Degas bronzes to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.A short video regarding the recreation of the tutu is here.","Satin (fabric)"

"http://data.silknow.org/object/2396a9e8-a19e-3581-bb13-acef93530a81","http://data.silknow.org/graph/met","On 31 October 1947 Duveen Brothers sold what the firm called ""The Marie Antoinette Set"" for 180,000 dollars to Samuel H. Kress (1863-1955). [1] It consisted of three embroidered wall hangings and various pieces of matched seat furniture that originally belonged to two different eighteenth-century suites, with the addition of several later pieces. [2] The wall hangings-chain-stitched embroideries in silk on a white silk-satin ground-show musical instruments, birds' nests, baskets of flowers, and sun hats linked together with swags of flowers. The present armchair and an identical example, as well as a pair of side chairs of the same design, have eighteenth-century show covers that were made to match these embroideries. In order to give the group of seat furniture a unified appearance, the remaining pieces were upholstered with portions cut from additional embroidered hangings that were sacrificed for this purpose.It is not entirely clear how such an illustrious provenance became attached to this assembled lot. When the settee, which dates to the nineteenth century, was published in 1927, nothing was said about its origin except, erroneously, that the eighteenth-century menuisier Georges Jacob had signed it. [3 In 1934, however, the author of a book on French furniture stated that the set had been made by Jacob for Marie Antoinette (1755-1793), and described it as ""one of the most beautiful examples of the talent of this master."" [4] Furthermore, he declared that the embroidery was the work of the queen and her ladies and that Marie Antoinette gave the entire set to Louis-Jean-Marie de Bourbon, duc de Penthièvre (1725-1793). [5]Stamped by Georges Jacob, who supplied much furniture to the court of Louis XVI (1754-1793), this armchair and its pair have straight, rectangular backs, which characterize them as fauteuils à la reine. When cutting the walnut frames, Jacob must have carefully taken into consideration the planned decoration, leaving enough wood to allow the unidentified but obviously very skilled carver to execute the designs. Particularly striking are the deeply undercut garlands of myrtle branches spiraling around a straight rod on the seat and back rails. Trails of berried myrtle branches are carved around the tapering shafts of the cylindrical legs, which are crowned by collars of laurel leaves and berries. Laurel leaves are also repeated on the front of the curving arm supports that terminate in acanthus-leaf volutes. A molding of pearls and twisted-rope motifs carved along the top of the seat rail gives a rhythmical effect not unlike that created by brass upholstery nails-here absent because the chairs are covered à châssis. The original slip seat and webbing have been preserved. The back panel, edge roll, arm pads, and comfortable down and feather seat cushion are all covered in the original late-eighteenth-century embroidered silk-satin. [6] The back displays floral branches framed by scrolling floral borders. The seat cushion shows a basket of flowers within similar borders. Certain motifs, such as the band of pearls along the fore edge of the seat as well as along the borders of the cushion and of the back, clearly relate to the carving of the wooden frame. The high quality of the once very colorful chain-stitched embroidery clearly identifies it as professional work rather than as the fruit of the queen's pastime. The elegant floral compositions are close to designs by the famed silk manufacturer Philippe de Lasalle (1723-1804/5).From a series of marks, inscriptions, and inventory numbers on the frames of both armchairs a considerable amount of information can be gleaned. [7] First of all, the incised roman numerals VII and VIII indicate that they were numbers seven and eight of a suite that included both arm- and side chairs, and possibly one or more settees. It was not unusual for a chairmaker to identify the various elements, especially such removable parts as slip seats and arm pads, as belonging to a certain chair, to avoid mixing them up.The French inscription ""de P[enthiè]vre Paris Chambre à Balus[tre]"" (and a variation of this) is enlightening as well, showing that the chairs were in the possession of the wealthy duc de Penthièvre, grand admiral of France and a cousin of Louis XVI. The set furnished his Paris residence, the Hôtel de Toulouse, an early-seventeenth-century building on the rue de la Vrillière, near the place des Victoires. By 1719 the architect Robert de Cotte (1656-1735) had renovated the mansion for the duc de Penthièvre's father, the comte de Toulouse.[8] The hôtel had, according to a late-eighteenth-century description, a chambre des balustres, or room with balustrade on the ground floor. [9] Used only on special occasions, this room was a chambre de parade, or ceremonial bedchamber. A curving balustrade, or estrade, seen in a plan by Jacques-François Blondel (1705-1774), closed off a bed alcove separating the state bed from the rest of the room . [10] To have such a balustrade was a privilege, allowed only in the state apartments of dukes, princes, and grands seigneurs. [11] The formal nature of the Museum's armchairs as so-called fauteuils meublants, placed along the wall and considered to be part of the interior decoration, reflects the official function of the room. Given the various other French inscriptions on the frames, it is possible that the chairs were also used in a different part of the house. It has been suggested that the entire set was placed in the first-floor apartment of the duke's widowed daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse-Louise, princesse de Lamballe (1749-1792), a friend of Marie Antoinette's. [12]After the duc de Penthièvre's death his only surviving daughter, Louise-Marie-Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre (1753-1821), inherited his possessions. Married to the liberal Louis-Philippe-Joseph, duc d'Orléans (1747-1793), who renounced his title and became known as Philippe-Égalité, she was widowed when he was guillotined during the Reign of Terror in 1793. She was exiled from France, and her property including the Hôtel de Penthièvre (Toulouse) was confiscated in 1797. The chairs may then have come into the possession of the banker Gabriel-Julien Ouvrard (1770-1846), whose name is written on stickers affixed to the slip seats. Having amassed a huge fortune in war speculations, Ouvrard became purveyor to the French navy in 1798. He apparently acquired several of the confiscated estates of the Orléans family that were, however, returned to them in 1814. The ""B125"" marks on the chairs probably refer to one of these properties, perhaps the eighteenth-century Château de Bizy, in Normandy, where the duc de Penthièvre died and his daughter lived after her return from exile. An inventory of the Château de Bizy described the Salon de Famille as furnished with hangings of white silk-satin embroidered with floral designs, and it listed a large set of seat furniture in the same room that was upholstered to match. This inventory was drawn up shortly after 1830, when the castle was in the possession of the son of Philippe-Égalité, Louis-Philippe (1773-1850), duc d'Orléans, who became king of France in 1830.The crowned, interlaced monogram ""LPO"" on the chairs clearly refers to his ownership, and he may have been responsible for uniting the two sets. It has been said that Louis-Philippe left the assembled seat furniture to his youngest daughter, Marie-Clémentine (1817-1907), who lived in Austria after her marriage to Prince Augustus of Saxe-Coburg. [13] Some years after her death, in September 1913, Duveen Brothers, the well-known antiques dealership with branches in London, Paris, and New York, acquired this set of furniture. [14]Notes:1 Duveen Brothers Records 1876-1981, Papers and Correspondence, 1901-81, box 475, f. 5 (microfilm, reel 330).2. In 1958 the pieces were a gift of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation to the Museum. They included two armchairs (acc. nos. 58.75.25,26) and two matching side chairs (58.75.33,34) all stamped by Georges Jacob. There were also two similar armchairs (58.75.30,31) and one small settee, or marquise (58.75.27), also by Jacob but part of another set. In addition, there were a settee (58.75.24), two armchairs (58.75.29,32), and a second marquise (58.75.28) executed at a later date to match the design of accession numbers 58.75.27,30,31. The wall hangings have the accession numbers 58.75.35-37. See Dauterman, Parker, and Standen 1964, pp. 61-75, nos. 7-9.3. Feulner 1927, p. 675, fig. 600.

Inscribed in ink on a sticker pasted under the back seat rail is ""Chambre à Coucher."" Incised on the top of each seat rail under the slip seat is the roman numeral VII. Painted on the back rail of the slip seat is ""No 7 Chambre . . . Balustre en haut,"" and pasted there is a sticker on which is written in ink ""Ouvrard.""

The gauntlets of these gloves are embroidered with motifs which also appear on other objects made in the late Elizabethan era—a disembodied eye raining pale blue and silver tears, a colorful pansy flower, and a bright green parrot with pearls on its wings. The weeping eye is related to a contemporary emblem book, Henry Peacham's Minerva Britanna, or A Garden of Heroical Devises of 1612, though this motif was known as a symbol of unrequited love well before the publication of Peacham's book.The pansy, watered by the tears of the weeping eye, was a popular flower in the Elizabethan era. It was known to be a favorite of the queen herself and the pansy continued to appear in embroidery well into the seventeenth century.Despite the present fragile and somewhat degraded condition of these gloves, they retain enough of their sumptuous embroidery to convey the luxury of the highest quality needlework of the late Tudor and early Stuart era.","Satin (fabric)"

The technique was used to create pictures and to decorate objects such as storage boxes for jewelry and writing supplies, baskets, and mirror frames. This box is typical of raised-work pieces in that it employs a variety of stitches and includes the use of metal thread and other materials, in addition to colored silks. The faces of the five women representing the Senses are drawn in ink on satin, and the figure of Sight holds a mirror made of mica that reflects her face. Other unexpected materials were frequently used to highlight details: real hair for a figure's head, tiny seed pearls for a necklace, and glass beads for animal eyes.Allegorical and biblical subjects, along with portraits of monarchs, were the most common themes for the decoration of a seventeenth-century box. Of the seven complete and partial boxes in the Museum's collection, the majority show biblical scenes, although these are sometimes combined with depictions of the Senses or the Seasons.Raised work had a rather short period of popularity and was at its peak during the mid-seventeenth century. The creation of raised-work boxes, mirror frames, and pictures ceased to be a fashionable occupation by the turn of the eighteenth century, if not sooner.","Satin (fabric)"

Embroidered caskets were made in the 17th century and used by girls from well-off families to store personal possessions. They often have secret drawers built into them, allowing girls to hide their keepsakes. Due to the cost of the materials, and the significant amount of time required to make an embroidered casket, they became prized possessions. As a result a significant number have survived in good condition. 

<b>Materials & Making</b>
The panels for embroidered caskets were generally worked by young girls, around aged 11, as part of their education. Young girls in the 17th century would be taught needlework skills from a young age, starting with creating a sampler, then moving on the whitework and cutwork, and then finally creating a casket. The panels would then be sent off to be made up into a casket.","Satin (fabric)"

<b>Decoration</b>
Satin ground worked in coloured silk and metal thread, also decorated with bobbin lace, edged with metallic braid.

Each panel of the casket depicts a different scene, the top is Abraham and the Sacrifice of Issac. The casket is decorated all over with various flowers, animals and insects, some in raised work, typical of this work.
The interior is lined with peach-pink fabric. There are two lock plates in gold. 

<b>Construction</b>
Casket, comprised on three main sections. First section: Opened by lifting up the lid to reveal a small compartment for writing materials including letter slots, an ink pot and a sand pot. 
Second section: accessed by lifting up the top section, which hinges open to reveal a compartment. The lid holds a mirror. The tray is subdivided into multiple sections, one of which is a recessed compartment, the walls of which are set with small mirrors, and the base is decorated with a coloured print.

However, she trimmed her hat with wax orange-blossom, which was worn by brides for their first marriage.

The availability of sewing machines, commercially printed dress patterns and affordable but good-quality machine-woven silks and trimmings enabled skilled needlewomen to make sophisticated gowns at home like this dress. As a lady's maid, Harriett had excellent sewing skills, enabling her to finish her dress to a very high standard. A coloured day dress that could be worn for best after the ceremony was an extremely practical option for brides of limited means. Soon after the wedding, Harriett slightly altered the skirt, removing two side panels to create a narrower, more fashionable silhouette. She also added purple silk braid to the skirt-front so it could be worn separately with a blouse.","Satin (fabric)"

Caskets were made and used by girls in the 17th century. The girls would decorate small panels with embroidery which would then be sent to a cabinet-maker to be made up into a casket. They were often fitted with compartments for sewing and writing as well as a small mirror. Many cabinets also had secret compartments, used to store personal possessions such as jewellery or letters. The high cost of the materials, as well as the skill needed to create these caskets, means they could only have been made in wealthy households.

<b>People</b>
The panels were worked by young girls, aged around 11 or 12, as part of their education. Girls started learning needlework skills aged 6 or 7, first creating a band sampler (see T.433-1990) and then moving on to more complex pieces such as cutwork. Embroidering the panels of a casket or for a mirror (see T.17-1955) appears to have been one of the last stage of a girl’s needlework education. These skills would be useful later in life in the management of a household.

<b>Materials &amp; Designs</b>
Biblical, mythological and classical scenes were all popular themes for decorating caskets. While some girls may have designs their own panels, taking inspiration from sources such as illustrated bibles, it also appears to have been possible to have purchased designs, which the embroiderer could then customise by using certain colours or adding in features. This casket is the largest in the V&A's collection.","Satin (fabric)"

Some of the objects clearly do not match the casket’s seventeenth-century date. Thread, both dyed silk and metal varieties, was purchased by weight, and the number of objects devoted to the organization of threads speaks to the value of this material. Decorated boxes intended to store sewing implements, among other things, were known on the Continent as well as in England; several seventeenth-century Dutch cushion-shaped containers survive, and seventeenth-century genre paintings confirm their practical use as supports for sewing.The completion of a decorated casket or cabinet would have been considered the culmination of a young woman’s education in needlework skills, and a few boxes have survived that can be firmly attributed to schoolgirls. Martha Edlin’s dated embroidered objects form the most complete record we have of one person’s output in the seventeenth century (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), although professional contributions at any point in the work would certainly have been possible. The exuberance of the decoration and the rather indiscriminate combination of materials and techniques suggest that this casket is the work of an amateur. Contrast this with the cabinet illustrating scenes from the Life of Joseph (MMA, 39.13.3a-k), which was executed in a single technique (laid and couched silk) and precisely and evenly worked on all faces of the box. This casket also lacks the consistency of theme present on most cabinets; the top of the lid shows the meeting of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, whereas the side panels are apparently random combinations of motifs typical of the period: heraldic animals, a castle, and a fountain, all surrounded by oversized flora and fauna. It is possible that the embroidered panels of this casket may have been applied to the wood carcass at a date significantly later than the execution of the decoration. The carcass itself is too large for the embroidered panels; the gaps where the satin foundation fabric does not cover the wood are patched with more silk and disguised with metal bobbin lace. The color and style of the lining—green silk with a padded main compartment—differ from most other boxes of the seventeenth century as well. Another casket in the Lady Lever Art Gallery collection has a similar padded interior, but the silk lining is described as the typical salmon-pink color.Nevertheless, this casket is important for its possible association with a mirror in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection (MMA, 39.13.2a). The back of the mirror frame is marked with the initials A.P. and the date 1672, and the casket contains thread holders or winders and a metal bodkin marked with the same initials. Both of these objects were in the collection of Percival Griffiths, and early scholars assumed that they were the work of the same maker. Although the mirror frame displays a more skilled and certain command of techniques and materials, it does contain some unusual elements, such as actual shells used in the decoration of the grotto. G. Saville Seligman and Talbot Hughes mentioned ""Lady Ann Paulet, who was a very accomplished broiderer"" in association with these embroideries, possibly referring to a lady-in-waiting to Queen Mary II (1662–1694), but no other evidence exists to support this attribution. The uncertain date of the construction of the casket, along with the survival of various tools and accessories, speaks to the continued significance of embroidery in the lives of women beyond the seventeenth century.[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Satin (fabric)"

The body of the garment is a Portuguese white silk of the late seventeenth—early eighteenth century brocaded with polychrome silk and chenille yarns. The bright white satin ground of the center panels at front and back are embroidered with silk and silver threads; the materials of this center panel, including the satin ground fabric, are likely from Asia.¹ Narrow metallic woven bands, or galloons, outline the panels and neckline.²A variety of images—including fanciful fountains, unicorns amid cypress trees, spotted leopards, peacocks with tails in full display, and several figures including Hercules and the haloed Christ Child—have been scattered by the weaver throughout the largely secular brocade of the side panels.³ In contrast, the subject matter of the embroidered center panels is entirely Christian. On the front panel are the embroidered initials IHS, the Latin anagram for Jesus Christ used by the Jesuits, while the back panel bears a superimposed A and M for ""Ave Maria"" (or Hail Mary), the archangel Gabriel’s salutation to the Virgin as reported in Luke 1:28. Above the two letters is a crown, and the entire image is surrounded by lilies. An embroidered inscription, qui pascitu inter lilia, a phrase from the Song of Songs (6:3) that translates as ""He who feedeth among the lilies,"" surrounds a silver Paschal Lamb (representing the Lamb of God). Other Christian symbols in the panels include the Pelican in Her Piety, a flowering rose, and a silver pomegranate. The many references to the Virgin in the imagery suggest that this chasuble was used in a convent or in a Jesuit church dedicated to Marian devotion.⁴This elaborate embroidery, with its variety of silk and metallic threads, shares traits and materials from both Portugal and Asia. The multicolor bands that represent the pelican, for example, are typical of Philippine embroidery (detail), yet the bright yellow dye is weld, a European dyestuff.⁵ The flatness of the needlework and its limited palette, as well as the detailed rendering of the individual feathers at the tips of the birds’ wings, are features that may be more Asian than European. A Peruvian example, based on an Asian model, also depicts bird feathers in this way.⁶  It may be that the embroidery took place in Portugal, with artisans also following the Asian model, using a composite of Asian and Portuguese materials. [Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1. The brocade, a five-harness silk on a white satin ground with weft float patterning, includes a number of different colors and types of yarns. Some are unspun silk, others are plied two-color (black and white), and still others are chenille yarns with a pile. The two center panels are a white satin seven-harness ground fabric with warp and weft yarns bearing no twist, which likely was imported from China. The embroidery for the silk is satin stitch, with couching stitches to hold the metallic yarns that outline the designs. The embroidery is sparse, revealing the white background throughout. 2. The tape is composed of weft-faced plain weave with silk warp and silk wrapped with metal-sheet weft. 3. This imagery is related to that in a more narrative panel with a large fountain as its central motif (Metropolitan Museum, acc. no. 35.30). Adele Weibel has identified this type of fabric as either Portuguese or from Extremadura in Spain and believes that a group of related textiles with fountains and chenille threads were produced by the same (unknown) master weaver; see Weibel, Two Thousand Years of Textiles, pp. 151—52, nos. 272 and 276.

The top two-thirds of the sampler includes motifs easily classifiable into standard categories, such as alphabetic characters, geometric designs, and floral motifs, worked in silk and linen on a linen ground using several common stitch techniques. An embroidered alphabet marks the end of the top third of the piece. The middle third is worked with white thread on a white ground, a technique commonly known as whitework. This middle section features scattered design motifs and concludes with an embroidered rendering of the maker’s name and dates of production.The bottom third of the piece is worked in reticella, a technique that originated in the late fifteenth century. The technique developed from cutwork and utilized stitches common to embroidery. Threads were pulled from a plain weave linen fabric to create open spaces in which a design was completed and the deconstructed fabric was stabilized primarily with buttonhole stitches. The result is a design based on the grid of the foundation fabric, with open areas throughout and arched and scalloped borders. Subsequently, the technique progressed to the point where the foundation fabric was eliminated and the design was worked over threads temporarily secured to a piece of vellum or paper for stability during the construction of what was called punto in aria (literally, ""stitches in air""), or early needle lace.Designs for reticella were popularized through numerous editions of late sixteenth-century Continental pattern books. Copies of these books made their way into England, and their popularity occasioned the publication of English pattern books, mostly consisting of patterns copied from the earlier book.Although cutwork and needle-lace techniques continued to be popular, especially for fashionable accessories, through the 1630s, there are very few examples of these techniques that have been attributed to English manufacture, despite the number of English samplers that confirm these skills were taught. The finest lace was imported, although the cost was certainly prohibitive for all but the elite. Therefore, the cultivation of practical skill in whitework and lace techniques would enable the maker to produce all manner of trimming necessary to fashionable attire. This sampler was purchased by London’s Royal School of Needlework in 1916; and it is quite possible that it continued to fulfill its seventeenth-century function of being an exemplar for early twentieth-century students.Samplers containing whitework, cutwork, and needle lace were attempted after basic skills were already mastered, if the case of Martha Edlin can be considered typical. She created her polychrome band sampler first and then move on to the more challenging whitework and cutwork embroidery. Women’s training in this standard progression of technical skills was an extraordinarily important part of a seventeenth-century education, particularly for daughters of the upper class and gentry. According to the household accounts of the Verney family, at least two hours each day were set aside for the practice of embroidery under the instruction of a tutor. It was decided that Sir Ralph Verney’s eight-year-old daughter, ""being a girl she shall not learn Latin, so she will have more time to learn breeding [manners] hereafter and needlework too."" Training in embroidery not only prepared a girl in practical necessities, but it also held a moral dimension. Richard Braithwaite in his 1631 text The English Gentlewoman noted that textile production should be considered ""arguments of [her] industry, memorials of [her] piety."" Women were educated in preparation for marriage, to run a household, and to be a good Christian. Verses from the Bible were often read aloud as women performed household sewing and embroidery, instilling the very activity of working with a needle with pious associations.The use of all three embroidery types—colored, whitework, and lace techniques—on a band sampler is relatively rare compared with simpler combinations of colored bands and whitework. As previously noted, it is uncertain how much actual needle-lace trimming was produced in England during the mid-seventeenth century, but there is a relatively large number of surviving whitework samplers dated to the 1640s. Particularly notable are examples that include figural compositions with detached elements.[Emily Zilber, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Satin (fabric)"

Slomann’s theory that these woven silks were designed, and is some cases produced, in India was quickly refuted, but the term has stuck.¹ The precise origin for this distinctive style of silk produced in Europe between about 1690 and 1720 has not been established; a number of cultures clearly contributed to the creation of these patterns. Certain relationships have been drawn: for example, an integration of Japanese design concepts such as the abstraction of motifs and a discrepancy of scale has been suggested as a primary influence.² In this panel the influence of Ottoman sixteenth- and seventeenth-century design is apparent in the meandering pattern and the layering of motifs, as well as in their large scale. Like many European bizarre silks, the motifs in this panel have become so stylized that they defy identification. The high quality of this particular example and others of the type suggests that these textiles were made in well-established European weaving centers, such as Lyon or Tours in France, in Venice, or in other Italian or Spanish textile-producing cities. A small number of them have been associated with the Spitalfields weaving center (now in the East End of London) on the basis of the extant design drawings by several early eighteenth-century English designers.³ The Dutch are known to have had a significant silk-weaving industry as well (see MMA 1976.12), and some Dutch examples of bizarre silk from the early eighteenth century have been identified.⁴ There are few complete garments surviving from the turn of the eighteenth century, but a rare unaltered bizarre silk mantua is at the Metropolitan Museum (see MMA 1991.6.1a,b). Mantuas of this period were relatively unstructured women’s gowns that took most of their shape from draping and pinning on the body. The expanse of fabric from the shoulder to the train created an ideal showcase for such luxurious textiles with large patterns.Very few bizarre silks seem to have been used for interior decoration, though vegetal motifs similar to those seen on the dress silks found their way to embroidered furnishings (see MMA 53.32.1a-d and 53.32.2a-d). 1.

As today, they had practical functions: they were used for protection or warmth, and, in some cases, perfumed gloves were used for medical purposes. Yet they were also potent extensions of social actions; they were symbols of status and obligation, thrown down in challenge or treasured as tokens of affection. In this way, gloves were a conspicuous pleasure—in paintings, they are frequently held rather than worn. This pair features preening birds of paradise, carnations, roses, and tiny borages—possibly inspired by those in La Clef des Champs (1586) and A schole-house, for the needle (1632)—and set within arabesques. The tabbed, gauntlet-style was popular for displaying elaborate, expensive professional embroidery, as the tabs are slightly gusseted to fit over the wearer’s intricate lace cuffs.

The valance depicts scenes from courtly life, but the precise narrative has not been identified. Yvonne Hackenbroch titled this piece ""The Education of Princess Elizabeth I"" mainly because of the young child with the man in classical garb, said to be a depiction of Elizabeth I’s tutor, Roger Ascham, but there is no other iconography to support this reading. The embroidery could simply illustrate the daily activities of ladies at court, although the interaction of the various figures implies the existence of a specific sequence of events.One possible iconographical reading lies in the identification of contemporary female personifications of the Five Senses. Reading from left to right, the woman gazing into the mirror may personify Sight; the woman with a falcon gesturing toward the young girl may personify Touch; the woman in profile in front of the fountain may represent Smell as she bends toward a potted flower; and the women playing musical instruments would represent Hearing. However, there is no obvious personification of the sense of taste. Additionally, the older man ushering a young girl toward the woman with the falcon, the presence of the jester, and the woman on horseback suggest that a specific narrative is intended.The valance can be compared to other valances and panels with unidentified narratives; similar scenes with equally opaque narratives involving costumed figures and garden settings, for example, are on two valances in the Musée de la Renaissance, Château d’Écouen, documented by Maria-Anne Privat-Savigny in 2003. These hunting and court scenes are interspersed with dramatically posed figures, such as a woman begging on her knees and two decapitations. Other valances and decorative panels of tent stitch illustrate biblical or mythological tales and, more rarely, historical events.Valances of this type have generally been dated to the late sixteenth century, based in part on the attire of the figures and the woven textile patterns that correspond to those found in extant textiles from the period. The clothing closely relates to costume prints from such books as Cesare Vecellio’s Habiti Antichi e Moderni di Diversi Parti del Mondo (1590) and Pierre Bertelli’s Habits des Diverses Nations (1594); these depictions (the first fashion plates) of the dress of various classes and cultures appear to have circulated widely throughout Europe. The use of tent stitch on canvas appeared in England by the middle of the sixteenth century, although it was practiced earlier in France. Santina Levey credits this technique’s introduction to English furnishing textiles to the influence of the French court. It is difficult, therefore, to attribute definitively many of these designs to one place of manufacture, when they were clearly produced in France, Scotland, and England, based on many of the same sources.This panel was most likely one of a set of bed valances intended to decorate the edges of a tester that hung over a bed in order to cover the attachment points of the bed curtains. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the bed was one of the most important pieces of furniture in the household. The finest sets of hangings would have included embroidered inner and outer valances, curtains, a tester, and a counterpane, in addition to embroidered pillows. Embroidered valances were also used to decorate the tops of walls, typically over a wall surface covered in textiles.[Elyse Gerstenecker, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Satin (fabric)"

Small elements—fruits, flowers, and leaves—were worked in tent stitch on canvas and then applied to the dark velvet foundation on which was worked the river in the Garden of Eden, the figures of Adam and Eve, and God the Father, in polychrome silk and metal threads. The garden is monumental, almost overwhelming the figures. The three trees that anchor the composition would have brought to mind the biblical description of trees in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. The scene of Adam and Eve being expelled from Eden on the far right may also derive from a reading of contemporary vernacular English Bibles, rather than any pictorial convention. Adam and Eve wear garments that suggest articles of late Elizabethan dress and the Geneva Bible of 1560 referred to their first clothes as ""breeches.""

The composition of the cover and matching back is dominated by a central royal blazon of the Stuart monarchy quartered with the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The arms are surmounted by the royal crown and supported by a lion and unicorn engaging the shield with the Order of the Garter with its motto: ""Honi Soit Qvi Mal Y Pense"" in silver filé. The royal arms are surrounded by a voluted cartouche accentuated by fronds of tightly packed silver purl, couched down closely onto the green satin ground and headed by a scroll with the inscription ""Gloria Deo."" Flanking this central cartouche are two unidentified badges bearing a crossed silver key and what appears to be a staff, each within a wreath of satin-stitch laurel leaves and silver bells. Beneath and above these is a finely worked voluted interlace of couched silver cording, from which all the foliage, flowers, and heavily fruit-laden festoons hang in thick profusion.The front cover’s degraded condition helps to identify the array of techniques. A surviving coil of couched silver purls on the lower right volute beneath the royal arms suggests that the entire interlace was once filled with such couched silver purls. This is confirmed by the remnants of stitch holes that once held them to the satin surface. In addition, some missing leaves on the festoon reveal how several detached buttonhole leaves were raised by small tufts of wool felt, still present in the spaces of the festoon’s missing leaves. The various fruits are made vivid by a mixture of pink, blue, red, and yellow silk threads blended expertly in long-and-short-stitch silk thread over padding that follows closely the shape of the gourds, apples or peaches, and pomegranates. The grapes are rendered in a variety of stitches, including couched silver purl in the form of grape clusters loosely stitched over with yellow and pink silk floss. The effect is a silvery pink-yellow variegation that mimics the frosty skin of actual grapes. Ink marks of the original design are still visible in places.The royal coat of arms had been associated with the English Bible since the break with Rome in 1534, when Henry VIII proclaimed himself the ""Supreme Head on Earth"" of the Church of England. Thereafter, the royal coat of arms became emblematic not just of the king’s temporal authority, but his spiritual authority as well. The Tudor, and later the Stuart arms, would be emblazoned over the printed Bible and other investitures of ceremony of the English church, examples of which can be found in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The cover encloses three books bound together: the Geneva version of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer, printed in 1612 and 1616, respectively, by the London printer Robert Barker, as well as a Book of Psalms, printed by the Company of Stationers in London in 1624, a date that provides a terminus post quem for the binding. As David McKitterick notes, it was not uncommon for such works to be bound together in the seventeenth century, even texts of varied dates such as these. The richness of the cover suggests a ceremonial use. The prominent imprese on the cover, possibly relating to insignias of office, may also imply a more official usage. Yvonne Hackenbroch reported a ""tradition"" (though without supporting documentation) that this volume had been a gift from King James I to Sir Edward Denny, later 1st Earl of Norwich. Although in 1870 Isaac d’Israeli recorded an 18th-century report of a gift of gloves from King James I to Denny, this provenance cannot be confirmed from the imprese, which show no likeness to Edward Denny’s coat of arms and have yet to be identified. It may also be reasonably supposed that James would confer as gifts copies of his own Authorized Version of the Bible, in print since 1611, rather than the older Geneva version, as here. A surviving Master’s Crown of the Broderer’s Company, dated to the second half of the sixteenth century and illustrated in George Wingfield-Digby’s Elizabethan Embroidery (1964), is very similar in design and technique to this Bible cover. As such, the comparison brings the latter into association with an unquestionable piece of professional work of the very highest quality and shows the persistence of style and technique into the seventeenth century.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Satin (fabric)"

The front cover shows Elijah and the Widow of Zarapeth (1 Kings 17:8–16), and the back cover shows Elijah Fed by Ravens (1 Kings 17:1–6), two episodes in the life of the prophet when God provided for him by sending sustenance from unlikely sources, ravens and a poor widow. Although not as common as other biblical scenes rendered in needlework, the numerous depictions of the story of Elijah in paintings and engravings show how familiar these stories would have been to their seventeenth-century audience. Yvonne Hackenbroch suggested a likely source for the front of the embroidered cover in Gerard de Jode’s late sixteenth-century Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamentis, although some of the costumes were updated from this source to reflect contemporary fashion.Two factors lead to the conclusion that this decorated binding is the work of an amateur: the level of proficiency of the embroiderer and the presence of initials, presumably those of the maker. The techniques and materials employed are fewer and simpler than are commonly seen on Bible covers of a professional caliber; the two scenes from the life of Elijah are worked in tent stitch on canvas, which would have been made separately and then applied to the satin background of the book binding. The scenes are then framed in a cartouche of silk-wrapped purl thread, which is applied in a couching technique that would be relatively simple to work. A knot stitch is used on the satin background to make the floral border and the maker’s initials M.B., as well as the spine, which is covered in six registers of flora and fauna. Although tedious to work in this quantity, the stitch is not terribly difficult. The fact that this Bible and Book of Psalms were decorated by an amateur embroiderer shows that the skills so important to a young woman’s education were put to use in the making of decorative objects necessary to a properly appointed household.Like cabinets decorated with raised-worked panels, the finished cover would probably have been delivered, along with the book itself, to a binder who specialized in the application of decorative covers. The same craftsman may have applied the decorative silver metal trim to the edges, as well as the gold metal clasps. The publication date of a book cannot be used as conclusive evidence for the date of any type of cover. However, it is probable that books intended to receive decorative textile covers were intentionally constructed with smooth spines, in order to facilitate the application of the cover and to avoid interrupting the design, unlike the spines with protruding cords, which are commonly found on leather bound books of the period. Nevertheless, the embroidery design on the spine imitates the appearance of leather bindings with the horizontal cords and panels in between.[Katy Reed-Basham and Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Satin (fabric)"

The front cover shows King David in profile playing his lyre, illuminated by divine rays emanating from above. Yvonne Hackenbroch noted that this standing King David derived from a figure of David on the title page of a Bible published in Cambridge in 1629. Hackenbroch also found the source for the pose of the King David on the back cover, where he is posed facing outward and holding a scepter and lyre: the title page of the third volume of Gerard de Jode’s Thesaurus Novi Testamenti (Antwerp, 1585). The spine of this Bible has five registers, each with a tent-stitch flower typical of this period. The flowers from top to bottom are: tulip, cornflower, rose, pansy, and carnation/pink. The needle-worked binding contains three liturgical texts: the New Testament (in Greek), the Book of Common Prayer, and the Book of Psalms (with musical accompaniment).The image of King David, the supposed author of the Psalms, shown here illuminated by divine rays, was an appropriate and conventional image often used to adorn books of Psalms and other liturgical works; numerous examples survive, both professional and amateur. The British Library has several, including one nearly identical in style to the Metropolitan Museum’s copy. It, too, has been made with the sumptuous materials and high-quality craftsmanship of the professional embroiderer. It has the same raised cartouches with masks on both front and back covers but with different images from the life of David within each surround.The Museum’s Bible is said to have belonged to William Laud (1573–1645), who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633 and was one of Charles I’s chief ministers. This determination is based on an old (though not contemporary) inscription written in ink on the blue silk on the inside front cover: ""This book formerly belonged to Archbishop Laud."" If this is the case, then the book and its richly worked cover assume a powerful symbolic status. Laud was a pivotal and highly divisive figure in early seventeenth-century English religious and political life, primarily because of his attempts to reform the liturgy and to impose on the English church a richly ceremonial form of worship. This stemmed from a particular view of the divine presence within the physical structure of the church itself. The church was, as the Laudian Robert Skinner proclaimed in 1634 in a sermon before the king, the place where ""our Lord God most holy doth inhabit."" It was ""his proper mansion or dwelling place."" Such a notion of divine presence thus infused all objects used in worship with a spiritual aura. For the Laudian Alexander Read in 1636, all such objects were to be held as ""holy in relation to the holy use whereto it is assigned."" Even the cloth bags used to carry the communion bread into the church were special, ""since the very bringing of it into the church to that use is a taking out of the world, a promotion of it to more reverence and a next step to consecration itself."" This attitude promoted the value of beauty in ecclesiastical ornament and decoration. As the anonymous R.T. wrote in 1638, a church should properly contain ""all kinds of ornaments that might add glory and grace . . . as curious paintings, hangings, gilding, sumptuous vestments, rich gifts of money, chalices, plate."" Within its original context, therefore, the Metropolitan Museum’s richly adorned Bible would have seemed, as Lake put it, to ""glow with the beauty of holiness."" The sense of beauty in reverence extended also to ceremonial and ritual aspects of the liturgy, the rubrics for which were contained within the Book of Common Prayer. Strict adherence to the order of the liturgy was regarded as the surest means of true communion with God and indeed constituted for Laud the only legitimate form of prayer. Whether or not the Metropolitan Bible actually belonged to Laud, it nonetheless embodies the Laudian style, both in the text itself—the Book of Common Prayer, which, containing the whole liturgy, stood at the center of Laudian worship—and in the extravagant richness of its decoration, which infuses it with ""the beauty of holiness.""A sincere Protestant, Laud wished to reinstate such practices and objects into the Church of England, which he regarded as historically and theologically accurate and which predated the corruption of the Church of Rome. As the highest prelate in the land, he sought to impose practices such as bowing to the altar (which replaced the communal ""Lord’s table""), the use of incense in the performance of liturgical prayers, and the use of rich vestments in the exercise of the liturgy. Such actions, as well as his resistance to the Puritan emphasis on bibliocentric piety and preaching, alienated both hardline and moderate Puritans. The introduction of what were widely considered Catholic or popish customs provoked significant opposition. The rebellion in Scotland in July 1637—a reaction to the institution of a new form of liturgy modeled on the English Book of Common Prayer—was what forced Charles I to recall Parliament, which in turn set off a series of events leading to the Civil Wars and Laud’s own eventual execution at the hands of Parliament in 1645.[Katy Reed-Basham and Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Satin (fabric)"

Wool was commonly used for tent stitch or needlework on canvas from the sixteenth century, but this fiber is unusual in pictorial works such as this. Wool is more commonly found on bed furnishings of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries on a cotton twill foundation fabric.The presence of initials and a date probably indicate that this was an amateur production in both design and execution. The composition, which is extraordinarily crowded and naive, even within the genre of seventeenth-century pictures, is a small compendium of religious imagery, each story rendered in a kind of shorthand with only the key scene in the narrative nestled within the pictorial landscape conventions of this type. Hagar and Ishmael, banished from the home of Abraham, exit the scene in the lower left corner, while the princess of Egypt finds the baby Moses to the right. The river that delivered Moses flows from a rocky grotto, home to a mermaid, several types of fantastic fish, and a duck. Above the mermaid’s head at the right, Rebecca offers a drink to Eliezer from an antique urn on which the date 1667 is embroidered. The identity of the king under the central canopy is not certain, but he most likely represents Solomon sitting in judgment, as a woman appears to be pleading for a child in the arms of a cavalier with a sword. This interpretation is strengthened by the presence of a colorful moth or butterfly below the king. If we accept this as a symbol of the restoration of the Stuart monarchy, then the biblical Solomon, with whom King Charles I (father of the contemporary king) had been identified, would have been an appropriate choice. The rest of the panel is populated with flora and fauna, rendered with a typical disregard for relative scale, and a stately home with two small faces behind the mica windows. This particular conflation of religious and secular imagery is interesting for its visual emphasis on the central figure of the king, with other references scattered in a seemingly random fashion around the composition.[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Satin (fabric)"

This is the most common type of extant seventeenth-century sampler, and its standard format was established by about 1630. The foundation was generally cut from one complete width of plain-weave linen, so that the selvages are present at what becomes the top and bottom of the finished work, and the sides are hemmed. Polychrome band samplers are typical, although some band samplers combined rows of whitework, cutwork, and needle lace with the polychrome patterns (see MMA, 57.122.368). A band sampler such as this would have most likely been a task completed by a schoolgirl under the supervision of an embroidery instructor of some kind. In fact, a band sampler was usually the first piece worked by a budding embroiderer beginning at about age seven or eight. The complete embroidered works by Martha Edlin, the only extant group of a young girl’s educational work, now housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum, begins with a band sampler as her earliest accomplishment.This example, signed by Anna Bucket, introduces the band sampler into the realm of the decorative by adding an image of a courting couple at the top of the sampler. With its precise date and the name of the maker placed prominently, above the cupid who hovers between the couple, the maker may have been referring explicitly to her actual or hoped-for marriage. The couple is accompanied by a dog, symbol of fidelity in marriage, and surrounded by the heraldic unicorn and lion. The image is a miniature version of the numerous pictures of courting couples in which the man and woman stand on variegated green and yellow grass; in addition to the animals, the scene is embellished with fruiting trees, flowers, and insects completely out of scale to their human companions. This type of sampler may have been displayed in the home, as became common practice in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Contemporary evidence of this practice can be found in the criminal proceedings of the Old Bailey: in December of 1750 a man was convicted for stealing, among other things, ""one needle-work sampler, with a frame and glass.""

The tail feathers of the peacock are created from fragments of actual bird feathers, there are tiny shells and bits of coral in the grotto surrounding the fish pond, and the costumes of the courting couple include details such as real lace trimmings and seed pearls.The decoration of this mirror refers to a marital union, symbolized by the couple flanking the mirror glass, the two manor houses above them, and the figure of Harmony, in the guise of a young woman playing a lute, at the top of the mirror.

The men wear breeches and doublets, whose style and cut generally conform to late sixteenth- and early seventeenth century European dress.¹ Yet these Western garments, depicted with detailed embroidery, bear certain characteristic Chinese motifs: one man has a dragon design on his doublet, while another’s costume shows a typically Asian auspicious motif of intersecting diamonds within a diagonal lattice. In addition, the men’s features—including wispy mustaches and beards—have an Asian character. While the embroiderer may have intended to represent Portuguese gentlemen, there is a certain mixing of imagery and types here that is seen in other decorative arts of the period that depict foreigners, such as the painted Japanese Namban screens showing the ""barbarians"" arriving in Japan.²The basic design of the coverlet, which at some point was lined in a vibrant clamp resist-dyed silk from India (MMA 1975.208a-c), consists of a central roundel in a field surrounded by one or more borders; although this layout is frequently seen in works made for export, it also appears in domestic Chinese kang (daybed) covers.³ Its imagery—including dragons flanking a flaming jewel, the birds and flowers of the border, and the Chinese-style lions in each corner—is common in Chinese textiles. Some of the details, however, are unusual, or are combined in unexpected ways, suggesting the involvement of a European trader or client unfamiliar with the selection and placement of motifs in Chinese iconography. The jewel between the dragons, for example, is uniformly surrounded by flames, resembling a Western sun more than the characteristic Asian flaming jewel. And the lotus pond at one edge of the border, which would normally be the backdrop for pairs of waterfowl, such as ducks or egrets,⁴ instead features large pheasants, more often depicted in a dry, rocky setting.

The duc de Richelieu (Louis-Francois- Armand de Vignerod du Plessis, 1696 ・ 1788) collected hundreds of European textile samples between 1720 and 1736 in an attempt to document local and regional production; included in this collection are several woven silks from the Netherlands labeled “Indiennes.” This nomenclature and certain characteristics of the group have been confirmed by recent archival research in Amsterdam.¹  These fabrics have a width of about 30 1⁄2 inches (78 centimeters) and feature distinctively playful patterns with exotic elements, mostly interpretations of Chinese motifs.²  Dutch silk indiennes were certainly intended for fashionable womens dress, as is evident from a particularly spectacular example of Dutch silk weaving at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (no. 43.1871a-c). The Dutch were exporting silk textiles to England, France, and Portugal (and probably indirectly to North America through the British trade) by at least the early eighteenth century. In 1707 an Amsterdam silk manufacturer was called upon to testify to the origin of several Dutch silks after such goods were stopped by English customs on their way into London because they were thought to be from India.³ Both England and France banned the import of Asian silks around the turn of the eighteenth century as protectionist measures in favor of their own silk-weaving industries.⁴Whether the Dutch silk indiennes of the 1720s to 1750s were still confused with Asian silks is not certain; to the modern eye, they are clearly examples of European chinoiserie.  This particular pattern shows a compact walled garden with tiny pagodas flanked by oversize Chinese-style vases holding large flowers. In his 1769 memoirs Jacques-Charles Dutillieu (1718 ・ 1782), a French silk designer and manufacturer, dismissed the quality of Dutch silk designs, saying they were either bad copies of French patterns or designs taken from textiles from the “Indes Orientales” appropriated with a rather unrefined taste.⁵ While his comments are clearly untrue of this charming design, they confirm the competitive nature of the silk industries within western Europe. Although the use of fashionable textiles for ecclesiastical vestments certainly predates the eighteenth century, based on surviving vestments this practice appears to have accelerated after 1700. Eighteenth-century vestments made of dress silks are often attributed to France; the use here of the older Italian woven silk as the hood of this cope is an unusual variation on the practice.

Weigert, Textiles en Europe sous Louis XV. The textiles were collected and arranged in eight volumes that were part of the duke’s extensive library; they were sold at the auction of his estate in 1788 in a lot totaling fifty-two volumes under the heading “Records of Our Times.” See Folliot, Regnault-Delalande, Julliot, and Quillau, Catalogue de . . . le cabinet de feu M. le duc de Richelieu. . . . The term indiennes was more commonly used in France to refer to European imitations of Indian cotton textiles, but rather confusingly the Richelieu volumes also employ the word to refer to the printed cottons being made at Marseilles and Genoa.

Its slender, A-line shape was common in chasubles of eighteenth-century Spain, where it may have been used.¹ The focal point of the embroidered design is the roundel with a double-headed eagle at the center of the vestment’s front and back. Although the double-headed eagle surmounted by a crown was a symbol of the Habsburg monarchy, here it is purely decorative and tinged with an auspicious Chinese flavor.² Instead of grasping arrows in their talons, as they would in the Habsburg motif, the birds dangle flowering and leafy stems from their beaks. In Chinese textiles auspicious birds frequently hold symbolic flora: a rank badge in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection features a crane that grips a branch bearing both a peach and a peach blossom.³ The front and back of the chasuble are each divided into three vertical sections, separated by narrow embroidered floral trim that also borders the neck and edges.⁴ The central section consists of a series of vertically aligned roundels, floral rosettes, and geometrically decorated vessels resting on stands amid a simple ogival pattern of flowering vines. On each of the two side sections, a graceful design of delicately curving leafy stems emerges from a multicolored cornucopia, a long-standing European motif. Cornucopias are included in at least two other eighteenth-century chasubles embroidered in China, one now in the Metropolitan and the other in the Museo Nacional del Virreinato, Tepotzotlan, Mexico, and formerly in the Catedral de Mexico—a reminder that there were markets besides Europe for chasubles embroidered in China.⁵ The scrolling pattern of the side panels is punctuated with large flowers, some of which include elements from Chinese decorative arts and others that are unusual from a Chinese perspective—even quite fantastic. The large flowers close to the cornucopias on the front of the garment and flanking the eagle roundel on the back are rather unrefined in technique, featuring dots on their radiating petals and a bold red, white, yellow, and blue coloration that lacks the more subtle shades of light red seen in the smaller flowers nearby, a customary coloration in Chinese embroidery. As dotted petals are fairly common in Indian floral textiles of the eighteenth century but unusual in Chinese examples, these bold flowers and other similarly distinctive blooms may reflect the Chinese embroiderer’s attempt to mimic the Indian floral patterns that were so popular in international trade.

Until the later 17th century most silks were imported. But a silk-weaving industry developed in England, centred around Spitalfields in London, which grew increasingly successful between 1700 and 1760. Huguenot refugee families, contributing technical and business skills, played an integral part in its development.

Spitalfields weavers produced plain and patterned fabrics. Designs changed season by season, influenced by French fashions but developing a distinctive English style. 

This fabric, woven in Spitalfields, is a brocaded silk satin, and was intended for ladies' gowns. The technique of brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into the pattern of a fabric in specific, sometimes very small areas. It was a more laborious process for the weaver than using patterning wefts running from selvedge to selvedge, but the resulting effect could be much more varied and lively.","Satin (fabric)"

As the bustle replaced the crinoline and bodices contoured the figure, corsets became longer to achieve the desired hourglass silhouette. They encased the abdomen and enveloped the hips, and the amount of whalebone also increased to give a smoother outline and help prevent wrinkling of the fabric. This corset from the 1880s is composed of twelve separate shaped pieces and forty whalebone strips.

To improve shape, performance and comfort, manufacturers claimed numerous inventions. One of the most successful was the steam-moulding process developed by Edwin Izod in 1868, and still used in the 1880s to create elegant corsets such as this one.  The procedure involved placing a corset, wet with starch, on a steam-heated copper torso form until it dried into shape. The result was a beautifully formed corset, whereby 'the fabric and bones are adapted with marvellous accuracy to every curve and undulation of the finest type of figure' (The Ladies' Gazette of Fashion advertisement, London July 1879).

It was probably dyed with one of the new synthetic colours produced from the late 1850s onwards, although intense hues could also be created using natural dyes. The artificial forms of magenta were very popular and a battle for patents began as dyers sought to distinguish their inventions from those of their competitors. In reality many of the dye samples from different manufacturers looked exactly the same, and it was only the exotic names, claims on colourfastness and improved visual quality that set them apart. Other disputes arose over the health risk posed by the wearing and production of garments coloured with synthetic dyes. In the early 1870s a German chemist found traces of arsenic in fabric dyed with magenta, which could leak out in washing, rain or perspiration. There were also reports of serious skin conditions caused by exposure to aniline dyes, and a dye firm in Switzerland was forced to close in 1864 due to arsenic pollution.

Brightly coloured fabrics also led to words of advice from the fashion magazines. <i>The Englishwoman’s Domestic Magazine</i> of March 1868 recommended that there should be no more than 'two positive colours in a lady's toilet' and that 'very bright tints' should be toned down with white, black or grey to prevent a gaudy appearance. Two shades of the same colour were considered very fashionable, particularly if the trimmings were of a contrasting fabric. (In this example, the difference in colour between the thread and material may have become more evident over time.) Satin bows and pleated bias-cut trimmings complement the ribbed silk of this dress perfectly, while delicate puffs of tulle inserted into the sleeves soften the impact of the dramatic colour.

Women's clothes were often made from earlier fabrics, particularly when the colours, pattern and texture suited the fashions of the day.  Eighteenth century taffetas were popular during the 1820s and 1830s as these crisp silks helped the skirts stand away from the body in graceful folds and the sleeves billow into elegant puffs. The delicate floral designs, woven stripes and soft colours also complemented contemporary lines in dress.

This evening gown is made from silk tobine dating from the 1770s.  Silk tobines were taffetas patterned by being woven with an extra warp floating on the surface that was bound at intervals with silk weft threads. The warp here is in shades of red and the pattern it creates helps break up the uniformity of the stripes. This fabric was probably selected because, from a distance, the yellow, pink and red stripes resemble the 'rainbow style' prints introduced in the 1820s. 'Rainbow style' was a method of block-printing invented by the paper-stainer Spoerlin of Vienna. It was the first block-printed style adapted for roller-printing, as after the colours were applied to the cloth they were merged at the edges using a brush or roller. The result was a soft blending of colours evoking the effects of a rainbow.","Satin (fabric)"

In Spain it became established in the 16th century in place of the amice (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p.142). The five wounds gushing blood, embroidered on this collar, represent the Five Wounds of Christ, or the stigmata. These wounds were the marks from his crucifixion - one to each hand and each foot where he was nailed to the cross, and one on his right side where he was pierced with a lance. They drew attention to the suffering he experienced on behalf of mankind. It was probably made in a professional embroidery workshop or in a convent where nuns engaged in the making of ecclesiastical vestments.

Collars such as this one are often depicted in paintings of St Lawrence who died before becoming fully ordained as a Catholic priest; the combination of dalmatic and collar indicate his status as a deacon. Such depictions show that the collar fitted high around the neck of the wearer, curving round the neck so that the maximum height was at the back; the rounded front edges tied together by means of cords attached at each end and completed by a large tassle. Often the imagery or decoration on the collar echoed that of the panels on the front, back and sleeves of the dalmatic, although in miniature because of its size. Good examples appear in two paintings of St Lawrence by Francisco de Zurbaran, the first (1636) is a front view in The Hermitage, St Petersburg and the second (1638-9) is a side view in the Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes, Cadiz. The depth of colour of the dalmatic in the first of these paintings suggests it may represent quite closely the original ensemble which this collar would have complemented. Both are illustrated in Jonathan Brown. <i>Zurbaràn</i>. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1991, pp.24 & 100.

During the Counter-reformation in the second half of the sixteenth century and thereafter, the expression of intense emotion was expressed through a variety of religious artefacts, from painting and sculpture to ecclesiastical vestments. The Council of Trent (1545-63) revitalised religious art in order to arouse religious fervour. The imagery on vestments was therefore part of a wider movement in the plastic arts. For example, in Spain, the great power at the forefront of the Counter-reformation and the likely source of this collar, the Holy Week processions which immediately preceded Easter used sculpture of Christ crucified and taken down from the cross to excite emotion in the ordinary people who lined the streets. For much of the year, these sculptures were kept in their own chapels within churches, where they could be venerated. In such pieces, the agony of Crucifixion was evident because the wounds were so realistically depicted on carefully carved representations of human bodies with horrendous gashes of red wounds. The wounds on this collar are an evocative shorthand of this vivid three-dimensional imagery and would have been easily understood by a largely illiterate popular audience.

The corporal is a square white linen cloth,  upon which the Sacred Host and chalice are placed during the celebration of Mass and it is important that it is protected from dirt or contamination.The spots of wax on the surface of this piece underline the need to cover up the corporal itself.

In Roman form the burse is ordinarily made of two pieces of cardboard about twenty-five centimetres (or ten inches) square, bound together at three edges, leaving the fourth open to receive the corporal. One outer side of the burse is of the same material and colour as the vestments with which it is used; the rest is lined with linen or silk. The use of the burse dates from the 12th century. When the corporal reached small dimensions, it was carried to the altar, sometimes in the missal, sometimes in a special receptacle, a box or bag, which finally took the present form of burse. Just when this custom began cannot be determined. <i>Chronicon vetus rerum Moguntinarum</i> (1140-1251) mentions a precious corporal-case; this may have been, however, only a box for the continual safe-keeping of the corporal. St. Charles Borromeo describes a <i>sacculus corporali</i> distinct from the case in which corporals were preserved (<i>Acta Mediolan</i>, 1683, I, 524). From the fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries the use of the burse spread, and in 1692 it was universally illicit to celebrate Mass without one (<i>Decreta S.R.C</i>, 1866, ad 2m).","Satin (fabric)"

Its soft and luxurious feel, the rich and deepening effect it lent to any colour, and its versatility, made it the chosen fabric of the rich and powerful. The sinuous pattern of roses and entwining branches seen here was a popular one and assumed many variations; roses were associated with the Virgin Mary and Venus and symbolised virtue, love and beauty. This velvet is comparatively light in weight, suggesting that it would have been used for clothing; velvet draped well and greatly enhanced the silhouette of the wearer.","Satin (fabric)"

From the mid-fourteenth century onwards, velvet weavers belonged to a separate guild from other weavers, and kept their weaving methods closely guarded secrets from their competitors. The weavers' skills and techniques were revered and coveted, and so highly prized that the most specialised of velvet weavers were not permitted to leave their city's walls without permission. If a velvet weaver did take his skills to a rival city, he could expect not just the confiscation of all his assets but to be sentenced to death.

Weaving velvet was an expensive process, requiring three times the amount of silk of that used in other fabrics. The guild dictated that the weaver use the very finest of silk threads- organzine. The textile could then be made more costly still with the addition of silver and gold thread. 

The soft texture and comparatively small pattern of this velvet, combined with its light weight, suggest that it would have been used for clothing. Velvets were well suited to noble dress, not merely because their costliness demanded a certain level of income but because they draped well and enhanced the silhouette of the wearer. This velvet is a good example of the repetitive symmetrical pattern (consisting of a floral motif enclosed in ogee curves) developed and put to wide use during the fifteenth century, which continues to be employed in velvet weaves today.

While the shape and construction are entirely in keeping with that of the panels on Spanish style dalmatics, the pattern of holes down the side of the piece suggest it may have been used as upholstery. Spanish chairs of the 16th century had backs and seats of a similar size to this panel (unlike Italian chairs which had rather narrower backs, as a rule). The pattern of darning suggests friction on the lower edge of the panel, and would be in keeping with wear and tear inflicted by a seated body. The grotesque style of pattern is not unknown on dalmatic accessories, as there are collars in our collection which have such motifs, however, it is strange that there is no obvious reference in the imagery to the Church or its saints.

As an apparel panel, the object belonged to a set of church ornaments and probably fulfilled the function of a panel on a dalmatic (the priestly garment worn by deacons). The Spanish style of dalmatic had matching apparels on the front, back and sleeves, those on the body being substantially larger (squarer) than those on the sleeves (rectangles). Usually, those on the body of the garment were attached between the waist and the hemline, those on the sleeves towards the edge with the imagery clearly visible when the arm was at rest by the wearer's side. (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p.142). A second panel in this collection matches this one, and would have adorned the other side of the skirt.

If used for religious purposes, this panel is significant as an example of the pre Council of Trent (1545-63) design on church ornaments. While the Council's impact on sculpture and painting is well covered in existing literature on the plastic arts, its interpretation in textiles has largely remained hidden within specialist textile histories. 

The creation of embroidery and the learning of embroidery skills followed a similar path to that of sculpture and painting, and recently serious research has begun on its professional development in certain local centres in Spain (e.g. Marta Laguardia's work on Salamanca). Basically, skills were learnt through apprenticeship in a guild and groups of objects were made according to similar specifications (e.g. the workshop of the sculptor Gregorio Fernandez or that of the painter Francisco Zurbaran). Successful execution of standard imagery was valued (where today 'creativity' and 'originality' are highly prized). In some cases, embroidery was learnt in convents and nuns were skilled needlewomen who could make church ornaments.

A number of sixteenth and seventeenth century dalmatic collars and apparels survive in the V&A collection, divorced from their original garment (about 64). It seems likely that panels from dalmatics may have survived intact longer than other parts of the dalmatic which may have become damaged during church services or been recycled at a later date. In addition, collectors in later centuries tended to be more interested in patterned textiles or textiles with particularly painterly imagery rather than the plain silks or silks with repeating patterns that were used for the basic body of vestments.

As a furnishing, it could have been used either in the sixteenth century or as part of a 19th century revival of such styles of furniture. It is particularly rich in terms of its visual impact and its metallic threads, and would therefore be most suitable for royal furnishings (a chair such as that on which Mary Tudor sits in the Eworth portrait of about 1550, thought to have been painted for her betrothal to Philip II of Spain). Sixteenth or seventeenth-century dalmatic apparels have been used as upholstery on a simple chair of the type that was popular as a historical revival in the late nineteenth century, now in the Lehman collection. The seat backs demonstrate a desire for the opulent, decorative qualities of the embroidery rather than its iconographical content, as the design has been applied on its side rather than so that it is 'readable'.

The embroidery comprises applied (appliqué) motifs in gold, silver and coloured silk threads, the metallic threads being sewn on to the backing with silk threads. Other elements of the pattern are created in coloured silk in satin, long and short stitch. The motifs are outlined with gold cord. 

The pattern is a symmetrical arrangement in the grotesque style, which derived from paintings excavated in Rome. The imagery is not overtly religious, although the eagle was the Old Testament symbol for triumph over death and the dragon or serpent represents evil in Christianity.

Its shape and construction suggest that it may at one time have been attached to a dalmatic, the tunic-like garment worn by deacons of the Catholic Church. However, the pattern of holes down the side of the piece suggests it may have been used as upholstery, either in the period in which it was made or afterwards in the 19th century. Spanish chairs of the 16th century had backs and seats of a similar size to this panel and in the late 19th century such styles were revived.","Satin (fabric)"

Peacock feathers were a popular motif for fabrics worn by both men and women in the middle and later part of the 19th century.

Decoration and trimmings reflected a nostalgia for the costume of the past, seen in stomacher-shaped bodices and 'vandyked' (zig-zag shaped) collars inspired by portraits from the seventeenth century.

This dress may well have been a wedding dress as it is so rich in detail and trimmings. White weddings were becoming widespread as a result of the fashion for muslin dresses.

The embroidery has been built up from a base of linen, stitched in coloured silk (in three shades of green, of blue and of red), silver, and silver-gilt thread, in couching, and long and short stitch. The ground of the embroidery is executed in different textures and fillings of metallic thread, and some of it is raised work. The pattern on the velvet consists of an interrupted wavy diagonal stem, bearing on one side conventionalised pine-cones, and on the other pomegranates in a circle of leaves. This pattern is seen best on the back of the chasuble as the front has been pieced together. The back is also much less worn than the front, revealing the construction of the embroidery. It is lined in blue linen.

<i>Iconography</i> 
The orphreys depict scenes from the Life of the Virgin, mainly on backgrounds of gold and silver and were originally intended for a cope rather than a chasuble. They have been mutilated when recycled, the lowest compartment of the design cut to suit the length of the chasuble, and two of the remaining compartments used to trim the neckline. They have been unsympathetically used, so that the same scene is at the same level, but cannot be read left to right. Each scene comprises a group of people in an architectural setting, definitely classical in line rather than Gothic.The folds on the clothing of the figures are very carefully delineated.

Round the neck: 
(1) the death of the Virgin, lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles, and 
(2) the Assumption of the Virgin, borne up by angels with St Thomas by the tomb below.

On the back: 
(1) the Anunciation; the Virgin seated, the Angel kneeling, God the Father appearing in the clouds and the Dove descending; 
(2) the presentation of the Virgin in the Temple; she ascends the stair to the High Priest, her parents, St Anna and St Joachim, wait below; 
(3) the meeting of St Anna and St Joachim; they embrace before the Golden Gate of Jerusalem, an angel touches their heads and a manservant and maidservant attend them; 
(4) the rejection of St Joachim's offering: he carries away a lamb from the altar behind which three priests are sitting or standing; 
(5) the angel appearing to St Joachim among the shepherds, the lower part is missing. 

On the front orphrey: 
(1) the Announcement of the approaching death of the Virgin, she is seated, the angel bearing the palm kneels to her, behind her stand a group of the Apostles; 
(2) the betrothal of the Virgin to St Joseph; the priest joins their hands in the presence of St Anna and three suitors; the two figures on the extreme outer edges are very fashionable dressed for the mid 15th century
(3) the birth of the Virgin; St Anna in bed, a woman beside her and a servant bringing a bowl, the lower part cut away.","Satin (fabric)"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/35303835-6b39-340a-8bf9-56fc1ce286fe","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","This is a chasuble, the vestment (priestly garment) worn by a Catholic priest when celebrating the mass (the main service of worship). Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. The front is more worn than the back because it has rubbed against the altar. The embroidery on the orphrey bands tells the story of the Life of the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus Christ, from the moment the angel announced her forthcoming birth to her mother St Anne, until her journey to heaven after her death.

The silk velvet of the chasuble was probably made in Italy, which boasted the most sophisticated centres of silk manufacturing in Europe in the 15th century. The style of the embroidery on the orphreys is very similar to Florentine paintings of the early to mid-15th century. The shape dates to the 17th century or later. Precious silk and fine embroidery, especially containing metallic threads, were used economically and were often recycled.","Satin (fabric)"

The chasuble is an example of the richly decorated vestments commissioned for use in the Church. This particular example is typical of the International Gothic style favoured in the fifteenth centuries, the silk velvet characterised by scrolling motifs consistent with a dating of the late fifteenth century. Such a silk was suitable for both secular and ecclesiastical use, and might have been made in an Italian or Spanish centre (the most developed in Europe at this time). At that period chasubles were conical in shape, rather than fiddle- or violin-shaped, so this garment must have been altered at a later date (after the beginning of the seventeenth century). The silk may even have begun its life as a different form of dress or furnishing altogether, no major distinction between secular and ecclesiastical designs being made at that time. The orphreys may well date to earlier in the century, their composition and treatment being similar to Italian paintings of the 1420-50 period. The dimensions of the compartments of the orphreys may be useful eventually in identifying the geographical location of making (when guild regulations become easily accessible for different cities). Currently, identification can only be speculative, based on the aesthetics of the images. It is possible that these orphrey bands were originally intended/used for a cope. The embroidery was probably executed either in a professional workshop (urban or church) or by nuns. Certain similarities with the needlework image of St Verdiana (Viridiana) (4216-1857) in terms of composition and architectural setting are very evident; it is thought to be Florentine.

<i>Iconography of orphreys</i> 
The Life of the Virgin is told in the embroidered panels on the orphreys in eight vignettes, including the Annunciation and Assumption. Rogers and Tinagli note that from as early as the 2nd century, Mary's virtues of humility, obedience, modesty and silence were extolled in contrast to Eve's negative characteristics, and that in the early fifteenth century such ideas were communicated to a wider audience visually via Fra Angelico's Annunciation scenes, and verbally by preachers such as the Franciscan Bernardino da Siena (e.g. in a 1427 sermon). Devotional activities focussed on different aspects of her life and were encouraged in Italy by both the church and the state, and many groups - not just women - felt drawn to her cult.  Rosika Parker suggests that 'heroic women who transcended in virtue all women and all humans' became a popular theme in Renaissance writing, and that they were increasingly portrayed as meek and domesticated figures. At this time, celebrations of the Assumption of the Virgin were increasingly embroidered on ecclesiastical vestments , complementing her image as Mary the mother. In this representation, the architectural sets and the scenes with her parents undoubtedly stress her humanity as well as the importance of her role as the mother of Jesus Christ.

Some women embroidered the ready-made uppers of their slippers themselves although it is difficult to say whether this was the case here.

Plain sewing - hemming and seaming - was of particular value for the production of underclothes and basic household linens.  Only a privileged few, however, were able to afford the time and materials for embroidery.  There appear to have been a number of accepted markers in the development of a competent needlewoman.  First a band sampler was completed, illustrating the range of stitches and techniques that the girl had mastered.  Then these skills were developed by sewing a more complex and demanding cut-work sampler.  In many cases the final challenge was the production of a casket like this one, depicting scenes from myth or the Bible using a wide range of stitches and materials.  In particular these caskets employ raised work, the technique of embroidering over padding.

It is probable that each individual figure or element was sewn independently and then applied to the delicate white satin background.  This meant that the needlewoman could experiment and correct mistakes which would be impossible to rework on the satin.  Once the panels were completed they were sent to a local cabinet-maker who mounted them on wood and made them up into a casket.  The silver braid conceals the joins and prevents the satin from fraying. 

Different scenes, almost certainly derived from contemporary prints, adorn each of the five visible surfaces of the casket.","Satin (fabric)"

This richly embroidered waistcoat is an example of lavish European court dress. The bright yellow colour was fashionable for both men and women. The generous length and the pocket flaps allowed for rich decoration. The design includes Rococo motifs such as a sinuous pattern of scrolling leaves, but the bold treatment and large scale of the vegetation are more characteristic of the earlier Baroque style. The metal threads, when new, would have created a glittering effect.

The length of the waistcoat and the sumptuous embroidery and are both characteristic of the period and the rich yellow of the dyed satin was fashionable in men’s and women’s dress from the 1730s until the 1780s.

The scale of the embroidery pattern, its range of textures and use of metallic threads are reminiscent of the Baroque style, commanding splendid effects in rich materials. However, the design demonstrates characteristic Rococo elements of scrolls, naturalistic ornament and extravagant forms; with the regular sinuous pattern of ornate scroll shaped leaves and diapered infilling introducing the lighter grace of the Rococo style.

It became a popular ground for embroidery and machine-made laces. Its light weight and airy texture suited the simple style of early 19th century women’s dress. This example in black allows for a dramatic contrast when worn over a white under-dress. The applied satin rolls and rosettes at the hem and shoulders were a new decorative trend in women’s dress, which was moving away from the very plain styles of earlier Neo-classical dress. Between 1815 and 1820 the waist was very high, reducing the bodice to narrow strips of fabric at the front and back.","Satin (fabric)"

It is said to have been worn by Cara Leland Huttleston Rogers of New York, later Lady Fairhaven. 

The bodice is waist length, panelled with satin and edged with black moiré ribbon.  It is trimmed at the back with a made-up bow with long pendant ends.  The dress fastens at the shoulder over a boned, green silk bodice lining.  The sleeves are long with a high pleated shoulder.  Collar and cuffs are faced with gold beaded tulle.  The skirt has a slightly draped front, with the back flared and arranged in deep pleats.  It is mounted over a green silk petticoat, and boned and taped to a bustle shape at the back.  The skirt may have been altered and have lost a side panel.  

A machine-woven label 'Worth Paris' has been stitched to the waist tape. Charles Frederick Worth (1825-95) was a celebrated Parisian couture dressmaker.  He was born in 1825 in Bourne, Lincolnshire, and started working at the age of 12 in a draper's shop in London. Eight years later he moved to Paris, where he opened his own premises in 1858. He was soon patronised by the Empress Eugenie and her influence was instrumental to his success. Made-to-measure clothes from Worth, as from the other great Parisian fashion houses, were an important symbol of social and financial advancement.","Satin (fabric)"

It was worn by Mrs Granville Alexander, a daughter of the U.S. sewing machine pioneer, Isaac Singer. The donor was her great-niece.

The bodice is seamed and gored for a moulded fit. It extends into drapes at the hips and merges with the train, which falls in inverted pleats from the seams of the bodice. The inside of the skirt is hooped at the back, with tapes for adjustment, to create the bustle effect.

Originally part of a much larger ensemble (thirty-six roundels and panels are now dispersed among public and private collections), the embroideries may have decorated a liturgical vestment, an altar frontal, or possibly a combination thereof, constituting a set of vestments. Having left the Roman army, Martin devoted himself to religious life and became a disciple of Saint Hilary, Bishop of Poitiers in France. Saint Martin is portrayed kneeling before the Bishop, who is ordaining him as acolyte. This series of embroideries, if not originally intended for a liturgical garment, may have embellished an altar frontal, similar to the blue covering that appears here on the altar behind the kneeling figure of Martin.

Pugin's ecclesiastical work was organised by John Hardman & Co., the Birmingham ecclesiastical suppliers, with whom he is closely associated. 

Pugin's embroidery was carried out in Hardman's own embroidery workshops, run by Mrs Powell, John Hardman's sister and the wife of his partner, and by Lonsdale & Tyler of Covent Garden, who produced all forms of uniform and regalia work. Mrs Powell set up her business in 1842 to deal with the increasing interest in vestments and church decoration arising from Pugin's work. She also employed another Birmingham firm run by the Brown sisters (Lucy and Winifred), whom she took into partnership in 1852.

Houghton  was built between 1722 and 1735 for Sir Robert Walpole, England's first prime minister. This suite furnished the second state apartment, which was initially planned as a large bedroom and smaller dressing room; but before the apartment was finished the dressing room became the bedroom, and the bedroom was turned into a cabinet of paintings. The bedroom houses a bed with colourful embroidered hangings, which appears to have been made around 1715-20 for an earlier house at Houghton. The green velvet chairs were probably made in the late 1720s, in a slightly old-fashioned style to suit the bed. The use of burr-walnut veneer (cut from the root parts of the tree), with carved and gilt gesso ornament, is a mark of the very highest-quality chair-making of the period.

This is a very rare example of the use of velvet in 18th-century women’s dress. Normally fabrics are printed after the weaving process. In the chiné technique, the warp threads are printed before, and during weaving the slight pulling of the threads gives the pattern a blurred effect, resembling a watercolour when finished. In this extraordinary example, the chiné process has been combined with velvet - a difficult technique that was produced only in a few places in France. The silk for this fabric is reputed to have cost 36 shillings a yard. With an average of 17 yards required for a sack and petticoat of this style, the fabric would today cost about £2,200.","Velvet"

The sleeves are lined with linen; the bodice with white silk taffeta, open at the back.  The sack  has two, double box pleats at the back, extending from shoulder to hem.

The sack and petticoat were altered in the late 19th century for fancy dress.  The binding of the petticoat waist was removed and adjusted to lengthen the petticoat.  The seams of the sack  side gores were restitched to alter the shape of the skirts.  The waistseam at the fronts was unpicked and resewn.

Detailed description of the underside of the outer lid (undated, from curatorial file):
The outer lid is lined with gilt and painted leather decorated with badges and personal devices of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. The background of the leather panel is of a tan colour with an overall pattern of interlacing four-lobed knots forming four rows each containing five circular divisions, in which are painted the badges. The arabesque pattern does not quite fit the size of the lid, and gives the impression of being a section cut from a larger piece of leather decorated with al all-over pattern. The badges are as follows:

Top row, left to right:
1)	On a blue ground, a lozenge in gilt with a red ground within it on which seems to be painted a pomegranate dimidiating a rose, (this area is badly rubbed). A badge of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon. 
2)	Gilt concentric circles with a palmette design outlined in black, enclosing a gold fleur-de-lis on a green ground. A badge of Edward III and Henry VII also adopted by Henry VIII.
3)	On a blue ground, a gilt 8-pointed star formed of a square on a square and enclosing a gold rose on a red ground. A badge of the Tudor house.
4)	As 2
5)	As 1

Second row, left to right:
6)	Gilt concentric circles with a palmette design as at 2 above, enclosing device consisting of the initials H and K joined by a lover’s knot.
7)	On a blue ground, a lozenge in gilt as at 1 above, enclosing a sheaf of arrows on a red ground. A personal device of Catherine of Aragon.
8)	A gilt circle decorated with a pattern of ‘spokes’, enclosing a gold portcullis on a green ground. A badge of the Tudor house.

Materials: 
A report on the materials used for the box was made by J.A. Darrah, 17/8/1976 (copy on dept. file):
Oak: base, sides, drop front, probably the back and the lid, long side drawer (with walnut bottom)
Walnut: interior fittings and three small drawers
Shagreen dyed black (probably ray) - applied to the external surfaces
Gilt-brass - fittings
Interior surface of the lid, the lower surface of the writing surface, the lids of the drawers and compartments and the drawer fronts are covered with undyed, buff coloured leather. The basic design of the decoration was applied to this in gold leaf outlined and detailed with black pigment. Large background areas were then coloured blue, figures painted in flesh tints with brown hair and highlights applied to the gold leaf with red and green glazes. The pigments used are azurite (blue), vermillion (red), calcium carbonate [chalk] (white), carbon black, iron oxide(?) (brown), chalk and vermillion (pink), copper resinate (green glaze), dragon's blood(?) for red glaze.
The internal surfaces of the compartments are lined with scarlet cotton velvet, not available until the 18th century, and laid onto a woodpulp cardboard (not used until the 19th century). The writing surface and the large compartment have been relined crudely with a crimson silk velvet, apparently pre-18th century.","Velvet"

Oak and walnut, covered in leather with gilt and painted decoration.  The shagreen outer cover and gilt brass mounts probably added in about 1700.

This desk is a unique survival of royal luxury furniture with early Renaissance ornament.  It is painted with the Tudor royal arms and with badges and personal devices of Henry VIII and Catherine of Aragon.  An inscription on the inner lid asks God to grant Henry victory over his enemies.  The arms are flanked by figures of Mars and Venus derived from woodcuts of the Planets by Hans Burgkmair (1473 - 1531).  The painting is likely to have been executed by one of the Flemish craftsmen employed by the court.

Bought with the funds of the Murray Bequest. [pre October 2000]
This box has many trays and compartments for writing implements. Several such boxes were recorded at Greenwich Palace when Henry VIII died in 1547. The royal arms and badges of Henry and Katherine of Aragon appear among figures and motifs based on Continental designs. The figures of the Roman gods, Mars and Venus were based on woodcuts by the German artist, Hans Burgkmair I ( 1473-1531), published in 1510. []","Velvet"

Most of the textiles date to between 1660 and 1700. It is quilted in a design of geometric shapes that follows the design of the patchwork in some areas (a technique now known as 'stitch in the ditch'). It is deeply quilted with wool wadding, and has a reverse of an English or Dutch block printed cotton of red and purple flowers of the same date. It is bound at the edges with pink silk, and was probably intended for a child's bed.","Velvet"

The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples. 

Quilting is a method of stitching layers of material together. The layers are most commonly divided as follows:

Quilt top: The decorative layer of the quilt. If the top is pieced (such as this example), it is known as a 'patchwork quilt'.

Wadding/batting: A layer of cotton, wool, polyester, silk or other material, which adds warmth and dimension to the quilt. 

Reverse: The bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric. 

Hand-quilting is done on a frame using needles called 'betweens'. The stitches are executed with one hand; the other hand is kept underneath the quilt to feel for the needle. Small, uniform stitches (usually a 'running stitch') are taken through the three layers to form a decorative design.

This small cot cover is thought to have been created by Priscilla Redding of Deal, Kent. Born in Deal Castle, where her father was governor, Priscilla Redding married in Canterbury in 1691, where she may have obtained some of the silks used here. Her contemporary Celia Fiennes described Canterbury as 'a flourishing town' with 'good tradeing in ye weaving of silks', and shopping for goods for the home was one of the primary attractions.

Few early accounts survive that document the lives of quilt makers. So it is rare to be able to link this quilt with a diary kept by Priscilla Redding. Her father, a Baptist preacher, was arrested during the Restoration, and she writes of his 'great persicution and truble' for 'not conforming to the worshipe of the nation'. She also records family births and deaths, from the arrival of her first child to the distressing loss of her only son. Both the quilt and the diary were passed down to her daughter, Susanna, before being separated at some point in the 19th century.","Velvet"

This is unlikely to have been caused by wear and tear, as the raised embroidery would have protected it; the silk may have been treated with a substance that accidentally accelerated the natural process of decay.

The repeating pattern of gold flower heads linked by short stems is rather subdued but it provides a solid pattern to contrast with the dramatic swirling silver cords that form the edging. In fact the metal thread used to create the flowers is not gold, or even gilt; it is silver strip wound around a yellow silk core, with several strands twisted together to form a cord.

The applied woven braid is also silver but appears to have a golden sheen when it is placed next to the pure silver colour of the edging. This effect has been achieved by stitching silver thread in a chevron pattern onto dark red silk cords. The cords were coiled into fluid swirls, secured by stitches on the reverse and then attached to the edge of the coat. A small square of woven braid has been inserted from the back to fill in gaps formed by the wave-like undulations which themselves have been edged with a row of tightly coiled silver cords.","Velvet"

Veneering with tropical hardwoods was the work of cabinet-makers, known as <i>ébénistes</i> (from the word ‘ebony’), whereas joinery or chair-making was the work of <i>menuisiers</i>, who made carved furniture that was polished or painted or gilded. 

John Jones, the original owner of this stool and its pair (1031A-1882), was a military outfitter, who lived in London and used his wealth to form an extensive collection of French 18th-century decorative art. In 1882 he left the collection to the South Kensington Museum, the forerunner of the V&A. Jones was taken in by some 19th-century fakes, but it is unlikely that he was taken in by these.  More probably, he saw these as useful reproduction pieces that would help to furnish his house in Piccadilly. He had a further pair which were covered in Aubusson tapestry.","Velvet"

<u>Design</u>
The cabriole legs have ball feet, each gripped by four bird’s claws, which, unusually, are pierced through at the lower end. The lower part of the leg is plain, rounded, with, above, a section carved with feathers (looking in places more like leaves), the top edges meeting the seat rail with additional, scrolled spandrel brackets. A lappet is apparently laid over the feathers, the edges moulded and scrolled into the ears of the cabriole leg with the outer edges carved as ‘reversed gadrooning’. The lower scroll of these meets an acanthus pendant, carved down the front of the leg. Below this, carved swags of fabric hang from a carved ring and appear to be looped back and knotted at the back of the leg, with carved tassels hanging down, all this forming the lower edge of the feathered section. On the knee, a scallop shell is carved over crossed palms. 
The back legs, which are continuous with the uprights and square sectioned with a curving rake, are cut on the front face cut with a decided kick. The inner edges are chamfered. 
The back is rectangular with a pierced central splat. The uprights taper upwards with an ‘S’ curve just below the junction with the cresting rail. The front faces have a moulding on the outer edge and are angled back towards the splat. This faces are carved with a foliated scroll at the base and a symmetrical device of scrolls flanking a shell.
The cresting rail is serpentine with outer corner extensions, heavily scrolled back in a tight paper-like scroll. The front faces of these are carved with acanthus and a small floral drop. The centre section of the rail is raised and is likewise heavily scrolled, the front carved with a scallop shell with crossed palms below. 
The outer side section curves of the centre of the crest rail continue down, scrolling into the pierced splat, which is composed of two opposed elongated scrolls, enclosing a circle. This which contains a carved crest showing an armoured leg with spur on a torque (the crest of Eyre). Below this is a further pair of scrolls with a leafy pendant, which touches the base rail of the splat, carved with two half rounds, one each side of the leaf. The shoe, into which the splat is fitted, is of standard pattern with a moulded top edge.

<u>Construction, seat and condition:</u>
Mortise and tenon construction, the uprights and back legs continuous. The seat rails are tenoned into the back uprights and double pegged and tenoned into blocks above the front legs. The uprights are tenoned up into the top rail, the splat also tenoned up into this and down into the back seat rail. The shoe sits on top of the back rail and sits around the front three faces of the base of the splat, and the splat is pinned forwards into the shoe. The back seat rail is set with a single piece of mahogany veneer. This is broken away in places and may be a replacement.
The seat is upholstered in green silk velvet, now much faded and worn. Underneath a finejute base cloth is visible. The webbing is black and white chevron, 4.8 cm wide with 3 chevrons, with 3 widths back to front and 3 set laterally. All of these have broken through and loose horsehair is visible above. 
The seat  has rails of oak with softwood blocks attached with large handmade nails, these all late additions. The shaped spandrel block inside the proper right back leg is a replacement and the other back block is missing. There is evidence of old nails on the top inner surface of the seat rails. The spandrel blocks on the sides are lighter in colour and may be replacements.  The shaped corner block inside the back legs are late additions. 

<u>Damage</u>:
There is a fracture at the base of the splat. The front spandrel of the proper left front leg is missing.  The end of a claw on the front proper right foot and small section of claw on PL are missing.","Velvet"

The early history of the chairs is not clear and needs further work.  The same crest was used by the Earl of Newburgh in the Scottish peerage.

It depicts the Last Supper, the gathering of Christ and his 12 disciples described in the New Testament. The embroidery dates from the period when William Laud was Archbishop of Canterbury. Laud laid great emphasis on the restoration of beauty and dignity to church decoration and worship. In the 1630s many entries in churchwardens’ accounts refer to the refurbishment of altars and pulpits and the provision of rich textiles for church furnishings. 

The embroidery is likely to have been commissioned by Henry 5th Baron Sandys of the Vyne, in Hampshire, and is associated with an altar frontal also in the Museum's collection, T.108-1963, with the Sandys arms and dated 1633. The exceptional quality and technique of the embroidery suggest that it was worked by Edmund Harrison, the King’s Embroiderer, and can be compared with the smaller picture of the Nativity in the V&A’s collection T.147-1930 signed by him. The print source for the dossal has been identified as an engraving of The Last Supper circa 1590, by Hieronymous Wierix (c.1553-1619) after Otto van Veen (1556-1629).","Velvet"

Christ is offering bread to Judas (with money bag). On the table are three platters (one with lamb) and two goblets. Two hanging lights behind, with three candles each.
The embroidery has been constructed and applied as one large piece : cream satin ground is visible in some places representing the bench coverings, but most area is taken up with the heads and shirt-clad torsoes of the figures, worked in shades of coloured silks, and their voluminous cloaks covering the rest of their reclining bodies in or nue. The table, vessels and bench legs are in silver thread.
Much black silk has fallen out. Some outlines of figures are emphasized with applied black cord, which may have been added later. The underdrawing is clearly visible in areas particularly the flesh (bare feet and faces). There is much padding under the figures which emphasizes the drapery and body contours.
There is a narrow (3cm) fringe of silver and silver-gilt at the top and sides, and a deep fringe at lower edge.
It has been applied to a plain woven linen backing.
There is some evidence of old water stains, particularly in the lower right quarter. The velvet is very vulnerable at bottom edge where it extends as far as the backing with no further protection. The velvet pile is worn in several places with two carefully darned short slits. There are some slits in the cream satin.

Adolfo was known for his extravagant patchwork evening looks. Here, he has recycled an antique crazy-patchwork quilt to make the skirt, neck ruff and wrist ruffles. Despite this element of ‘cannibalisation’, he has treated the historic textile with respect, gathering rather than cutting it to make the skirt. This appreciation of quilts as textile art first emerged in the 1960s.

Adolfo Sardiña started out as a milliner in New York in the early 1950s. In 1962, he opened his own salon, designing clothes to accompany his hats. His earliest designs treated each piece as an individual, special item that could be worn separately, or assembled together into a exuberant whole. While the concept was at odds with the principle of co-ordinating, easy-wear separates that distinguished American sportswear design, Adolfo's elaborate clothes proved popular with his wealthy customers. After the 1960s his designs became dramatically simpler and more elegantly restrained.","Velvet"

In 1955 he won the Coty Fashion award for his designs for Emmé Millinery. In 1962, he opened his own salon and began designing clothes to accompany his hats. He believed that hats should be worn as an accessory rather than a necessity, and carried this over into his clothing designs. His late 1960s fashions treated each piece as an individual and special item by itself, that could be worn together or separately. Although the principle of American sportswear embraces the concept of co-ordinating separates and a relaxed mix-and-match philosophy, the extravagance of Adolfo's designs sat slightly at odds with this philosophy. Even so, his clothes were popular with his wealthy customers.

During the 1960s Adolfo designed cloaks in felt, richly beaded and braided velvet bolero jackets, peasant-looks, and organdy blouses worn under floral overalls, or with extravagant patchwork evening looks (as here). In 1968, he remarked ""Today, one has to dress in bits and pieces—the more the merrier."" By 1969 he described his clothes as being ""for a woman's fun and fantasy moods—I don't think the classic is appealing to people any more.""

In 1970, Adolfo suddenly changed his design approach, abandoning these extravagant designs for knitwear and understatement. He continued designing splendid eveningwear, though practicality was combined with luxury, such as evening sweaters with ballgown skirts, fur-trimmed knits, caftans and evening pyjamas.

The bodice has been altered considerably, possibly for fancy dress in the late 19th century. Black linen twill was inserted in the sleeves to close the open seam.

The chapel, which is now in ruins, was the burial place of the Sandys family. At the time when the hanging was made, the head of the family was Henry Sandys 5th Baron, who was killed in a Civil War skirmish in 1644. When the Revd Joseph of Basingstoke described the hanging in 1819, it was in Mottisfont House in Hampshire, where it belonged to Sir Charles Mill Bartholemew, a descendent of the Sandys Family.

The remainder of the chapel fittings are also enumerated, from a description given by  the steward to the Mottisfont Estate, Thomas King. They consisted of an altar frontal embroidered with the Last Supper, some pieces of purple velvet with the initials IHS, a desk hanging of purple velvet embroidered in gold and silver with the arms of Sandys, two book covers and a folding cushion with the letters 'THS' on the outside and the arms of Sandys on the inside.

The front comprises almost all silk fabrics, but there are a small number of block-printed cotton patches over-printed with gold. The majority are appliqued or embroidered with silver and silver-gilt threads and silk threads. Some of the patterned silks date from the 1680s and '90s. The patches have been pieced using coloured silk threads, including green, yellow and pink. The design incorporates small embroidered panels that were worked in silk thread on a plain-weave silk ground at an earlier date. The motifs on these panels include thistles and pomegranates. A more naive hand has embroidered over the remaining patches after the completion of the pieced design. The central monogram is worked in silver and silver-gilt thread on a black silk velvet ground, and was probably inserted in the late eighteenth century.

"http://data.silknow.org/object/efa2b102-c985-3e11-b451-39992c03deb3","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","In ‘piecing’ or ‘patchwork’, small pieces of fabric are sewn together to produce a decorative design. The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as ‘piecing over paper’. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. The papers are usually removed once the project is complete. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples, such as this cover of squares and triangles. The work is often embellished with appliqué and embroidery to enhance the design. A bedcover that has been pieced but not wadded is often referred to as a coverlet.

This patchwork of fashionable silks was probably made to form part of a larger bed cover or screen, and was hand-pieced over paper. The tacking stitches and paper template are still intact, suggesting that the cover was never finished. Papers still visible in the reverse provide a record of reading habits at the time, including a newspaper from 1705 which records the trial of the notorious plotter, Titus Oates. 

For the embroidery, the maker has taken inspiration from many sources. Several of the silk patches have been stitched with motifs taken from popular prints and books, including Aesop's Fables.","Velvet"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/efa2b102-c985-3e11-b451-39992c03deb3","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","In eighteenth-century Britain, the bedrooms of the wealthy were used for the display of luxury goods. They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Ornamental patchwork bed hangings and quilted bed covers reflected a household's access to a range of fashionable textiles, from colourful imported chintzes to sumptuous silk velvets. Many were bought specially, but householders also recycled textiles from other objects, a common practice given the financial and emotional investment in valuable fabrics.

This patchwork of silks and velvets would have been made as a bedcover or screen. The original design incorporates small embroidered panels, and a wide variety of plain and
patterned silks. A less technically accomplished hand has added figurative embroidery and appliqué to many of the patches after the completion of the piecing. The additional embroidery shows a wide range of popular needlework subjects, including four chinoiserie figures and a scene from Aesop’s fable ‘The Fox and the Vase’. 

No information concerning the provenance of the coverlet was available when it was acquired, but when the later lining was removed for conservation, it revealed an early eighteenth century paper template. Newspaper cuttings relating to the trial of Titus Oates and an advertisement for a proprietary medicine date the template to around 1705. Plain paper has also been used in several areas. Because paper was an expensive consumer item, it was common practice in even the wealthiest households to recycle it. Alongside the range of silks, this suggests an affluent household with access to a range of luxury consumer goods. In 1709 the Female Tatler described the exciting experience of shopping for such goods: ‘The shops are perfect gilded theatres . . . As people glance within their doors, they salute them with – Garden silks, ladies Italian silks, brocades, tissues, cloth of silver or cloth of gold, very fine mantua silks, any right Geneva velvet, English velvet, velvet embossed.’","Velvet"

The growth of the sleeve was balanced by an increase in the size of the skirt. In about 1892, flared skirts were introduced. They grew to their widest extent in about 1895, along with the sleeve, and had names such as 'the bell', 'the fan' and 'the umbrella skirt'.

They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Ornamental patchwork bed hangings and quilted bed covers reflected a household's access to a range of fashionable textiles, from colourful imported chintzes to sumptuous silk velvets. Many were bought specially, but householders also recycled textiles from other objects, a common practice given the financial and emotional investment in valuable fabrics.

Beautifully worked bed hangings and bed covers were found in both middle-class and aristocratic households, and could often be more costly than the bed that they dressed. Some were purchased from professional centres of production such as Exeter.","Velvet"

At the lower edge of the quilt there are split sides for ease of fitting around the post ends of a bed. The design of the quilt is near-symmetrical, with the exception of one particularly early black and pink silk that has been used only in the proper right lower corner of the cover. This silk is thought to date from the 1670s. The maker has used 5 different colours of plain silk velvet (red, green, blue, black, gold) and 1 patterned velvet (deep red/orange and black). At the head of the quilt is a Coat of Arms in silver gilt thread on a blue velvet ground, showing a rampant lion. The maker has also used a wide variety of complex weave textiles, including a green and silver thread bizarre silk dominated by a silver ground, and a blue silk with brocaded pomegranates and flowers in silver and silver gilt thread, both thought to date from the 1690s. There are yellow, pink, blue and green taffetas, and pink and yellow tissues. A brown tissue has been used extensively on the right and left borders. There is also a late 17th century yellow silk which is possibly Chinese, and a silver gilt tissue with brocaded flowers which seems to be of Persian design.

Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples, and the work is often embellished with appliqué and embroidery.

Quilting is a method of stitching layers of material together. The layers are most commonly divided as follows:

Quilt top: The decorative layer of the quilt. If the top is pieced, it is known as a 'patchwork quilt'. 

Wadding/batting: A layer of cotton, wool, polyester, silk or other material, which adds warmth and dimension to the quilt. 

Reverse: The bottom layer, usually made from one piece of fabric. 

Hand-quilting is done on a frame using needles called 'betweens'. The stitches are executed with one hand; the other hand is kept underneath the quilt to feel for the needle. Small, uniform stitches (usually a 'running stitch') are taken through the three layers to form a decorative design. This bed cover has been quilted with a technique now known as 'stitch in the ditch': quilting along the seams of the patchwork to enhance the pieced design.

According to the donor, this quilt was made for Bishop's Court, a medieval manor house in Devon once used by the Bishops of Exeter and later purchased by the Earl of Bedford. In 1651, the house was bought by Peter Beavis, son of a wealthy Exeter merchant. The rampant lion is thought to be from the Bedford arms, and its inclusion at the head of this quilt seems deliberately to affiliate the Beavis family with the former owners.","Velvet"

There are two separate patchwork projects evident: one on either side of the bed cover. One side has a central rosette surrounded by an intricately worked design of diamonds and triangles, made into larger squares by small lozenge-shaped pieces of black and green silk. Four quarter-rosettes sit in the corners, and the whole design is surrounded by a large border of silk and silk velvet pieces worked in the design now know as 'clamshell' or 'shells', and an outer border worked in an undulating band of green and black silks in the design now known as 'running feather'. On the reverse, triangular pieces have been worked into squares. Each square block is surrounded by a narrow strip of black silk. The maker has also pieced black silk circles at the points where each square block meets the next, resulting in a complex design. The whole bed cover has been worked over a newspaper template, pieces of which are now visible where the black silks have disintegrated.","Velvet"

The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as 'piecing over paper'. A pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut out. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. A bedcover that has been pieced but not wadded is often referred to as a coverlet.

The complex, double-sided design of this coverlet would have been pieced over paper when it was first created. At some point in the nineteenth century, repairs have been made to some of the more fragile silks and silk velvets. It was probably at this point that whole sheets of newspaper were used as an interlining, adding strength and stability to the original coverlet.  Paper was handmade until the mid-nineteenth century and was both expensive and extremely useful.  Waste-paper was a valuable household commodity and was often kept over a long period.

Although very little was known about this coverlet when it was acquired in 1937, the papers now visible through the damaged silks provide a record of the household's reading habits. Most are taken from newspapers dating from the 1780s to 1840s, and include trial reports and racing calendars from the Leicestershire area.","Velvet"

This is one of the few patchwork quilts of completely plain fabrics in the V&A's collection. The design of the quilt mixes early and late traditions, with a formal, framed centre made of repeating six-point stars and hexagons. The use of plain silk dress fabrics for this patchwork quilt has provided a design of vibrant contrasting colours, with surprising combinations such as bright blue and brown. The colours used provide a perfect display of fashionable British taste in the third quarter of the nineteenth century.

When the quilt was donated to the museum in 1937, it was said to have been worked by the donor's ancestor, Sarah Tomes (1792-1870), at around the time of her marriage in 1813.

The colours used provide a perfect display of fashionable British taste in the third quarter of the nineteenth century, when developments in the textile industry led to a new range of brightly coloured dress and furnishing fabrics. Chemical aniline dyes, first discovered in 1856, proved particularly successful when used on silks of the period. This lead to a move away from the cottons which had dominated the market in previous decades. By the 1860s, women across the country were acquiring fashionable silks for use in their domestic patchwork projects, including quilts, cushions, piano covers, table covers and sofa pillows, and for small articles such as theatre and work bags.

The turban was a popular form of fashionable headdress from the 1790s until 1820s. Inspired by interest in the classical world and exotic ideas of the East, the form and style of fashionable turban changed frequently. This tartan turban, with its emphasised front and velvet banding is typical of styles of the mid-1820s.

Traditional Scottish dress and tartan in particular, had been popularised in the late eighteenth century by the Prince of Wales, later George IV.

The classically inspired 'sandal shoes', with their square toe and throat, flat soles, rosettes and ribbon ankle ties, continued to be worn in black or white for formal wear but by the 1850s more elaborate styles began to emerge and heels came back into fashion.  

This pair with its lace 'fenelon' or tiered bow, a feature particular to the 1860s and 1870s,  is especially elaborate.  Two different types of lace have been used for the edging and the bow, and the addition of a gilt buckle set onto velvet provides a further decorative flourish.  It is not clear whether the lace and buckle were added by the manufacturer, the retailer or the owner.  However, although the satin uppers and leather covered heel appear to have been sewn neatly by machine the applied ornament has been hand-stitched rather crudely.  Sewing machines for use with leather only came into use from 1856 and this helps to date the shoes more accurately.","Velvet"

In the 18th and early 19th centuries their theatres were relatively makeshift, but after about 1860 many became quite elaborate, with walls constructed from wooden shutters, seating made from tiered planks of wood, and canvas roofs.

The figures were carved, painted, dressed and performed by members of the company.

Knee length, with square neck filled in with white cotton 'vest' gathered to high neck, and short slightly puffed and gathered sleeves.  These have been lengthened by the addition of extra cotton sleeves, tacked in and gathered at the wrist.  The dress is long waisted and the skirt is composed of a double flounce, the lower backed with two rows of pleated stiffened muslin, edged with coarse machine made cotton lace.  Bands of blue velvet, with machine made white cotton lace applied to them, pass over the shoulders front and back, to end at the top of the skirt.  Similar bands edge the neck, balance this at the front waist, and trim the sleeves, which are additionally decorated with blue ribbons.  The real waist at the centre front and back is marked with small gathers.  The dress fastens with buttons at the back, from neck edge to skirt, the yoke is held together with two brass hooks.

The printed silk shows some irregularities, and may have been a sample fabric.  Textile workers were sometimes given these samples, which had usually been produced only in small amounts, so particularly suited to the making of children's garments.  The fairly complex construction of the garment and the bold combination of velvet and lace as trimmings suggests that the dress was made by someone who was an experienced dressmaker.","Velvet"

The thriving trade between the Mongolian Empire and Europe throughout the 14th century brought large quantities of Chinese luxury goods to northern Italy. Chinese silks influenced Italian textile design, particularly in Lucca and Venice. In this piece the rosettes surrounded by cloud-like ribbons with two tiny pomegranate buds at the ends closely resemble the cloud-like motifs, from the Han Dynasty.

The Visconti and Sforza dynasties (of 15th and 16th-century Milan) often used clouds with other devices, such as the Dog, the Axe, or the Rainbow. The inifinite knot motif was popular throughout the Po Valley in the second half of the 15th century, and appears in many illuminated manuscripts from Lombardy.","Velvet"

Above the waist, pleated bodices, wide necklines, balloon-like sleeves and intricate hairstyles were topped off with striking bonnets such as this example in the V&A's collection.

This hat is made from a base of straw plait, carefully stitched together to form the high crown and dramatic brim. The straw has been covered entirely with velvet and subsequently decorated with wide silk satin ribbons which have been carefully pinned into place. The ends of the ribbons have then been cut into a zigzag finish. 

Bonnet trimmings were constantly changed and updated in order to give a new look, and as such ribbons and trimmings are often pinned into place as opposed to being sewn, especially on a fabric such as velvet which would mark easily.

Until the mid-nineteenth century, black dye was often created from wood components and was notoriously unstable, often fading to a brown or purple shade. The velvet on this bonnet has faded softly to a dark brown but the ribbons retain their colour.  

The 'Merry Widow' cap designed by milliner Stephen Jones for his 'Albertopolis' collection, Autumn/Winter 2009 was directly inspired by this bonnet.","Velvet"

The front legs and arm supports are turned as columns, except for the sections where the seat rails and stretchers are jointed to them; the back legs, back uprights and the foot-level stretchers on all four sides are of rectangular section, the back with a marked rake above the seat rail. The rectangular back and seat are upholstered in red velvet, the velvet of the seat a replacement. Originally the chair would have had turned finials at the top of the back uprights, gilded and decorated to match the rest of the frame. 

The frame is painted on all visible surfaces with polychrome decoration of naturalistic English flowers (possibly anemones or roses) on a gilt-gesso ground. In several places (notably on the outer sides of the lower back uprights) the flowers are set against a background of dense gilded arabesques on a red ground, and it seems likely that this ground was originally present everywhere on the chair. The decoration is very much degraded, with much loss of surface, so reading the original scheme is not easy. The arabesque background to these areas was painted with gold powder in a varnish, over a ground that was painted with a transparent red glaze over the base gilding. The naturalistically painted flowers, which include anenomes and roses, are painted in translucent and solid colours (pinky red and a malachite-like green predominate), with black-line details. 

The rectangular seat and back, and the down-curving arms are upholstered in red silk velvet, which survives from the original scheme, although much degraded. On the back the original 21"" (54 cm) width of the velvet is visible in the vertical seams to either side. On both back and arms, the seams (sometimes re-sewn) show fragments of metal-thread trimming. The velvet on the arms has been mounted down onto new velvet. On the back, a shadow line running horizontally just above the arms, would originally have been covered by a deep fringe.Similar fringe, perhaps of different widths would also have hung from the bottom of the back, from the ege of the seat (which would have had a loose cushion, with similar trimming) and possibly from the top edge of the back. A fragment of this survives on the lining of the back, behind the PL upright and shows it to be silver thread. 

The back is lined with plain linen canvas (possibly original), showing a crease between two lines of stitching running horizontally across the middle, with two lines of stitching.  This may relate to the line of fringing that was originally mounted on the front face at this height. Red fabrics (silk and silk velvet) are visible under this on the PL side. The lower back rail is probably a later addition rather than a replacement but the top rail is replaced.  The seat is now reinforced wtih two attached battens, inside the front and back rails of the seat. These support two softwood boards running front to back, with gaps between them.  Neither the battens nor boards show on the photograph published in 1924 (see reference to Margaret Jourdain's book) but may well have been already in place. The edges of a coarse linen base cloth are visible in that photo and it may be the base cloth that currently sits above the softwood boards, supported on two lateral, plain-weave lengths of webbing. This idea is further supported by a black and white photograph taken from the back of the chair, presumably at the same time as the photo published by Margaret Jourdain and now in the collection of Fortt negatives held by the Furniture, Textiles and Fashion Department at the V&amp;A. It appears to show the current canvas. Derek Balfour (conservation upholsterer) and Frances Collard (V&amp;A curator noted in the 1990s that the double-thread weave of the canvas was similar to canvas on other chairs of the period which are known to retain their original upholstery. The nails that attach the battens could be earlier than 1924, although the crimson velvet (possibly cotton) dates from after that time. 


The chair is of standard mortise-and-tenon construction.  The arms show a down-curving profile and are notched on the underside about half way along, in a manner that is generally seen in oak armchairs of the 17th century. Because the upholstery has been repaired, it is difficult to understand how this appeared when the chair was new.","Velvet"

Here, the weaver worked with crimson pile and yellow pile. The pattern is based on staggered rows of medallions, which are framed by vines set with flowers. The design is regular but you can see subtle changes of detail. For example, the arrangement of the flowers that fill the medallions alternates between rows.

The frame of the bed retains its original ropes and and linen ticking (twill in the light areas and plain-weave elsewhere) which are attached to the side and foot stock rails and a tension baton at the head of the bed. This was originally tightened by bolts (now missing) through the head rail. It has subsequently been tightened by being folded over and refixed to the tension baton. The side edges of the linen ticking are strengthened with piping and attached to the side linen sections by ropes inserted through eyelet holes strengthened with linen thread.  The top of each post has two iron hooks to secure the curtain rods. The top of the posts hold iron spikes which  secure the tester and cornice. Each of the posts have silk damask covers lined with linen. The pine tester has a horizontal subframe with a hole at each corner which slots over the spikes on the top of the posts.  The pine cornice frame also slots over the spikes above the tester sub-frame and is separated from the latter by oak spacers which are now attached to the cornice frame. The tester consists of a pine structure of thick upright sides resting on the subframe. The sides support  six pierced coved sections built up in facetted boards to achieve a coved interior - one at each corner and one in the middle of each side. The corner sections are attached to the upright sides by nails. The middle sections are attached by pine boards, nailed to the pierced sections, with holes which slot over iron eyes set into the upright sides and anchored with nails slotted through these eyes.

The tester cloth is of a different cream Chinese silk to the bed curtain linings and counterpane. At the head selvedge is a Chinese inscription. The central cartouche is made with thick pine boards curved up (by steaming?) at each end, forming a large central oval. In the centre is a smaller oval stepped to overlap the outer and providing support for yet another smaller oval. Rings in the top of the main boards provide the means of attachment to the middle sections of the coving. Traces of pencil drawings on the underside of the tester cloth provided rough guidelines for the passementerie of  braid and fringe although these were not always followed.

The outer cornice of the upper framework is covered with crimson velvet with crimson fringe. The support six(?) coronets, a pair on each side and a pair at the foot end with at the corners four acanthus leaf scrolls.  Two iron cantoon arms on brackets are fixed to the cornice frame. These support velvet cantoons, which are stiffened with linen and have separate silk linings.  The cantoons are curved at the ends (gathered by long linen stitches) and fringed all round the edges.  The cantoons are tied up with cords with tassels at each end. The velvet upper outer valances are attached to the tester frame. The silk inner upper valances are attached to the inside of  the tester frame. 

The head board similarly covered with cream silk and embellished with crimson silk braid and fringe supports a cresting of pierced acanthus plumage, and is embellished with the joint monogram of George, first Earl of Melville and his wife, Catherine. The outer scrolls support two Earl's coronets which are symbolic of  the patrons' noble status. 

Above the headboard, the head curtain of silk damask is gathered in loose vertical folds accross the centre section. It is attached to the upper framework behind the inner valance at the top, the head posts at either side and behind the carved headboard at the bottom. It is embellished with two drapes consisting of gathered silk curtains edged with crimson fringe and lined with linen. The drapes have attachments at the upper and lower fixing points consisting of choux and tassels.

There are two foot curtains and two head curtains. The foot curtains are made of five panels of velvet 50 cms wide and one panel of 10 cm wide which was designed to fit round the corner with short fringe down its seam sand a longer fringe on the bottom edge. The linings are in widths of 69 cms. The curtains end approximately 18 cms from the floor. Both curtains have cords attached to the top ends with tassels at the ends for pulling the curtains along the rods.  The head curtains are made up of two 50 cm widths of velvet. The base valances are attached to the base rail and are in two sections. The upper section consists of a pine moulding to which braid and velvet are glued and nailed with fringes at the top and the bottom. The lower sections consists of a valance similar to the upper valances with swags, bells and tassels on cords. 

The coverlet, a remarkable survival, is of silk damask embroidered with crimson braid and fringe. The central cartouche frames the Earl's monogram beneath an Earl's coronet with a pendant of simulated tasseled fringe embroidered in crimson braid. The outer borders of the coverlet are decorated with crimson fringe to form an effective edging where the counterpane is turned down to cover the sides and end of the bed. The coverlet has a specially shaped section to cover the bolster.","Velvet"

Pine carcase covered in Chinese white silk damask with details in crimson silk velvet (probably Italian) with a crimson fringe. The top crestings and corner finials are of cut pine covered with velvet. The cantoons or subsidiary curtains, are projected on curved iron supports. English between 1692 and 1707. Given by the Rt. Hon. the Earl of Leven.

The bed was made for George Melville, (b.1636, d.1707) who was created Earl of Melville in 1690; his monogram, GM, repeated in reverse, occurs on both the coverlet and the head-board, below the Earl's coronets which are repeated on the top cresting. The bed came from Melville House, Fife designed in 1692. This magnificent bed, in a remarkably fine state of preservation, has strong claims to be regarded as the finest specimen of the period and is an excellent example of the influence of the designs of Daniel Marot.

British Galleries:
This bed was commissioned by George, 1st Earl of Melville, for his new house in Fife. He had spent many years in The Netherlands at the court of William of Orange, later William III, before returning to Scotland. His new house reflected his knowledge of the most recent European fashion in furnishings. The bed was never intended for everyday use but, een so, the survival of its original silk and velvet hangings is exceptioanlly rare. [27/03/2003]

[Side 1 left-hand side- portrait of the 1st Earl]
George, 1st Earl of Melville (1634-1707)

The 1st Earl of Melville and Melville House
George, 1st Earl of Melville (about 1634-1707), built Melville House to celebrate his family's return to favour in Scotland after a period of exile at the court of William of Orange in the Netherlands. Melville's great opportunity had come when he followed William and Mary to Britain after they became joint monarchs in 1689. He was appointed Secretary of State for Scotland in 1689, then created 1st Earl of Melville in 1690.  As Lord Privy Seal (1691) and President of the Council (from 1696), Melville remained loyal to William at a time when the king's authority was unpopular with many in Scotland. Melville's decision to build a new house reflected his concern with his own status as one of the King's representatives. [133]

The house was also an expression of family pride.  Prominent on the headboard of the bed is the Earl's monogram. The bed may well have been ordered to celebrate the union in 1698 of the two earldoms, of Melville and of Leven. The Earl's younger son, David, had inherited the Earldom of Leven in 1681 through his mother. Following the unexpected death of his older brother, Alexander in 1698, David also became heir to the Earldom of Melville. [70]

Melville House
Melville House was built between 1697 and 1703 and stands surrounded by farmland, about 40 miles from Edinburgh.  For the Earl of Melville it was an imposing statement of his wealth and political success, and a monument to family status. The house was designed by James Smith (about 1646-1729), one of the leading Scottish mason-architects, in the Palladian style, with a plain, symmetrical exterior. The ground floor contained rooms for daily living, including the Earl's bedroom, while the grandest rooms of 'state' or display stood on the first floor. [90]

The state bedroom was the climax of a series of rooms fitted with the best oak panelling and marble fireplaces. The route for visitors to the house led from the great staircase, hung with family portraits, to a great panelled room for entertaining. From this an apartment led off on either side, each consisting of a drawing room, bedroom, dressing room and small private closet. The basement housed the kitchen and other services, while smaller rooms on the top floor were for other members of the household and servants. [87]

State beds
Although state beds were commissioned to provide for the possibility of a visit from a monarch, their main function was for show and they were rarely used. They were the most elaborate item of furnishing in a set of state apartments and their sumptuous textiles and trimmings were famously expensive, reflecting the riches and power of the owner. The tester (or canopy) was itself an ancient symbol of authority, similar to the canopies that still traditionally hang above thrones.  [80]

State bedrooms were usually panelled in oak and often hung with tapestries. The upholstery of chairs and stools matched the hangings of the bed, while window curtains might be in lighter silk. Floors were not carpeted and to modern eyes would look bare. Pine floors were dry-scrubbed with sand to keep them light in colour. In the area of the bed itself the floor might be covered with strips of 'Portugal matting', a light rush-matting imported from North Africa. 

The taste for complex upholstered decoration for state beds came from the work of the French-born court designer Daniel Marot (1661-1752).  His etchings of interiors and beds were published as collected sets from 1697 but Lord Melville would already have known the interiors that Marot had designed for William of Orange at his palaces in the Netherlands from 1686 onwards. It is possible that Marot designed this bed. [98]

The upholstery and his work
Like most state beds in Britain, this one would have been designed and made in London. Although the upholsterer is unknown, one likely supplier was Francis Lapiere (1653-1714), who was born in France and probably trained in Paris. He settled in London before 1683 and supplied upholstery and beds for several of the grandest country houses. [66]

The crimson velvet would have been imported from Italy, while the ivory white silk damask came from China. The trimmings would have been ordered from specialist makers, either in London or on the Continent. The upholsterer's team would also have supplied and installed the wooden frame, hemp cord, iron brackets and mattresses. The upholsterer himself might have gone to Scotland for such a prestigious commission.  [76]

The rich hangings conceal a plain oak frame. The three-dimensional ornament on the headboard and tester was created by gluing silk and braid onto a rigid, carved frame. Some of the most dramatic elements of the design were simply created by gathering the fabrics into festoons, pleats or large, loose rosettes known as choux. [72]

About 1700
Unlike most surviving beds of this date, which have been stripped and covered with new silk at some time, the Melville bed retains all its original upholstery and hangings. The ivory silk even carries a weaver's mark in Chinese characters.

Possibly designed by Daniel Marot (born in Paris 1661, died in the Netherlands, 1752); probably upholstered in London by Francis Lapiere (born 1653, active in Britain from about 1683, died in London, 1714)

The conservation of the Bed
In the clean air of rural Scotland the bed had survived remarkably well, but the polluted air of London had taken its toll since the bed arrived at the V&A in 1949.  In 1985 Museum staff started a programme of cleaning and conservation that was to last 10 years and involve 12 conservators.  Over 4,500 hours of work were spent cleaning and repairing of the bed. Even after this work, it still could not be put on show, because the old British Galleries lacked any form of air-conditioning and the dirt would have gathered again.  Now it is possible once again to show the bed, though even in air-conditioned galleries it must be cased to preserve its fine condition for later generations. [106]

Melville House was designed by the Scottish architect James Smith (c.1646-1729), it was begun in 1697 and the final masonry work and roof only completed in the summer of 1699. It would have been furnished in the next year, and the family papers record that Lord Melville was buying tapestries in London from September to December 1700. There are no surviving bills for the State Bed.
The West facing State Bedroom was on the Principal Floor of  Melville House, and the State Bed was intended as a symbol of  Lord Melville's authority. The State Bedroom formed the climax of a series of  State Apartments approached from the Great Staircase to the North of the house, which was hung with family portraits including those of the 1st Earl and Countess of Melville by Sir John Baptist Medina. The Great Staircase led on the Principal Floor to the South facing Big Dining Room which at the time of  George Melville's death was hung with four tapestries and furnished with a scrutoir (desk), a painted screen, a dozen turkey-work chairs and two tables, one oval and one square. A Drawing Room led from the Big Dining Room to the State Bedchamber. The latter was serviced by a Dressing Room, Closet and Back Stairs. The State Bedchamber opened directly into an Antichamber which in turn led to the Great Staircase Landing. The sequence of rooms is derived from a plan of the Principal and Vestibule Floors of Melville House which was drawn in 1733 to accompany an account of the lightening which struck Melville House during a storm on 27th October 1733 (Melville Papers, Scottish Record Office, GD 26/13/272). There is no detailed description of the other contents of the State Bedroom, but there is no evidence in the family papers that this room was used during the 18th century. It was created in order to receive the monarch,William III. But King William never visited Scotland. By 1733, George Melville's eldest son, David, 2nd Earl of  Melville and 3rd Earl of Leven occupied 'My Lord's Bedchamber' directly below the State Bedchamber on the Vestibule floor. In 1707 the earl's bedroom had been furnished with 'a dark colour mohair bed with a blue casnet (sarsnet) lineing/embroidered and a covering of /that same, a guilded cornice/ and feet conforme' the hangings more practical for everyday use that those on the State Bed. The other furniture included  two tapestry hangings, an agate cabinet, a walnut cabinet with a table, pair of candlestands and mirror en suite, an easy chair, six cane chairs, a cabinet for holding papers and a little writing table'.

The Country Life photograph of the bedroom shows mid-eighteenth century chairs, covered in matching velvet. There is no evidence that the State Bed was originally accompanied by upholstered chairs en suite as shown in contemporary designs by Daniel Marot.","Velvet"

VENICE; late 17th century
This handsome late-Baroque chair is interesting because it recently still retained its original velvet cover although this was in so ragged a state that the chair could no longer be shown in that condition. The original cover has therefore been removed and preserved and the chair has been re-upholstered. The surviving fragments, together with an old photograph taken during the last century (when some of the trimmings were still in their correct position), have enabled us to re-construct the original appearance of the chair although the quality of fringe cannot be properly matched today. Nor should there be a seam round the edges of the frame of the back. An interesting feature is the cord which masks the two vertical seams of the back. These seams were originally necessary because the silk materials of the time were normally woven to a width of about 21 inches. Materials has therefore to be joined in order to cover the whole width of the back of chairs. The seam was usually made as unobtrusive as possible.  The manner in which the cords masking the seams break up the surface of this chair-back may seem strange to our eyes, but the fragments show that this was how the chair was originally finished.

A chair of this magnificence was made for show as much as for use. It would have formed part of a large suite of chairs, arranged in a stately manner around the walls of a richly decorated room. 

The vigorous Baroque carving echoes the style of Andrea Brustolon (1662–1732), a sculptor and wood carver who made furniture for many of the great palaces in Venice. But it does not include the human figures for which he was celebrated.  [01/12/2012]","Velvet"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/d8635bfb-dff3-3e7c-970b-847ec020af38","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","<b>Summary description:</b>
A large armchair of carved walnut, stained dark brown, with theatrically scrolled fronts legs and arms,heavily raked back, the seat and back upholstered in red silk velvet with silk bell fringe (both upholstery modern).

<b>Decorative Scheme:</b>
The armchair is designed to convey maximum impact to the viewer. The seat and back taper outwards towards the front and the top of the chair, emphasising the perspective and giving an enhanced sense of its enormous scale.  The upholstery is covered in modern red silk velvet, trimmed with scalloped bell fringing along the lower edge of the back and the lower edge of the seat rail, the shape of the trimming adding a sense of movement to these otherwise straight lines.  

The front legs, arms and arms supports are carved in the form of bold scrolls, moulded in section and transversally ribbed in the centre where they scroll over. The front legs are each formed as an S-scroll, as are the arms, which rest on supports that scroll outwards at the base and meet the back on what appears to be the outer edge of the upholstery of the back, thus increasing the visual breadth of the back. From the mid-height of the front legs, subsidiary scrolls form the outer edge of the front stretcher, meeting at a central cartouche with acanthus leaves wrapping the top edge. The front legs are additionally carved with what appears to be a lashing of scrollwork, as if the ends of the side stretchers were wrapped round the front legs.  The side stretchers are simpler in execution but also show scrolls meeting at the centre in a cartouche, the carving on the side stretchers carrying over onto the side faces of the back uprights. These, and the back stretcher are simply rectangular in section and are undecorated.

<b>Structure and Materials
</b>
The armchair is constructed of walnut throughout, dark-stained in those areas that are visible. The back uprights are continuous and the front legs continue up to form the arm supports.  The stretchers and seat rails are tenoned into the back uprights and the front legs. The arms supports are tenoned up into the underside of the arms and cut with a stepped joint, and the arms are tenoned into the back uprights. The arms scroll outwards at their top end and are built out so that the tenon into the back upright is disguised and the joint appears from the front to be beyond the side frame of the back. The scroll is set forward of the back upholstery by approximately 1 cm, which allows for the fixing of the upholstery. 

Where extra elements of wood are required to accomodate the design of the carved scrolls, extra pieces have simply been glued on before carving, as in, for example, the scrolling front feets, which extend well beyond the legs, the scroll at the top of each arm, and the dpeth of carving in the upper half of the front stretcher. 

The back is heavily raked above seat height. The back uprights show strong saw marks on the back surface. The back stretcher has been replaced.  The joint behind the left side must have broken awayin the past and the new stretcher is now inset into the recess, rather than tenoned in. The top rail and the bottom rail of the back panel are shallower than the back uprights and are tenoned into them close to the front edge. 

The front and side seat rails have been extended with newer wood on their underside, making them deeper than the back rail and have also been reduced in thickness from the inside.  They are cross-veneered on the front surfaces with walnut.  This may have been done at the time of the upholstery that was on the chair in 1856 and may have been done to disguise the areas at the corner of the chair where the uprights might show through the corners, which were only joined by hook-and-eye fastenings. The back corners of the seat have been reinforced underneath with blocks, cut with serpentine curves on their inner faces. 

The surviving upholstery webbing is set in open format, with two lateral webs and three running front to back. It shows two different widths, the front lateral web being narrower than all the others but all seem to have been attached at the same time, with hand-made tacks over narrow strips of leather (probably dating from the late 17th century). All the upholstery above the webbing has been renewed (2011).  In 1968 it was believed that the surviving upholstery from 1856 was the original but, although the fringing may have survived from that date, the velvet and lining appear to be of the 19th century.  There are too many tack holes to suggest only two upholstery schemes before the current one and it is likely that the pre-1856 scheme was done in the early nineteenth century (possibly 1820-40)","Velvet"

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when hunting for sport was an important aspect of court and aristocratic life and had a significant role in the power play between rulers and subjects, falconry was considered among the highest status of all hunting pursuits. 

Hoods were used both as an aid to training the birds and to keep the trained falcons quiet and still while sitting on the falconer's glove. Most hoods have a plume on top of the crown which, as well as being decorative, can be used as a handle to help in the removal of the closely-fitting hood. The equipment used for hunting provided an opportunity for extravagant display, and this example is no exception, the leather embellished with gold tooling, silk velvet and highly skilled embroidery in silver thread.","Velvet"

Prince-bishop of Würzburg and, after 1757, also of Bamberg, Seinsheim divided his time between two official residences in those cities and his three summer castles, Veitschöchheim, Werneck, and Seehof.[1] Preferring the country to the city, Seinsheim spent about three months a year outside Bamberg, at Seehof, where he enjoyed walking and hunting. He was fond of gardens and did much to embellish the late-seventeenth-century castle and especially its park, where he ordered that a maze, a theater, and a cascade with grotto and trelliswork arcades be constructed.In 1761 he also resumed work on one of the ancillary buildings at Seehof, the Franckenstein Schlösschen. This garden pavilion at the east end of the orangery and greenhouses had been conceived as a place where the prince could retreat from the strict etiquette at his court. Built by the architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel (1703–1769) for one of Seinsheim's predecessors, Johann Philipp Anton von Franckenstein, prince-bishop from 1746 to 1753, the Schlösschen had been left unfinished at the time of Franckenstein's death. Contemporary records indicate that Seinsheim decided to have its two main rooms, the Saal and the Audience Chamber (also called the Arbor Room, or berceau), embellished with frescoes and stuccowork. All four walls of the Audience Chamber were to be decorated as an illusionary arbor with trelliswork and floral festoons. Franz Anton Ermeltraut, court painter at Würzburg, was commissioned to execute a small trompe l'oeil ceiling fresco. It is not known when this was finished because the work was delayed by occasional disputes between the patron and the painter and the latter's frequent illnesses.[2] No description of the room's interior was made when the Franckenstein Pavilion was demolished in the nineteenth century, but a drawing thought to be Ermeltraut's design for the Arbor Room has been preserved, illustrating its intended decoration.[3] Also, an inventory of 1774 at Schloss Seehof mentions a ""Grünes Perceau-zimmer,"" or Green Trelliswork Room, in the garden pavilion, showing that the room had been completed by then as planned.Among the furnishings listed were the two settees, together with a pair of matching armchairs and four side chairs that are also in the Museum's collection.[5] In addition, there were four wall brackets hanging in niches, two of which have been preserved as well.[6] These furnishings were described as ""von bildhauer Arbeith grün Lassirt,"" or carved and glazed green.Both the settees and the matching chairs have serpentine gilded frames consisting of large scrolls of various shapes and openwork aprons decorated with polychrome flowers and foliage. They are supported on slightly curved legs carved with a pattern of reeds, and rest on bun feet that are partly covered by foliage. Most unusual is the off-white studded latticework intertwined with gilded and painted foliage on the inner backs of the seats; this must have been in total harmony with the original setting of the furniture. The outer backs of the settees and armchairs were left unfinished, as they were intended to stand against the wall; the side chairs, however, have latticework carving on both sides and were meant to be seen in the round. Corresponding to the inventory description of 1774, traces of a green glaze, originally applied over the gilding, are still present on the furniture.[7] Subsequent inventories offer additional details about the pieces, mentioning their green silk-velvet seat cushions and their placement.[8] Being rather top-heavy and unsteady, the settees stood in two corners of the room and the armchairs are described as being fastened in the other two. Grooves in the outer backs of the settees seem to imply that they too were once secured to the walls of the room.It is, unfortunately, not known who was the maker of this unique garden-room furniture so expressive of the exuberant Rococo taste. Its sculptural silhouette and elaborate carving, the choice of linden wood, and the unusual construction and simple joinery all make it seem likely that a sculptor or master carver rather than a cabinetmaker was responsible for the set.[9] It has been suggested that Margravine Sophie Caroline von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1737–1817), of neighboring Bayreuth, presented the suite to Seinsheim.[10] This would explain the absence of bills in Seehof's archival records. The margravine is known to have visited Seinsheim regularly, and pieces of furniture were occasionally exchanged between them. Also in favor of a Bayreuth provenance is the florid style of the pieces: Rococo furniture of Bayreuth was characterized by unrestricted use of naturalistic motifs, such as flowers, foliage, reeds, and birds. There was also a preference in Bayreuth for naturalism in interiors. Several rooms in the more recent of Bayreuth's two castles, the Neues Schloss, were decorated before 1760 in imitation of latticework pavilions, the first examples of their kind in Germany.[11] A complete set of furniture would have been an unusually large gift, however. Since the Museum's suite was in such perfect harmony with its original setting, and given Seinsheim's attention to the smallest details of Seehof's embellishments, it seems more likely that the prince-bishop ordered it himself. With the exception of a corner settee in the Würzburg Residenz, no other pieces known today bear even the slightest resemblance to the Seehof set.[12] For this reason, and in the absence of contemporary documents, it is impossible to attribute the furniture to a specific artist.The settees, chairs, and wall brackets presumably remained in the Franckenstein Pavilion until it was pulled down, between 1867 and 1870, and were then transferred to the castle itself. Seehof, which was in the possession of the bishopric and then part of the Bavarian royal domain until 1842, had become the private property of Freiherr Friedrich von Zandt and his descendants. Photographs taken at the turn of the century and later show the furniture in the Zandt family dining room.[13] They indicate that large carved flowers, now missing, originally adorned the cresting of the frames. The castle survived World War II intact, but the interior furnishings were sold off after the death in 1951 of the last male heir of the Zandt family.[14] In 1956 the Munich antiques dealer Fischer-Böhler sold this exceptional seat furniture to the New York collector Emma A. Sheafer. At that time the chairs and settees were upholstered in eighteenth-century painted Chinese silk, and only the trelliswork carving on the outer backs of the side chairs was left uncovered. Mrs. Sheafer never knew the full splendor of the furniture that filled the dining room of her New York City apartment. It was with their painted silk show covers that the furniture came to the Museum as part of her bequest in 1973. Once the fabric had been taken off, a conservation campaign was undertaken. This included the reconstruction of the foliage around the inner edge of the frames, which had been cut away to accommodate the upholstery; the removal of later paint layers on the trelliswork; and the manufacture of seat cushions covered in velvet to match the originals.[15][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide 2006]Footnotes:[1] Much of the information in this entry is taken from Kisluk-Grosheide 1990.

They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, pp. 171–72.[8] See the inventories of 1802, room 57B, and 1817–18, p. 37, no. 2A, transcripts of which are kept in the archives at Schloss Seehof.[9] Linden wood was more often used for sculpture than for furniture during this period. Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately.

[the French] learn to play not barely for amusement, but also with a view to advantage; and, indeed, you seldom meet with a native of France, whether male or female, who is not a complete gamester, well versed in all the subtleties and finesses of the art.— Tobias Smollett, Travels through France and ItalyAs gaming was the principal indoor diversion of eighteenth-century France, a variety of tables was created, often for specific games like three-handed ombre or tri, piquet, or brelan. A description of one example in Lazare Duvaux’s account book suggests that this elegant folding table was used for quadrille. On August 9, 1753, the dealer sold a solid mahogany quadrille table ""I"" (folding on the diagonal), embellished with gilt bronze, and lined with cloth, to Madame de Pompadour for 85 livres.[1]When closed, the Museum’s table has a triangular shape and forms a synthesis of sinuous lines, echoed by the double curve of the cabriole legs. One of these S-shaped legs can be pulled backward to support the hinged top when unfolded. A shallow walnut drawer for storage of game essentials is recessed on top of this sliding leg. The rounded corners of the open top could be used for discarded cards and counters or for the placement of candlesticks to offer the players light on their game. Although not stamped, this table has been attributed to Bernard II van Risenburgh, based on the high quality of its tulipwood marquetry inlaid with floral and foliated sprays of end-cut kingwood.Epigraph.

Close inspection reveals the high quality and intriguingly delicate structure of the paint and the fragility of the panels, which is not evident at  first glance. That the chair and settee have survived in such good condition is testimony to the technical skills of the maker, who provided a sound base for the heavy glass strips, preventing them from peeling away over time. Nevertheless, these are display pieces that were clearly not intended for regular use. The smallest body movement of a user or any attempt to shift or lift the heavy objects puts divergent forces and pressure on their ostentatious ""skin.""The Museum's chair and settee are part of a large suite that originally consisted of at least four settees and twenty side chairs.[1] Early in the twentieth century the set was in the collection of the earl of Derby, at Derby House, London, from where it was sold in 1940 to Mrs. Violet van der Elst, also of London. The pieces were dispersed in 1948.[2] At that time, all items of the suite were covered with the bold red and gold baroque-cut velvet that still decorates the Museum's pieces. For many years it was assumed that the initials ""PPL"" displayed in a medallion on the backs referred to the Villa Palagonia in Bagheria, near Palermo, and, more specifically, to a member of the illustrious Gravina family as a patron;[3] however, as James David Draper pointed out, although ""the peculiarly Sicilian penchant for fashioning an overall look out of glass was most memorably given free rein at the Villa Palagonia, . . . the initials 'PPL' . . . do not correspond with those of any prince of Palagonia and in truth the pieces have a much more pronounced neo-classical severity than the Villa Palagonia ballroom.""[4]John Richardson, the donor of the Museum's pieces, which he had acquired on the London art market, kept them at one point in the Château de Castille in Provence, the home of the Cubist scholar Douglas Cooper,[5] who himself owned at least three chairs from the set.[6] For the moment, the original location of the suite remains a mystery, although the preciousness and labor-intensive nature of the work narrows the source of the commission to one of the great, prosperous, aristocratic families of Sicily.The back of the settee is tripartite; the medallion with initials appears at the top of the center section, but in the same place on the side sections there is a military trophy in the form of a helmet superimposed on a saber. There is a gilded openwork frieze of overlapping ellipses along the top of the back of both the chair and the settee; this appears also along the bottom of the back of the settee but not on the Museum's chair. These ellipses, rather freely adapted from ancient vase paintings, reflect the so-called Etruscan fashion of the last third of the eighteenth century.[7] A very similar pair of chairs, each, however, with an octagonal verre églomisé panel set into the back in place of upholstery, is part of the collection of Juan March Ordinas at Palau March in Palma de Mallorca.[8] That those panels show a mythological chariot in the manner of an ancient vase painting is also very much in the ""Etruscan"" style. The incorporation of glass panels in the center of the backs makes the March chairs even more fragile than the Derby House suite.[9]Other pieces from this suite are preserved in the Art Institute of Chicago (two chairs),[10] the Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida (two settees and two chairs),[11] and the Museum für Kunsthandwerk, Frankfurt am Main (one chair),[12] as well as in various private collections. Some of them have been recovered in shell pink or blue gray fabric with the intention of intensifying the effect of the same shades painted on the glass.[Wolfram Koeppe 2006]Footnotes:[1] Catalogue of a sale at Christie, Manson, and Woods, London, 26 July 1940, lot 41 (sold to Mrs. Violet van der Elst).[2] Catalogue of the Violet van der Elst collection sale, Christie, Manson, and Woods, London, 8 April 1948, lot 114 (ill.).[3] Allen Wardwell.

Prince-bishop of Würzburg and, after 1757, also of Bamberg, Seinsheim divided his time between two official residences in those cities and his three summer castles, Veitschöchheim, Werneck, and Seehof.[1] Preferring the country to the city, Seinsheim spent about three months a year outside Bamberg, at Seehof, where he enjoyed walking and hunting. He was fond of gardens and did much to embellish the late-seventeenth-century castle and especially its park, where he ordered that a maze, a theater, and a cascade with grotto and trelliswork arcades be constructed.In 1761 he also resumed work on one of the ancillary buildings at Seehof, the Franckenstein Schlösschen. This garden pavilion at the east end of the orangery and greenhouses had been conceived as a place where the prince could retreat from the strict etiquette at his court. Built by the architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel (1703–1769) for one of Seinsheim's predecessors, Johann Philipp Anton von Franckenstein, prince-bishop from 1746 to 1753, the Schlösschen had been left unfinished at the time of Franckenstein's death. Contemporary records indicate that Seinsheim decided to have its two main rooms, the Saal and the Audience Chamber (also called the Arbor Room, or berceau), embellished with frescoes and stuccowork. All four walls of the Audience Chamber were to be decorated as an illusionary arbor with trelliswork and floral festoons. Franz Anton Ermeltraut, court painter at Würzburg, was commissioned to execute a small trompe l'oeil ceiling fresco. It is not known when this was finished because the work was delayed by occasional disputes between the patron and the painter and the latter's frequent illnesses.[2] No description of the room's interior was made when the Franckenstein Pavilion was demolished in the nineteenth century, but a drawing thought to be Ermeltraut's design for the Arbor Room has been preserved, illustrating its intended decoration.[3] Also, an inventory of 1774 at Schloss Seehof mentions a ""Grünes Perceau-zimmer,"" or Green Trelliswork Room, in the garden pavilion, showing that the room had been completed by then as planned.Among the furnishings listed were the two settees, together with a pair of matching armchairs and four side chairs that are also in the Museum's collection.[5] In addition, there were four wall brackets hanging in niches, two of which have been preserved as well.[6] These furnishings were described as ""von bildhauer Arbeith grün Lassirt,"" or carved and glazed green.Both the settees and the matching chairs have serpentine gilded frames consisting of large scrolls of various shapes and openwork aprons decorated with polychrome flowers and foliage. They are supported on slightly curved legs carved with a pattern of reeds, and rest on bun feet that are partly covered by foliage. Most unusual is the off-white studded latticework intertwined with gilded and painted foliage on the inner backs of the seats; this must have been in total harmony with the original setting of the furniture. The outer backs of the settees and armchairs were left unfinished, as they were intended to stand against the wall; the side chairs, however, have latticework carving on both sides and were meant to be seen in the round. Corresponding to the inventory description of 1774, traces of a green glaze, originally applied over the gilding, are still present on the furniture.[7] Subsequent inventories offer additional details about the pieces, mentioning their green silk-velvet seat cushions and their placement.[8] Being rather top-heavy and unsteady, the settees stood in two corners of the room and the armchairs are described as being fastened in the other two. Grooves in the outer backs of the settees seem to imply that they too were once secured to the walls of the room.It is, unfortunately, not known who was the maker of this unique garden-room furniture so expressive of the exuberant Rococo taste. Its sculptural silhouette and elaborate carving, the choice of linden wood, and the unusual construction and simple joinery all make it seem likely that a sculptor or master carver rather than a cabinetmaker was responsible for the set.[9] It has been suggested that Margravine Sophie Caroline von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1737–1817), of neighboring Bayreuth, presented the suite to Seinsheim.[10] This would explain the absence of bills in Seehof's archival records. The margravine is known to have visited Seinsheim regularly, and pieces of furniture were occasionally exchanged between them. Also in favor of a Bayreuth provenance is the florid style of the pieces: Rococo furniture of Bayreuth was characterized by unrestricted use of naturalistic motifs, such as flowers, foliage, reeds, and birds. There was also a preference in Bayreuth for naturalism in interiors. Several rooms in the more recent of Bayreuth's two castles, the Neues Schloss, were decorated before 1760 in imitation of latticework pavilions, the first examples of their kind in Germany.[11] A complete set of furniture would have been an unusually large gift, however. Since the Museum's suite was in such perfect harmony with its original setting, and given Seinsheim's attention to the smallest details of Seehof's embellishments, it seems more likely that the prince-bishop ordered it himself. With the exception of a corner settee in the Würzburg Residenz, no other pieces known today bear even the slightest resemblance to the Seehof set.[12] For this reason, and in the absence of contemporary documents, it is impossible to attribute the furniture to a specific artist.The settees, chairs, and wall brackets presumably remained in the Franckenstein Pavilion until it was pulled down, between 1867 and 1870, and were then transferred to the castle itself. Seehof, which was in the possession of the bishopric and then part of the Bavarian royal domain until 1842, had become the private property of Freiherr Friedrich von Zandt and his descendants. Photographs taken at the turn of the century and later show the furniture in the Zandt family dining room.[13] They indicate that large carved flowers, now missing, originally adorned the cresting of the frames. The castle survived World War II intact, but the interior furnishings were sold off after the death in 1951 of the last male heir of the Zandt family.[14] In 1956 the Munich antiques dealer Fischer-Böhler sold this exceptional seat furniture to the New York collector Emma A. Sheafer. At that time the chairs and settees were upholstered in eighteenth-century painted Chinese silk, and only the trelliswork carving on the outer backs of the side chairs was left uncovered. Mrs. Sheafer never knew the full splendor of the furniture that filled the dining room of her New York City apartment. It was with their painted silk show covers that the furniture came to the Museum as part of her bequest in 1973. Once the fabric had been taken off, a conservation campaign was undertaken. This included the reconstruction of the foliage around the inner edge of the frames, which had been cut away to accommodate the upholstery; the removal of later paint layers on the trelliswork; and the manufacture of seat cushions covered in velvet to match the originals.[15][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide 2006]Footnotes:[1] Much of the information in this entry is taken from Kisluk-Grosheide 1990.

They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through. See Gill, Soultanian, and Wilmering 1990, pp. 171–72.[8] See the inventories of 1802, room 57B, and 1817–18, p. 37, no. 2A, transcripts of which are kept in the archives at Schloss Seehof.[9] Linden wood was more often used for sculpture than for furniture during this period. Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately.

Francesco Sforza (1401-66) adopted it as his heraldic device along with the motto <i>Mit Zeit</i> (with time). He may have been referring to his endurance and perseverance in obtaining his political position. During his reign (1450-66) the plant was represented only by the large central flower, isolated from stems and leaves and repeated across the width of the fabric three times. The motif evolved over the following twenty years into a more naturalistic version, such as is seen on this velvet.

This pattern on an even richer, gold brocaded velvet is represented on the stomacher and sleeve of a gown worn by Bianca Maria Sforza in a potrait by De Predis. This portrait was made to commemorate her marriage to Maximilian of Austria in 1493. In this context, the pattern probably referred directly to the dynasty from which she came.","Velvet"

In 1890 the German-born painter Sir Hubert Herkomer (1849-1914) was creating a house for himself, Lululaund, at Bushey in Hertfordshire.  He named the house after his second wife Lulu Griffiths. It took several years to build and more to furnish after its opening in 1894. A drawing for the house had been acquired from the American architect Henry Hobson Richardson (1838-1886), in return for a portrait.  Herkomer himself designed many of the furnishings, including this silk. His father and his uncle Johann carved  the furniture and he turned to another uncle, Anton, to weave silk for curtains and upholstery.  Anton Herkomer (1816-1901) had settled in New Hyde Park, Long Island, USA, where he became celebrated for his fine hand-weaving, much of which was exported to Europe. A newspaper article of 1896 described him as working on this project, weaving 400 yards of silk for his nephew.","Velvet"

The waistcoat back of pink ribbed silk and pink woollen twill are replacements, which have later been widened for a larger wearer.  The breeches have also been relined with cotton and white silk satin.

The thick, light-reflecting, tactile pile, which differentiates velvet from other silks, was achieved during the weaving process by using rods or wires to loop up warp threads rather than pull them tight and flat. This sumptuous example, which incorporates glittering strips of silver lamella running from selvedge to selvedge, is of a type popularly described as “cloth of silver” from the sixteenth century onward. This cloth of silver was displayed in European Textiles and Costume Figures, on view at the Staten Island Institute of Arts and Sciences (visible at far right in the photograph of 1938), and at Walton High School (visible at center right in the photograph of February 9, 1939).[Elizabeth Cleland, 2020]","Velvet"

Utilizing variations on a relatively small number of decorative motifs, most notably the pomegranate, palmette, artichoke, and garland, these silken-pile textiles developed from earlier fifteenth-century subtle voided patterns, formed by the appearance of the ground fabric where there was no pile on the surface, into visually and technically more complex designs. Here, the symmetrical pattern of elaborate artichoke forms within lobed compartments surrounded by ogivally arranged intertwined leaves and flowers is woven with metal thread, and some details are executed with metal loops (bouclé) for additional texture. The jewel-tone silk velvet primarily forms the background, which, in areas, has a subtle ""sculpted"" leaf pattern achieved by juxtaposing two different heights of the velvet pile.Woven in Italy—particularly Florence, Venice, and Genoa—and in Spain, velvets were coveted throughout Europe and also in Turkey, where production demonstrated reciprocal influences, especially with Venetian weavings. This particular example exhibits Eastern influence in the crenate collar or clip motif that secures the garlands. Contemporary paintings, inventories, and extant examples clearly indicate the international appeal of velvets and their varied uses: from ecclesiastical vestments to caftans and European-style garments for the very wealthy, to opulent furnishings, cloths of honor, and diplomatic gifts.","Velvet"

It is difficult to date this type of velvet precisely, as it was fashionable for formal interiors over a period of many years. The same type of design-large flowers and scrolling leaves symmetrically arranged to cover the entire width of a textile-also appears in monochrome damasks of the period.Velvet is distinguished from other flat textiles by its pile weave. This texture was created by an extra warp, in addition to the warp necessary for the background of the fabric. The pile warps were passed over small rods to create the loops of the pile. A polychrome velvet required as many extra sets of warps as it had colors in the pile, in this case four colors of velvet pile on a white satin background. Jardinière velvets usually had a combination of cut and uncut loops, giving further texture to the design. In this example, the combination of cut and uncut velvet on a smooth satin surface gives it an especially rich character, as all of the surfaces reflect the light differently.","Velvet"

The unidentified birds facing each other (perhaps swans or herons) are skillfully detailed by fine lines of contrasting color. The silk pile of this chasuble is composed of fours colors: two shades of green, punctuated with a deep vivid pink and off-white.

The production of luxurious silks was tightly regulated in order to ensure quality, and the movements of weavers were sometimes restricted to prevent the loss of technical and artistic advantages to rival city-states such as Venice, Milan, and Genoa. This stylized floral velvet is woven with a variation on a motif found in the Medici family coat of arms: the seven balls called palle (here, in the center of the largest flower). The placement of the red velvet circles on a background of golden thread draws attention to this feature. The original use of these fragments is not known; they might have been part of a liturgical vestment or a secular fragment.","Velvet"

The composition of this sumptuous ""pomegranate"" velvet may have been influenced by textiles from the nearby Ottoman empire; it is characteristic of Turkish textiles of the period as well.

In the second half of the century, technical innovations led to the production of increasingly complex velvets in which the richness of design and texture were achieved through the use of different heights of cut pile and of supplementary metal threads.  In this example, the broad meandering vine and the stylized foliage are woven in metal-wrapped thread with some details in raised loops to give even greater tactile effect.","Velvet"

Small elements—fruits, flowers, and leaves—were worked in tent stitch on canvas and then applied to the dark velvet foundation on which was worked the river in the Garden of Eden, the figures of Adam and Eve, and God the Father, in polychrome silk and metal threads. The garden is monumental, almost overwhelming the figures. The three trees that anchor the composition would have brought to mind the biblical description of trees in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. The scene of Adam and Eve being expelled from Eden on the far right may also derive from a reading of contemporary vernacular English Bibles, rather than any pictorial convention. Adam and Eve wear garments that suggest articles of late Elizabethan dress and the Geneva Bible of 1560 referred to their first clothes as ""breeches."" In this and other embroidered renderings of the story of the expulsion from Eden, Adam and Eve are treated more gently by God and the expelling angel than they are in contemporary print sources.","Velvet"

It was part of the insignia of office of its custodian, the Keeper of the Great Seal (a post often contained within that of the Lord High Chancellor) and one of the most elaborate symbols associated with that high office. The king’s Great Seal was attached to all writs, letters patent, charters, and royal proclamations and was the ultimate symbol of royal authority. Something of the aura that attached to the physical object may be seen in the sense of responsibility its keepers felt in its safekeeping. When a Thomas Sadler broke into the house of the chancellor, Lord Finch, and stole the mace and burse on February 7, 1677, he failed to take the Great Seal itself, as Lord Finch kept it under his pillow.The present example dates from the reign of the first Hanoverian king, George I, and although the coat of arms would be particular to each monarch, the general form and decoration had been established earlier. A portrait of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, dated 1579 and housed in a private collection, shows him with an embroidered burse heavy with metal thread on a red velvet ground, with the monarch’s coat of arms and initials, foliate borders, and applied tassels, which is the same in essence as the Hanoverian example. The burse of Elizabeth I’s last Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Sir Thomas Egerton (appointed 1596–1603), which is today in the British Museum, is also centered by the queen’s coat of arms flanked by a lion and a Welsh dragon rampant, surmounted by the letters E.R. and bordered by scrolling foliage. This pattern was followed in succeeding examples, evident in the burse held by Sir Orlandus Bridgeman, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal between 1667 and 1672, in the engraving by William Faithorne. One of the ceremonial uses of the burse was to be carried in procession at shoulder height by the Lord High Chancellor preceding the monarch. The burse of Francis North, Baron Guildford (1637–1685), appointed Lord Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal in 1682, survives today in the Burrell Collection.Given its symbolic purpose, the burse was made from the finest and most precious of materials by royal embroiderers and therefore represents the pinnacle of professional embroidery of the period. As such, it displays a veritable catalogue of different uses of metal thread, couching techniques, and appliqué. These techniques are also to be found on heralds’ tabards, robes of state, and other greater and lesser articles of ceremony, and were used in varying levels of detail, relief, and material according to a judicious hierarchy of workmanship that was attached to works made for court ceremonial. The embroidery is almost sculptural in character. The applied raised work in high relief is well dispersed throughout the composition of the square bag, comprising the main decorative elements: the Royal Hanoverian coat of arms at the center, the lion and unicorn rampant on plinths, an orb at the bottom center, and winged putti’s heads punctuating the corners and middle of the sides of the border. All of these elements are composed of couched metal threads of varying width, tone, and form to create a variety of contrasting textures. The colors are concentrated around a palette of gold, silver, and crimson, traditionally associated with English royalty since the time of William the Conqueror (whose arms are included on the first half of the upper left quartering of the coat of arms on the burse, the ""three lions passant gardant or""). The texture achieved by virtue of tightly coiled silver purl in the unicorn’s muzzle or the sinuous undulating ribcage of the lion’s chest demonstrates the skill in manipulating metal threads to give the impression of the natural fall of groomed fur.The arms themselves are those of King George I. To the existing royal arms of the quartered fleurs-de-lis of France, rampant red lion of Scotland, lions passant of England, and harp of Ireland, the Hanoverian arms have been included in the lower left quadrant: two lions passant for Brunswick, harts and a blue lion rampant for Lüneburg, and a white or silver horse for Westphalia. Over this is a diminutive escutcheon with the crown of Charlemagne, an emblem associated with George I’s title as Arch-Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire. In the course of his reign, George I appointed three Lord High Chancellors, and so there are three possible possessors of this burse: William Cowper, 1st Baron Talbot of Hensol (1714–18), Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke (1718–25), and Peter King, 1st Baron King (1725–33). The extravagant three-dimensionality of the burse shows the continued flourishing of professional embroidery at court into the eighteenth century.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Velvet"

A specialty was polychrome-velvet weaving, as in this fabric, which possibly was intended to be used for an elegant wide-skirted mantua, or gown. Although the pattern repeat of stylized and seminaturalistic flowers is relatively small, it appears more complex, as it is rendered with seven different colors, a feat of technical virtuosity. The individual motifs are further modeled by juxtaposing cut and uncut (""ciselé"") pile, which reflect light differently.

In Spain it became established in the 16th century in place of the amice (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p.142). The five wounds gushing blood, embroidered on this collar, represent the Five Wounds of Christ, or the stigmata. These wounds were the marks from his crucifixion - one to each hand and each foot where he was nailed to the cross, and one on his right side where he was pierced with a lance. They drew attention to the suffering he experienced on behalf of mankind. It was probably made in a professional embroidery workshop or in a convent where nuns engaged in the making of ecclesiastical vestments.

Collars such as this one are often depicted in paintings of St Lawrence who died before becoming fully ordained as a Catholic priest; the combination of dalmatic and collar indicate his status as a deacon. Such depictions show that the collar fitted high around the neck of the wearer, curving round the neck so that the maximum height was at the back; the rounded front edges tied together by means of cords attached at each end and completed by a large tassle. Often the imagery or decoration on the collar echoed that of the panels on the front, back and sleeves of the dalmatic, although in miniature because of its size. Good examples appear in two paintings of St Lawrence by Francisco de Zurbaran, the first (1636) is a front view in The Hermitage, St Petersburg and the second (1638-9) is a side view in the Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes, Cadiz. The depth of colour of the dalmatic in the first of these paintings suggests it may represent quite closely the original ensemble which this collar would have complemented. Both are illustrated in Jonathan Brown. <i>Zurbaràn</i>. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1991, pp.24 & 100.

During the Counter-reformation in the second half of the sixteenth century and thereafter, the expression of intense emotion was expressed through a variety of religious artefacts, from painting and sculpture to ecclesiastical vestments. The Council of Trent (1545-63) revitalised religious art in order to arouse religious fervour. The imagery on vestments was therefore part of a wider movement in the plastic arts. For example, in Spain, the great power at the forefront of the Counter-reformation and the likely source of this collar, the Holy Week processions which immediately preceded Easter used sculpture of Christ crucified and taken down from the cross to excite emotion in the ordinary people who lined the streets. For much of the year, these sculptures were kept in their own chapels within churches, where they could be venerated. In such pieces, the agony of Crucifixion was evident because the wounds were so realistically depicted on carefully carved representations of human bodies with horrendous gashes of red wounds. The wounds on this collar are an evocative shorthand of this vivid three-dimensional imagery and would have been easily understood by a largely illiterate popular audience. (See for example some of the work of the Castilian sculptor Gregorio Fernandez in Juan Jose Martìn Gonzalez. <i>Escultura Barroca Castellana</i>. Madrid: Fundaciòn Làzaro Galdiano, 1959, p. 155, Fig. 88 Christ on the cross (Valladolid, Iglesia del Carmen); p. 56, Fig. 89 and 90 Cristo yacente (Segovia Cathedral and Valladolid, Museo Nacional de Escultura Policromada, originally from San Neri, Madrid; p. 157 fig. 91, Cristo yacente (Valladolid, Convento de Santa Ana) For Andalusia, see Susan Verdi Webster, <i>Art and Ritual in Golden-Age Spain</i>.

This chasuble is the vestment worn by a Catholic priest when celebrating the Mass. It was - and is - worn over the alb and stole. This style of chasuble became widespread after 1600. Prior to that - at the time from which this embroidery dates - chasubles were circular garments which slipped on over the head.

Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. This fact usually accounts for the dominant imagery being on the back and the construction being more perfect there. This chasuble is probably made from Italian (or Spanish) velvet, cut down from its original bell shape into the fiddle-shape that became popular in the early seventeenth century. The colour suggests this chasuble would have been worn for requiem masses or for Easter. 

The velvet was probably made in Italy or Spain, then the major velvet weaving centres in Europe, and provided an ideal foil for rich embroidery which might be executed at home or abroad.

The wide neckline and short sleeves of the dress are typical of fashionable evening wear of the mid 1820s. Although it retains remnants of the high-waisted, neo-classical shape popular at the beginning of the century, its construction shows the move towards the lower waists and fuller skirts of the 1850s. The use of velvet demonstrates the trend for more sumptuous fabrics after the dominance of cotton and muslin in the previous two decades.

The death of Princess Charlotte, the only child of George IV, in childbirth in 1817 plunged the whole country into mourning and set the high standards for mourning dress of this period. Fabrics such as silk and velvet were too shiny to be worn for the first stages of mourning, however, official mourning guidelines issued by the Lord Chamberlain decreed that black velvets and silks were permissible in the third and final stage.  This dress would have been worn with an evening turban, long gloves and a pelisse cloak, often lined with chinchilla fur. It is likely that it was a gift from William Jardine and was worn when mourning the death of Jane Johnstone's grandmother, Elizabeth Johnstone who died in 1825.","Velvet"

Riding habits were one of the few women’s garments available in a tailored style. Gradually demand grew for stylish, practical and hard-wearing outfits suitable for a wide range of outdoor activities including shopping, travelling and walking. By the 1870s the tailored look for women had really begun to take hold. Cutting systems used on men’s suits were transferred to fashionable skirts and bodices and the resulting styles were rapidly adopted. Fashion magazines and cutting journals trumpeted the superior skill of the tailor whose methods of manipulating cloth captured the full beauty of the female form.

This bodice shows how the tailor has modified his techniques to suit the fashionable silhouette. With special attention to measuring, cutting and making he has moulded the cloth to follow the curves of the bust, hollow of the waist and the prominence of the hips.  The outer cloth was fitted to the figure with the aid of a canvas interlining constructed with darts and seams to give the required contours. Both were skilfully pressed into shape using a variety of irons and a damp rag which was necessary to produce steam.  The rich colour and luxurious velvet decoration heightens the jacket's feminine appeal which is capped by full sleeves in true 1890s style.","Velvet"

Jackal hunting was popular among British soldiers and administrators living in India during the nineteenth century. The rules were based on the British fox hunt although the hunting packs tended to be made up of dogs of different breeds known as ‘Bobbery-Packs’ in Anglo-Indian colloquial terms, and hence the name ‘Bobbery Hunt’.

This light linen coat would have proved ideal for hot climates, replacing the heavy woollen cloth used for British hunts. It was probably worn by the huntsman who looked after the dogs, as the slanting pocket on the front could have held a hunting whistle or horn. The collar is very similar to one worn by the Earl of Darlington for a Yorkshire hunt in 1826: ‘Lady Arabella was attired in her scarlet habit, and his Lordship in a straight-cut scarlet coat, with an embroidered fox on the collar, a hat, and a leather girdle across his shoulder.

The earliest surviving guild regulations are available for Lisbon and date to 1517. Lisbon, the largest city in Portugal and its capital, only had a small number of skilled masters in the sixteenth century: in 1551 about 10, in 1552 about 16 working in eight workshops, and in 1620 about 11. The guild regulations reveal the different levels of examination that led to mastery of the trade, embroiderers having to learn how to prepare different materials and motifs. The simplest task was the making of 'a coat of arms in gold and silks with some kind of motif appropriate to arms', and the most difficult the embroidering of the human figure, in particular, the features of the face, and the use of different qualities of gold thread.  The embroidered motifs on this piece fall between these two extremes of complexity. (Teresa Alarcao & José Alberto Seabra Carvalho, <i>Imagens em Paramentos Bordados. Seculos XIV a XVI</i>. Instituto Português de Museus, 1993, p. 19-20).

No contract for this type of Portuguese embroidery has been found, so the costs of producing such work and the negotiation between client and craftsman are not known.

As a result of Portugal's voyages of discovery from the 15th century onwards, the Portuguese came into contact with designs from different cultures, including China and India. Such taste impacted on Portuguese textiles. The V&A collection has a small but impressive group of Sino-Portuguese and Indo-Portuguese style embroideries (about 120), which date from the 16th to 18th centuries; most are made in multi-coloured silks on cream or white satin grounds, rather than in the rich materials used here. Indeed only three pieces, all from circa 1550-1600 are embroidered velvet. This piece is unusual in combining Chinese and grotesque (Roman) styles, and at the time of its purchase was deemed typical of a particular strain in Portuguese decorative arts.

It should be noted however that Spain also made major voyages of discovery in this period and it is likely that this taste entered the vocabulary of its decorative arts about the same time.","Velvet"

The embroidery is executed in gold couching, with textural effects created through the combination of simple blocks of metallic yarn, basket-work effect in the metallic yarn (basket stitch), and the outlining of the motifs in red silk twisted with silver -gilt and couched with silk. The design repeats itself 3.75 times from right to left. The repeating motif comprises a symmetrical pattern made up of dragon or lion-like motifs with birds (firebirds?) and stylised foliage and flowers on either side of a 'vase' containing a plant. The cut edge of the textile reveals that the raised areas of the pattern were created by couching the gold threads over linen or cotton stuffing. Each lion/dragon originally had an eye made out of a black/blue glass bead (now some are missing). Framing the grotesque pattern is a triple row of cording originally covered in silver yarn (sewn on to the inner edge of the selvedge). On the back of the velvet, only the couching threads in yellow and red are visible. The embroidery may have formed part of the valance of a bed or dais.","Velvet"

It was probably part of a valance that hung round the top or base of a regal bed or the platform on which a monarch or dignitary sat when officiating at a ceremony. It was probably made in Portugal where, as in most of Europe, trade organisations called guilds ruled the production of professional embroidery. 

Craftsmen served an apprenticeship in order to become masters and set up their own workshop. Lisbon had only about ten skilled masters in the 16th century. The guild regulations reveal that trainee embroiderers had to learn how to prepare different materials and motifs. The simplest task was the making of coats of arms in gold and silks, and the most difficult were the embroidering of the human figure and face and the use of different qualities of gold thread. The embroidered motifs on this piece fall between the extremes.

Its soft and luxurious feel, the rich and deepening effect it lent to any colour, and its versatility, made it the chosen fabric of the rich and powerful. The sinuous pattern of roses and entwining branches seen here was a popular one and assumed many variations; roses were associated with the Virgin Mary and Venus and symbolised virtue, love and beauty. This velvet is comparatively light in weight, suggesting that it would have been used for clothing; velvet draped well and greatly enhanced the silhouette of the wearer.","Velvet"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/c2e99452-cdde-3d79-9376-a1b884d59f54","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","Italy was the European centre for the production of velvet during the fifteenth century. From the mid-fourteenth century onwards, velvet weavers belonged to a separate guild from other weavers, and kept their weaving methods closely guarded secrets from their competitors. The weavers' skills and techniques were revered and coveted, and so highly prized that the most specialised of velvet weavers were not permitted to leave their city's walls without permission. If a velvet weaver did take his skills to a rival city, he could expect not just the confiscation of all his assets but to be sentenced to death.

Weaving velvet was an expensive process, requiring three times the amount of silk of that used in other fabrics. The guild dictated that the weaver use the very finest of silk threads- organzine. The textile could then be made more costly still with the addition of silver and gold thread. 

The soft texture and comparatively small pattern of this velvet, combined with its light weight, suggest that it would have been used for clothing. Velvets were well suited to noble dress, not merely because their costliness demanded a certain level of income but because they draped well and enhanced the silhouette of the wearer. This velvet is a good example of the repetitive symmetrical pattern (consisting of a floral motif enclosed in ogee curves) developed and put to wide use during the fifteenth century, which continues to be employed in velvet weaves today.

In Spain it became established in the 16th century in place of the amice (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p.142). This collar has lost the cords ending in impressive tassels that were usually attached to the front in order to tie it in place. The five wounds gushing blood, embroidered on this collar, represent the Five Wounds of Christ, or the stigmata. These wounds were the marks from his crucifixion - one to each hand and each foot where he was nailed to the cross, and one on his right side where he was pierced with a lance. They drew attention to the suffering he experienced on behalf of mankind. It was probably made in a professional embroidery workshop or in a convent where nuns engaged in the making of ecclesiastical vestments.

Collars such as this one are often depicted in paintings of St Lawrence who died before becoming fully ordained as a Catholic priest; the combination of dalmatic and collar indicate his status as a deacon. Such depictions show that the collar fitted high around the neck of the wearer, curving round the neck so that the maximum height was at the back; the rounded front edges tied together by means of cords attached at each end and completed by a large tassle. Often the imagery or decoration on the collar echoed that of the panels on the front, back and sleeves of the dalmatic, although in miniature because of its size. Good examples appear in two paintings of St Lawrence by Francisco de Zurbaran, the first (1636) is a front view in The Hermitage, St Petersburg and the second (1638-9) is a side view in the Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes, Cadiz. The depth of colour of the dalmatic in the first of these paintings suggests it may represent quite closely the original ensemble which this collar would have complemented. Both are illustrated in Jonathan Brown. <i>Zurbaràn</i>. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1991, pp.24 & 100.

During the Counter-reformation in the second half of the sixteenth century and thereafter, the expression of intense emotion was expressed through a variety of religious artefacts, from painting and sculpture to ecclesiastical vestments. The Council of Trent (1545-63) revitalised religious art in order to arouse religious fervour. The imagery on vestments was therefore part of a wider movement in the plastic arts. For example, in Spain, the great power at the forefront of the Counter-reformation and the likely source of this collar, the Holy Week processions which immediately preceded Easter used sculpture of Christ crucified and taken down from the cross to excite emotion in the ordinary people who lined the streets. For much of the year, these sculptures were kept in their own chapels within churches, where they could be venerated. In such pieces, the agony of Crucifixion was evident because the wounds were so realistically depicted on carefully carved representations of human bodies with horrendous gashes of red wounds. The wounds on this collar are an evocative shorthand of this vivid three-dimensional imagery and would have been easily understood by a largely illiterate popular audience. (See for example some of the work of the Castilian sculptor Gregorio Fernandez in Juan Jose Martìn Gonzalez. <i>Escultura Barroca Castellana</i>. Madrid: Fundaciòn Làzaro Galdiano, 1959, p. 155, Fig. 88 Christ on the cross (Valladolid, Iglesia del Carmen); p. 56, Fig. 89 and 90 Cristo yacente (Segovia Cathedral and Valladolid, Museo Nacional de Escultura Policromada, originally from San Neri, Madrid; p. 157 fig. 91, Cristo yacente (Valladolid, Convento de Santa Ana) For Andalusia, see Susan Verdi Webster, <i>Art and Ritual in Golden-Age Spain</i>.

The pattern is outlined in red and yellow silk cord. In the middle (central back of collar when worn) is the cream-coloured oval panel on which the Five Wounds of Christ are embroidered in fawn and red silk; the oval is surrounded by a yellow appliqué frame which leads the eye towards the stylised appliqué leaves in yellow and blue satin on either side of this central motif. There is a layer of stiffening (paper?) between the appliqué and the velvet base. Round each applied satin motif there is sewn fine yellow silk cording. The collar as a whole is trimmed round the edge with a pinkish yellow silk fringe and lined with glazed blue linen, which is tacked on to the front with red running stitches, visible on both sides. The linen is worn with patches of the original natural colour showing through the blue dye. On the back there are signs that cords for tying the collar in place were once attached (by blue thread), as the tension exerted during tying has created circular worn patches. The cords are no longer attached. The red velvet reveals few signs of deterioration, while the creamish satin is cracked both horizontally and vertically and in certain instances has been repaired.  

The Five Wounds are embroidered in two colours suggestive of fresh and drying blood. They are positioned to indicate the wounded parts of Christ's body when he was taken from the cross: the wounds inflicted by the nailing of his hands and feet and the lance wound in his side. This last is the central motif, depicted as a slash. From each wound blood spurts.

There is a small handwritten paper label sewn to the back of the vestment, indicative of its origins. Rectangular in shape, it bears text in pencil and black and red ink.

John Jones, the original owner of this stool and its pair (1031-1882), was a military outfitter, who lived in London and used his wealth to form an extensive collection of French 18th-century decorative art. In 1882 he left the collection to the South Kensington Museum, the forerunner of the V&A. Jones was taken in by some 19th-century fakes, but it is unlikely that he was taken in by these.  More probably, he saw these as useful reproduction pieces that would help to furnish his house in Piccadilly. He had a further pair which were covered in Aubusson tapestry.","Velvet"

To maintain a fire all day demands a certain level of skill - knowing when to add more fuel, when to poke the fire and when to leave it alone - and a range of specialist tools.  Bellows like these were designed to add oxygen to a smouldering fire, encouraging it to burn more fiercely.

The opulent decoration of these bellows is achieved using boulle marquetry, named after its most famous proponent, André Charles Boulle (1642–1732), cabinet-maker to Louis XIV of France, although these bellows were almost certainly made in France between 1860 and 1880. The technique of boulle involves cutting patterns out of a sandwich of layers of brass or pewter and layers of turtle shell, to create both a dark motif with a light background and a light motif with a dark background. The contrast created by using metal and turtle shell is heightened by staining the shell or, as in this case, backing it with a coloured foil (here red). Detail was added to both the metal and the turtle shell by engraving, which was often filled with black or white mastic (though this has rarely survived centuries of wear and polish). These bellows have the same design on both sides, but while the front has a tortoiseshell background with brass motifs, the back has a brass background with tortoiseshell motifs.","Velvet"

By the thirteenth century clerical attire was more or less stabilized throughout the Latin Christian church. According to the <i>Rationale for the Divine Offices</i> of the canonist and liturgist William Durandus (d. 1296), all ranks of the higher clergy were entitled to wear the cope (or <i>pluviale</i>) for processional occasions on feast days. As a result, inventories of monastic churches testify to the existence of a very large number of copes, Canterbury, for example, owning no fewer than sixty copes in 1315. (Dyan Elliot, 'Dressing and Undressing the Clergy',  in E. Jane Burns ed. <i>Medieval Fabrications. Dress, Textiles, Cloth, and Other Cultural Imaginings</i>. London, 2004, pp. 56-58; Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds, 2002, p. 11.)

The cope had developed from the same Roman garment (<i>paenula</i>) as had the chasuble, but by the eleventh century had a different form: it was semi-circular and open down the front; the front opening fastened just below the neck across the chest with a short strip of embroidered material or a morse (a metal clasp); orphrey bands ran the full length of the front opening and on the back, the cope retained a vestigial hood which was triangular or shield-shaped (as in this example). (Johnstone, op.cit.) The cope was so voluminous that its rich materials lent themselves to recycling for other purposes. There are many surviving examples of chasubles and dalmatics made of this kind of silk velvet, but fewer examples of full copes, some of which may have been cut down into other less voluminous vestments. Christa Mayer-Thurman illustrates and describes similar velvet copes or pieces of cope in different liturgical colours (green, purple, blue and red) in <i>European Textiles. The Robert Lehman Collection</i>, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2001, pp. 74-87; Donald King illustrates and describes part of a red velvet cope from Italy or Spain in <i>European Textiles in the Keir Collection 400BC to 1800AD</i>, London, 1990, cat. 49, p. 76.

<i>Iconography</i>. 
The saints depicted in the orphrey bands probably connect the cope to a Cologne church, or at least a church nearby - and their identity is reinforced by the lettering below their image and attributes. Two of them, St Ursula and St Severinus were Cologne saints. Severinus was not very popular elsewhere. St Hubert seems to have been the dedicatee of a military order established by the Archbishops-Elector of Cologne and was frequently represented in the Cologne area. See Conversion and Mass of St Hubert panels in National Gallery (Glyn Davies). The composition of the Death of the Virgin on the hood is likely to relate closely to imagery in paintings of the period. The depiction of the figures suggests that the scene is based on the Apocryphal Gospel, in particular the passage narrating the moment of the Virgin's death, surrounded by eleven of the Apostles (according to that source, St. Thomas was preaching in remote countries and did not return in time). Here there are, however, twelve apostles, John being the youngest and represented as such, beardless. The symbols that are difficult to make out in the embroidery, because of wear, are probably the palm, All Souls Book, censer and candles.

<i>Textile</i>. Silk velvets of this type were woven in centres in Italy and Spain during the fifteenth and sixteenth century. They were often called 'ferronerie' velvets because the effect created is similar to that of ironwork. They ranked among the most expensive luxury textiles of the time.

Dye analysis, carried out at the Institut Royal du Patrimoine Artistique in Brussels in 2007 by Inge Vanden Berghe, identified the red dyestuffs as insect red and tannin (gallnuts), with a trace of red wood. Her conclusion was that the red velvet was dyed with precious red insect dyes: Polish cochineal alone, or a combination of the very expensive kermes with Armenian cochineal. All three dyes sources were in use in Europe in the fifteenth century. According to the study done by Hofenk de Graaf on red dye sources used between 1450  and 1600 (based on TLC analysis), Polish cochineal was often found in Italian silks, whereas often Armenian cochineal or kermes were detected in red fifteenth century silks with a Spanish origin. She also notes that the use of gallnut for silk weighting, in the case of a later dyeing of light colours as scarlet and crimson shades, was most likely in fifteenth century Spain. (Judith H. Hofenk de Graaff. <i>The Colourful past: origins, chemistry and identification of natural dyesfuffs</i>. Abegg-Stiftung and Archetype publications ltd., 2004, esp. pp. 62 and 68).

<i>Embroidery</i> 
The way in which the haloes are worked in a succession of curving rays is evidently characteristic of German embroidery (Johnstone, p. 75), and may be compared with the piece from the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich illustrated in her book as Fig. 86, and with the Bohemian chasuble bought from Bock by this museum in the following year (1375-1864). The application of metal threads in a diaper pattern in the ground is also similar.","Velvet"

The cope developed from a Roman cloak-like garment and was semi-circular, opening down the front. Orphrey bands ran the full length of the front opening. On the back, the cope retained a vestigial hood which was triangular or shield-shaped. 

Some of the saints depicted on the orphrey bands probably connect this cope to a Cologne church, or at least a church nearby. St Ursula and St Severinus were Cologne saints and St Hubert belonged to a military order established by the Archbishops-Elector of Cologne. Their embroidered names identify them.","Velvet"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/1ca8b262-7dc7-365e-9a99-a592bf3d784c","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","Semi-circular garment made up of widths of deep red silk velvet seamed together; a contrasting embroidered orphrey band is stitched along the opening, and a non-functional embroidered hood is attached centre-back at the neck. The velvet is of the type usually described as <i>ferronerie</i>, because the pomegranate pattern is delineated by a fine outline thought to imitate ironwork. Four full widths of velvet and two three-quarter widths make up the garment, the two central widths are intact, the other panels reveal how carefully this costly textile was used as the outer edges that form the circle have been pieced together from a number of small pieces. A deep fringe is attached round the semi-circular side - probably a later addition although such fringes were used in the Middle Ages. The whole of the cope is lined with deep blue linen (in excellent condition) - also pieced together.

<i>The orphrey bands</i> are embroidered with images of saints (see below), in coloured silks (blue, green, red and brown) and gold thread (Cologne work); there is evidence that originally sequins were sewn on to the blue background embroidery: a few sequins have survived on images of St Lucy and St Severinus, and the reddish thread that attached them to these and other parts of the embroidery is visible against the blue in all cases. The faces of the saints are stitched in white, but the features seem to have been drawn on below the surface (possibly a similar technique to that used as in Butler Bowdon cope). There is also evidence of restoration work executed in white thread, couched down, especially on the right hand side (when worn). A fine yellow braid/ribbon is sewn over the edges of the ophreys on both sides. It dates to either the late 19th or early 20th century.

<i>The hood</i> is of couched gold thread, with figures representing the Death of the Virgin Mary and is very worn. The draperies were originally of gold threads, whipped round with fine coloured silks; the heads of the various figures are of canvas embroidered with fine silks in long and short stitches. A narrow red and white fringe is sewn around the hood. It is lined with blue linen, a shade lighter than the lining of the rest of the cope.

<i>Iconography</i>.  The figures depicted on the orphreys are saints who each inhabit a similar space, placed below a castellated wall, under a decorative Gothic arch, they stand on a tesselated floor; below the floor, in Latin, is the inscription bearing the appropriate name. When the cope was on the clergyman's body, the saints faced each other across the opening: from bottom to top, St John the Baptist faced St Hubert, St Ursula faced St Lucy, St Severinus faced St Bernadino and Saint Elizabeth faced St Mary Magdalene. The textiles worn by the saints (as long flowing robes) echo the pattern found on the velvet of the cope - large, abstract pomegranate designs. Each saint carries the appropriate indicator of status and attribute: the bishops Severinus and Hubert wear mitres and carry croziers, those of royal lineage, Ursula and Elizabeth (of Hungary) wear crowns, the martyrs, Ursula and Lucy carry palm fronds. Mary Magdalen is depicted with long flowing tresses, holding a vase of ointment; Elizabeth holding a garment (no doubt an allusion to those she made for those in need). 

The hood shows the death of the Virgin. She lies in a rectilinear bed in a room with a window on the left hand side above the bed. Round the bed are twelve male figures with haloes round their heads. Eleven are bald and bearded, the twelfth is clean-shaven and has a full head of hair. He is holding a jar (?). He and two other saints in the group are behind the bed, looking towards the Virgin; one of them holds a palm branch. To their right is another group whose attention is focussed on an object that looks like an incense burner. In front of the bed side two saints looking at a book, and to their right is another saint with a book who looks as if he is reading to the assembled crowd.  Only the faces, hands and hair of the saints is executed in silk (much worn); the rest of the embroidery (draperies, bed, background) is in different metal threads (the Virgin's robes, sheet and pillow, probably in silver-gilt; the saints'/apostles' garments, bed, bedcover, background) in gold. The metal threads are couched down, the background using a red silk, and creating a geometric diaper pattern. The ground is badly worn, so much of the brownish linen base textile is visible. The haloes are worked in a succession of curving rays, which shows up the gold to great advantage. A shield has been applied centre bottom of the hood; it is divided in half, the left blue with two silver cylinders, the right red with a gold band at the top and two gold chevrons over the red. Round the edge of the hood is a half-inch band of brick stitch embroidery in metal thread, and attached round the outer edge of that band is a narrow braid in red and white (half-inch), ending in a fringe.","Velvet"

The embroidery has been built up from a base of linen, stitched in coloured silk (in three shades of green, of blue and of red), silver, and silver-gilt thread, in couching, and long and short stitch. The ground of the embroidery is executed in different textures and fillings of metallic thread, and some of it is raised work. The pattern on the velvet consists of an interrupted wavy diagonal stem, bearing on one side conventionalised pine-cones, and on the other pomegranates in a circle of leaves. This pattern is seen best on the back of the chasuble as the front has been pieced together. The back is also much less worn than the front, revealing the construction of the embroidery. It is lined in blue linen.

<i>Iconography</i> 
The orphreys depict scenes from the Life of the Virgin, mainly on backgrounds of gold and silver and were originally intended for a cope rather than a chasuble. They have been mutilated when recycled, the lowest compartment of the design cut to suit the length of the chasuble, and two of the remaining compartments used to trim the neckline. They have been unsympathetically used, so that the same scene is at the same level, but cannot be read left to right. Each scene comprises a group of people in an architectural setting, definitely classical in line rather than Gothic.The folds on the clothing of the figures are very carefully delineated.

Round the neck: 
(1) the death of the Virgin, lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles, and 
(2) the Assumption of the Virgin, borne up by angels with St Thomas by the tomb below.

On the back: 
(1) the Anunciation; the Virgin seated, the Angel kneeling, God the Father appearing in the clouds and the Dove descending;

(3) the meeting of St Anna and St Joachim; they embrace before the Golden Gate of Jerusalem, an angel touches their heads and a manservant and maidservant attend them; 
(4) the rejection of St Joachim's offering: he carries away a lamb from the altar behind which three priests are sitting or standing; 
(5) the angel appearing to St Joachim among the shepherds, the lower part is missing. 

On the front orphrey:

Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. The front is more worn than the back because it has rubbed against the altar. The embroidery on the orphrey bands tells the story of the Life of the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus Christ, from the moment the angel announced her forthcoming birth to her mother St Anne, until her journey to heaven after her death.

The silk velvet of the chasuble was probably made in Italy, which boasted the most sophisticated centres of silk manufacturing in Europe in the 15th century. The style of the embroidery on the orphreys is very similar to Florentine paintings of the early to mid-15th century. The shape dates to the 17th century or later. Precious silk and fine embroidery, especially containing metallic threads, were used economically and were often recycled.","Velvet"

The chasuble is an example of the richly decorated vestments commissioned for use in the Church. This particular example is typical of the International Gothic style favoured in the fifteenth centuries, the silk velvet characterised by scrolling motifs consistent with a dating of the late fifteenth century. Such a silk was suitable for both secular and ecclesiastical use, and might have been made in an Italian or Spanish centre (the most developed in Europe at this time). At that period chasubles were conical in shape, rather than fiddle- or violin-shaped, so this garment must have been altered at a later date (after the beginning of the seventeenth century). The silk may even have begun its life as a different form of dress or furnishing altogether, no major distinction between secular and ecclesiastical designs being made at that time. The orphreys may well date to earlier in the century, their composition and treatment being similar to Italian paintings of the 1420-50 period. The dimensions of the compartments of the orphreys may be useful eventually in identifying the geographical location of making (when guild regulations become easily accessible for different cities). Currently, identification can only be speculative, based on the aesthetics of the images. It is possible that these orphrey bands were originally intended/used for a cope. The embroidery was probably executed either in a professional workshop (urban or church) or by nuns. Certain similarities with the needlework image of St Verdiana (Viridiana) (4216-1857) in terms of composition and architectural setting are very evident; it is thought to be Florentine.

<i>Iconography of orphreys</i> 
The Life of the Virgin is told in the embroidered panels on the orphreys in eight vignettes, including the Annunciation and Assumption. Rogers and Tinagli note that from as early as the 2nd century, Mary's virtues of humility, obedience, modesty and silence were extolled in contrast to Eve's negative characteristics, and that in the early fifteenth century such ideas were communicated to a wider audience visually via Fra Angelico's Annunciation scenes, and verbally by preachers such as the Franciscan Bernardino da Siena (e.g. in a 1427 sermon). Devotional activities focussed on different aspects of her life and were encouraged in Italy by both the church and the state, and many groups - not just women - felt drawn to her cult.  Rosika Parker suggests that 'heroic women who transcended in virtue all women and all humans' became a popular theme in Renaissance writing, and that they were increasingly portrayed as meek and domesticated figures. At this time, celebrations of the Assumption of the Virgin were increasingly embroidered on ecclesiastical vestments , complementing her image as Mary the mother. In this representation, the architectural sets and the scenes with her parents undoubtedly stress her humanity as well as the importance of her role as the mother of Jesus Christ.

Lady Fairhaven kept several spectacular outfits bought in Paris and New York for her sister and herself in the 1880s and 1890s. These surviving garments give us an insight into the sisters' taste, and the range of dressmakers they patronised. Many of these dressmakers emulated the work of the House of Worth, which produced the most luxurious gowns created from bold French silks, combined with ingenious design touches in embroidery, lace and chiffon. The contrasting black and ivory textiles of this ensemble create a dramatic effect, while this is softened by the delicacy of the lace, and the rows of narrow ribbons encased in chiffon.","Velvet"

The waistcoat fronts and back skirts are made of the silk velvet, the backs of beige wool broacloth.  The neckline is round and bound with a narrow strip of velvet.  The fronts curve from waist to hem with wide skirts below the hem, reaching to mid-thigh.  There is a scalloped pocket flap on each waistcoat front at hip level.

In the hierarchy of silk products, it was one of the richest because the technique of velvet weaving required skilled weavers (often specialised in this particular technique) and the making of the velvet took a long time (under optimal circumstances, a weaver could progress at the rate of no more than 200 feet in a year). This velvet is particularly complex because it comprises different forms of pile and incorporates metallic threads. It conforms to the usual widths of the period for such textiles (54-60 centimetres).

In Western Europe, expertise in velvet-weaving was restricted at this period to various Italian cities (e.g. Lucca, Florence, Genoa, Venice) and to certain centres in Spain, some of which had gained their knowledge through the import of Italian craftsmen (e.g. Valencia). The first records of velvet production in Lucca, Venice, Florence, and Genoa date to the beginning of the fourteenth century, as do the first records of their presence in royal and papal inventories. While Lucca was the earliest centre, the other three cities competed for leadership in the fifteenth and sixteenth century. 

Not surprisingly, velvet weavers earned more than their confreres who specialised in other silk textiles, and their earnings increased in direct proportion to the difficulty of the work involved: in the velvet hierarchy, at the bottom sat the weavers of solid velvets, at the top the weavers of pile-on-pile velvets with brocading and bouclé gold wefts. The former earned about one third of the wages of the latter.

In the sixteenth century sumptuary laws attempted - unsuccessfully - to reduce excessive expenditure on clothing and furnishings, restricting the use of such textiles in dress and forbidding it in canopies, blankets, curtains, and cushions.

In the hierarchy of silk products, it was one of the richest because the technique of velvet weaving required skilled weavers (often specialised in this particular technique) and the making of the velvet took a long time (under optimal circumstances, a weaver could progress at the rate of no more than 200 feet in a year). This velvet is particularly complex because it comprises different forms of pile and incorporates metallic threads. It conforms to the usual widths of the period for such textiles (54-60 centimetres).

In Western Europe, expertise in velvet-weaving was restricted at this period to various Italian cities (e.g. Lucca, Florence, Genoa, Venice) and to certain centres in Spain, some of which had gained their knowledge through the import of Italian craftsmen (e.g. Valencia). The first records of velvet production in Lucca, Venice, Florence, and Genoa date to the beginning of the fourteenth century, as do the first records of their presence in royal and papal inventories. While Lucca was the earliest centre, the other three cities competed for leadership in the fifteenth and sixteenth century. 

Not surprisingly, velvet weavers earned more than their confreres who specialised in other silk textiles, and their earnings increased in direct proportion to the difficulty of the work involved: in the velvet hierarchy, at the bottom sat the weavers of solid velvets, at the top the weavers of pile-on-pile velvets with brocading and bouclé gold wefts. The former earned about one third of the wages of the latter.

In the sixteenth century sumptuary laws attempted - unsuccessfully - to reduce excessive expenditure on clothing and furnishings, restricting the use of such textiles in dress and forbidding it in canopies, blankets, curtains, and cushions.

The motifs at the top of the sampler relate to their family crests. The sampler is from a period of transition in the practical use of such items - between the 16th century and earlier, when they served as a reference piece for a more or less experienced embroiderer, and what gradually became their nature in the 17th century: a method of measuring and recording the maker's skill.

1931 Description: cover, coloured silks on brown cotton; satin and double running stitches. The cover is in two pieces, stitched together across the centre.  At either end is a broad band of embroidery in crimson and blue-green silks, the pattern consisting of symmetrically arranged conventional flowers and leaves.  Above this band at either end are three turkeys, seen from the front, in the same colours, and above these two butterflies; along one side is a narrow crocheted border in the coloured silks, and at either end is a fringe of green silk and cotton.

1975 Description: The ground cloth is a balanced weave and probably is made of the natural brown, undyed, cotton known as Cuyuscate or Ixcaco (Gossypium Mexcianum) so valued and popular in Guatemala among the Indians.  This piece is not typical of Guatemalan Indian work but was probably embroidered by Guatemalans for the Spanish colonists.  Silk embroidery on Cuyuscate is mentioned by Osborne in relation to the village of Totonicapan; perhaps this piece is from there as this was also a colonial centre. See L de J Osborne 'Indian Crafts of Guatemalan and San Salvador' (University of Oklahoma Press, 1965 p.149).  On pp.96-97 there is a reference to the peacock and to green silk and turtle motifs.

Notes (1997): The ground is a loose plain weave with brown (undyed) cotton (Z-spun, unplied).  There are 44 warp threads per inch and 34 weft threads per inch.  Both ends are oversewn with red silk; neither seems to have been turned as a hem but both seem thicker and stronger than the ground.  The embroidery (which is reversible) is worked with red and blue (or blue/green?) floss silk.  The same type and colour of silk has been used to make a narrow bobbin lace edging which has been attached to one side.  Lengths of plaited brown and blue silk (4.5"" long) have been attached to both ends to form a fringe.  The join across the middle of this piece is very crude and gives the impression that the piece was originally a deep border made from two widths joined side by side.","Embroidery"

The professional male embroiderers from the Mochi community in Kutch developed this embroidery technique by using a hook, as well as a needle. This was an adaptation of a method previously used on leather. Embroideries such as this were made for and sold to wealthy Indian patrons. [27/03/2003]
EMBROIDERED SKIRT 

Professional male embroiderers of Kutch’s Mochi community embroidered skirt cloths like this for wealthy patrons. They used a hooked awl (ari) to create its fine chain-stitch, a technique adapted from leatherwork.

The hem would probably also have been given additional weight by a facing of thicker material. The materials, design and technique are all typical of the fine embroidery of Kutch, part of the modern state of Gujarat in north-western India.This type of  chain-stitch embroidery was the speciality of professional male embroiderers from the Mochi community of Kutch in Gujarat. They were originally leather workers and had developed a technique of silk embroidery on leather using a type of hooked awl. This method was later adapted for use on cloth. The Mochi work of Kutch is among the finest embroidery ever produced in India, and was used for textiles at the Mughal court as well as for the wealthy patrons of urban Gujarat.<br><br><b>Design & Designing</b><br>This skirt-piece is embroidered with a repeating floral pattern on a rich yellow ground.

An epitaphios is a large cloth carried in procession in the Good Friday services and for which the early term was Great Aër. The decoration, with the body of the dead Christ accompanied by angels with fans and with the symbols or figures of the evangelists in the corners, is of conventional form. In this example, the verses from the troparion emphasise the Good Friday theme. The dedication also mentions <i>Prayer of the servant of God Nicholas Eudaimonoioannes with his wife and children in the year 6915</i><i> <I>[<i>1407</i>]</I>.</i> The Nicholas mentioned here may well be the Nicholas Eudaimonoioannes who acted as Manuel II's ambassador to the Venetians in 1416 and was one of his delegates to the Council of Constantine in 1414-17. 

The Eudaimonoioannes family held an important place in the history of the Morea (the Peloponnese), as archons of Monemvasia from the 13th century until the Turkish conquest. The epitaphios was probably commissioned for donation to a church in Nicholas' native Morea. It is likely to have been made somewhere in the Greek peninsula but was possibly a product of the capital, Constantinople.","Embroidery"

This specimen is thought to be the only known example of a complete and unaltered tester for a 16th century bed. It has a pattern in yellow satin, cut to shape and applied to the blue satin ground. The design consists of scaffolding of bandwork forming varied shaped compartments, with grimacing masks and human and half-human figures holding music sheets, musical instruments, leafy branches or baskets, or grappling with strange beasts and birds. The detail is embroidered in silk thread. The workmanship is of the highest professional quality and suggests a princely commission.

This bed-head was originally though to be Italian as the grotesque style started there. The term grotesque related to images found principally in Nero's Golden Palace in Rome when it was 'rediscovered' in the 16th century by Italian artists. 'Grotesque' was an adjective derived from 'grotto' and did not relate to the eerie nature of the images. The style became particularly favoured in France, from a comparatively early date, through the influence of Italian artists working in the French court. 

The design of the embroidery seen here is a French variation of the grotesque style, related, for example to the grotesque prints done from 1550 onwards, by Paris engravers Jacques Androuet du Cerceau and Etienne Delaune. Two small fragments of a French embroidered bed valance identical in style to this panel are in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris and must be part of same bed ensemble.","Embroidery"

The borders to the right and left enclose winged putti, storks, ox masks and trophies of war and music.

Throughout, great care has been taken to lend the figures a degree of naturalism; the appliquéd figures' musculature has been defined with embroidery, and different pelts for the beasts are suggested through the use of embroidered spots, fur and down.","Embroidery"

Those shown in this bed head are some of the most favoured: griffons and harpies; animals such as hounds and owls; and anthropomorphs including satyrs, centaurs, sphinx-like figures and phytomorphs.

Elements of these grotesques have been sourced from the engraved works of Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, whose <i>Livre de Grotesques</i> was published in Paris in 1566. The plates were designed to serve as models for artists and craftsmen, du Cerceau directing they should be used  'to awaken their minds and so that each may apply what he finds appropriate to his craft'.(quoted in Brugerolles and Guillet, Paris, 1995, p.58.)

Recent scholarship by Phillipe Morel has encouraged a shift in the traditional art historical reading of the grotesque. Grotesques have long been seen as fantastical and nonsensical products of the artist's imagination, removed from all constraints of a specific iconographical programme. Morel argues that grotesques adhere strictly to antique models and follow a delineated set of principles and rules derived from burlesque literature and other sources, demonstrating an order that would seem at odds with their classification as whimsical caprices. That grotesques proliferated across all forms of the fine and decorative arts during the Renaissance, suggests that their significance has as yet been underestimated and their interpretation in art historical literature still leaves much to be explored. 

Morel also draws attention to the 'wunderkammer' effect produced by Renaissance grotesques, and indeed those depicted in this bed head, with its assortment of curious beasts compartmentalised within the strapwork, are reminiscent of a cabinet of curiosities.(Morel, Flammarion, 1997)

SETTEE
ENGLISH; about 1690
Carved and turned walnut upholstered in cross-stitch needlework trimmed with galloon and fringed.

Bought with the funds of the Bryan Bequest.

The settee came from Hampton Court, Leominster, for which it was probably acquired by Thomas Coningsby, later Earl of Conynsby, an imperious and choleric gentleman of ancient family, who was one of the last of the nobility to employ a bard and jester. [pre October 2000]","Embroidery"

It shows the high standard of French needlework and the sequence of decorating and sewing up these opulent formal garments. A length of cream silk satin has had the outline of a panel drawn onto it, which has then been decorated to shape. When cut out and sewn, it would have formed the left side of the wearer's train. The matching petticoat and bodice of the robe parée would have been embroidered with the same pattern.

The rich labour-intensive work shows 18th century French embroidery at its most complex. The cream satin ground has pink, mauve and green silk appliqué, folded to create the illusion of swagged fabric drapes. Swansdown, coloured metal threads, chenille embroidery, and small beads of padded satin add further detail and texture. The flowers are cut out of velvet and appliquéd, whilst the leaves and peacock feathers are embroidered.","Embroidery"

Adolfo was known for his extravagant patchwork evening looks. Here, he has recycled an antique crazy-patchwork quilt to make the skirt, neck ruff and wrist ruffles. Despite this element of ‘cannibalisation’, he has treated the historic textile with respect, gathering rather than cutting it to make the skirt.

Adolfo Sardiña started out as a milliner in New York in the early 1950s. In 1962, he opened his own salon, designing clothes to accompany his hats. His earliest designs treated each piece as an individual, special item that could be worn separately, or assembled together into a exuberant whole. While the concept was at odds with the principle of co-ordinating, easy-wear separates that distinguished American sportswear design, Adolfo's elaborate clothes proved popular with his wealthy customers. After the 1960s his designs became dramatically simpler and more elegantly restrained.","Embroidery"

In 1955 he won the Coty Fashion award for his designs for Emmé Millinery. In 1962, he opened his own salon and began designing clothes to accompany his hats. He believed that hats should be worn as an accessory rather than a necessity, and carried this over into his clothing designs. His late 1960s fashions treated each piece as an individual and special item by itself, that could be worn together or separately. Although the principle of American sportswear embraces the concept of co-ordinating separates and a relaxed mix-and-match philosophy, the extravagance of Adolfo's designs sat slightly at odds with this philosophy. Even so, his clothes were popular with his wealthy customers.

During the 1960s Adolfo designed cloaks in felt, richly beaded and braided velvet bolero jackets, peasant-looks, and organdy blouses worn under floral overalls, or with extravagant patchwork evening looks (as here). In 1968, he remarked ""Today, one has to dress in bits and pieces—the more the merrier."" By 1969 he described his clothes as being ""for a woman's fun and fantasy moods—I don't think the classic is appealing to people any more.""

In 1970, Adolfo suddenly changed his design approach, abandoning these extravagant designs for knitwear and understatement. He continued designing splendid eveningwear, though practicality was combined with luxury, such as evening sweaters with ballgown skirts, fur-trimmed knits, caftans and evening pyjamas.

Skyros had been under the control of Venice from the mid 15th century, but became Turkish territory in 1538.  The designs of Skyros embrodieries were heavily influenced by the floral style of Turkish ceramics like those from Isnik, and included many birds, ships and human figures, particularly men in Turkish dress, which during the 18th century became the normal male dress in the Aegean Islands.

Their purpose was to provide the inexperienced needlewoman with a practical guide for stitches and motifs while giving her the opportunity to practise them.  Once completed on a long strip of linen the sampler would be rolled up and kept for future reference.

However, during the eighteenth century this practical exercise was combined with another purpose.  As the shape of the sampler changed from a strip to a rectangle so its form changed from what was essentially a practise sheet to a carefully planned pictorial composition arranged symmetrically within a border.  By the time this example was stitched in 1810 this was the standard format.  It was also common to include quotations from religious or literary sources, usually with a moralising overtone.  Some of the subjects depicted in this sampler, such as the stags and insects, can be found in other samplers elsewhere and may have been derived from a common published source or teacher.","Embroidery"

"http://data.silknow.org/object/efa2b102-c985-3e11-b451-39992c03deb3","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","In ‘piecing’ or ‘patchwork’, small pieces of fabric are sewn together to produce a decorative design. The most enduring method in Britain is done by hand, and is known as ‘piecing over paper’. The pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are tacked round each of the shapes, and then joined together from the back using overstitch. The papers are usually removed once the project is complete. Geometric shapes produce some of the most striking examples, such as this cover of squares and triangles. The work is often embellished with appliqué and embroidery to enhance the design. A bedcover that has been pieced but not wadded is often referred to as a coverlet.

This patchwork of fashionable silks was probably made to form part of a larger bed cover or screen, and was hand-pieced over paper. The tacking stitches and paper template are still intact, suggesting that the cover was never finished. Papers still visible in the reverse provide a record of reading habits at the time, including a newspaper from 1705 which records the trial of the notorious plotter, Titus Oates. 

For the embroidery, the maker has taken inspiration from many sources. Several of the silk patches have been stitched with motifs taken from popular prints and books, including Aesop's Fables.","Embroidery"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/efa2b102-c985-3e11-b451-39992c03deb3","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","In eighteenth-century Britain, the bedrooms of the wealthy were used for the display of luxury goods. They were a place where servants entered, family members rested and guests were entertained. Ornamental patchwork bed hangings and quilted bed covers reflected a household's access to a range of fashionable textiles, from colourful imported chintzes to sumptuous silk velvets. Many were bought specially, but householders also recycled textiles from other objects, a common practice given the financial and emotional investment in valuable fabrics.

This patchwork of silks and velvets would have been made as a bedcover or screen. The original design incorporates small embroidered panels, and a wide variety of plain and
patterned silks. A less technically accomplished hand has added figurative embroidery and appliqué to many of the patches after the completion of the piecing. The additional embroidery shows a wide range of popular needlework subjects, including four chinoiserie figures and a scene from Aesop’s fable ‘The Fox and the Vase’. 

No information concerning the provenance of the coverlet was available when it was acquired, but when the later lining was removed for conservation, it revealed an early eighteenth century paper template. Newspaper cuttings relating to the trial of Titus Oates and an advertisement for a proprietary medicine date the template to around 1705. Plain paper has also been used in several areas. Because paper was an expensive consumer item, it was common practice in even the wealthiest households to recycle it. Alongside the range of silks, this suggests an affluent household with access to a range of luxury consumer goods. In 1709 the Female Tatler described the exciting experience of shopping for such goods: ‘The shops are perfect gilded theatres . . . As people glance within their doors, they salute them with – Garden silks, ladies Italian silks, brocades, tissues, cloth of silver or cloth of gold, very fine mantua silks, any right Geneva velvet, English velvet, velvet embossed.’","Embroidery"

Cotton, embroidered with silk floss, metal-wrapped thread and metal-strips
Mughal
Late 18th century
Anonymous loan

An angarkha (from a Sanskrit term meaning ‘body protector’) is a type of robe characterised by an insert panel over the chest. This young man’s angarkha is embroidered with a style of floral motif popular during the late Mughal era. Its floor-length skirt dates it to the late 18th century, when the fashion was for much longer robes than the knee-length of earlier decades. [01/08/2017]

Britain
1875-85

Said to have been worked on a long sea voyage, this appliqué cover depicts an A to Z of scenes, from 'Admiration' to 'Zingari' (an Italian term once used in English to refer to Gypsies). Fashionably dressed men and women engage in the various rituals of courtship. The presence of gaming motifs suggests that the imagery may have been adapted from a card game of the period.

It is made using a piecing technique similar to marquetry, known as 'inlay' or 'intarsia'. Cut-out fabric shapes are inlaid into an identical cut-out space in another fabric (usually a heavy woollen cloth). They are then stitched from the reverse side, using tiny stitches that are not visible on the front. Applique has also been widely used, whereby shaped pieces of fabric are stitched on top of the ground material in order to create the design.

The central panels depict the various rituals and emotions associated with courtship, moving from ‘Admiration’ to ‘Zingari’ (an archaic term for the Romany community). These images are framed by a border that makes reference to an array of cultural figures and symbols, including fairground favourites such as Mr Punch, and gaming card motifs in the four corners. Coupled with the size of the object, these references suggest that it may have been created in relation to a card game. Textiles with playing-card motifs became particularly popular in the 1880s and ’90s. It was also common to associate love and gambling at this time. In George Eliot’s novel Daniel Deronda (1876) games of chance are played both around the gaming table and with the  heart. The gestures of the central figures on the cover also suggest the widespread appeal of melodrama. Prints, plays, novels and the music hall all helped to popularize the form and many of its associated characters.","Embroidery"

The figurative scenes are created from applied and inlaid wool, with embroidered details in silk thread. The border consists of 30 squares of black broadcloth, outlined with thin borders of beige broadcloth. In addition to the love scenes in the centre, the border consists of 30 squares of black felt, containing heads of nineteenth century characters and figures from everyday life, including Punch, clowns, policemen, soldiers and sailors. The four corners contain the four suits from traditional playing cards. The seams of the pieced design have been outlined in a decorative cross-stitch. Lined in blue wool broadcloth.

Sometimes patterns were drawn freehand onto the fabric, but  they were also worked out by counting the threads in the fabric. 

Embroiderers embellished textiles used for church decorations, pillows, valances and hems of dresses using designs drawn from the rich mythology of Ancient Crete and the Minoan, Byzantine, and Italian cultures that have all influenced the history of the island. Typically they feature complex floral designs, mermaids, double-headed eagles, winged snakes, and other animals and birds.

This embroidered border was collected by Thomas Sandwith, British Consul-General in Crete from 1870 to 1885.","Embroidery"

Classically inspired 'sandal shoes', with  square toe and throat, flat sole, rosette and ribbon ankle ties, continued to be worn in black or white for formal wear right up until the 1860s.  However, by the 1850s more elaborate styles were already beginning to emerge and heels came back into fashion.  

This pair of black low-heeled shoes with striking bright blue cutwork, embroidery and tiered grosgrain bow is an example of the fashion for colourful footwear.  It is possible that they were made especially to complement the colours of a particular dress.  The fine cutwork and delicate embroidery are typical of the designs of Julien Mayer, the manufacturer responsible for this pair.  Recognised in the trade for his prowess in shoemaking Mayer advertised his successes on the shoes themselves by stamping the soles with information about the prizes he had won.  This pair is stamped with three small medallions proclaiming the awards he won in London in 1862, Porto in 1865 and Paris in 1867.","Embroidery"

The design motif of bunches of grapes is composed of silver-gilt domed sequins and floss silk, while the heavy borders incorporate actual strips of flattened metal.  The weight of heavy, gold embroidered edgings attached to fine cotton or silk ground fabrics has often meant that fragile courtly garments like this woman's shirt had a short life and were then discarded.  It was common practice in the Indian subcontinent, however, to recycle costly and elaborate edgings on another garment, thereby prolonging their useful lives.  The pristine condition of this shirt suggests that it was never (or very rarely) worn, and it has been preserved in the collections of the Indian Museum and then the V & A since 1855.

The shirt would have been worn over a small bodice (<i>choli</i>) in the same material, and a large, matching veil (<i>odhni</i>) would have been added over the head and shoulders.

CUSHION
About 1600

Rural life was a typical subject for embroideries and tapestries. The embroidery here shows a nobleman hunting with hawks, while gardeners gather fruit and train vines in an orchard. Embroidered cushions made hard seats more comfortable before the development of fixed upholstery in the 17th century.

Long cushion covers like this were specifically made to fit wooden benches. 

It is possible that this cushion was worked in a household rather than a professional workshop. More than one woman or girl might have been involved in making the separate motifs, which were then applied to the silk ground.  These individual motifs were known as slips, like the plant cuttings taken by gardeners. Such household furnishings often depicted scenes from rural life, and as well as the noblemen shown here hunting with hawks, we can also see gardeners at their work, gathering fruit and training vines in an orchard of apples, cherries and quinces.","Embroidery"

Cotton embroidered with silk
Gujarat, for the western market
Early 18th century

Trade embroideries were luxury textiles designed to appeal to the tastes of consumers abroad. Merging elements of both European and Indian aesthetics, Indian trade embroideries for Britain were imported from the 17th to the 19th century and used in both furnishings and dress. This fabric’s design mimics heavy English crewel work, but the extremely fine silk chain-stitching is characteristic of Gujarat. [01/08/2017]","Embroidery"

This dupatta, a woman’s shawl or head-cover, is woven from an extremely fragile combination of silk and strips of gilded silver. The women of the court of Hyderabad, a kingdom of legendary wealth, developed distinct styles of draping richly ornamented fabrics over kurta (tops) and paijama (trousers). Some of these styles are still in use in the region today. [01/08/2017]

Indian formal wear often has glittering metallic decoration sewn on to it. Much rarer are pieces like this with strips of silver and gilded silver actually woven into the fabric. Though further embellished with coloured metal foil (imitating jewels and beetles' wing-cases), the cloth remains flexible enough to be draped over the head or shoulders.

As the print was published in black and white,  the embroiderer was free to choose her colours and stitches, and so demonstrate both her taste and skill.

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when hunting for sport was an important aspect of court and aristocratic life and had a significant role in the power play between rulers and subjects, falconry was considered among the highest status of all hunting pursuits. 

Hoods were used both as an aid to training the birds and to keep the trained falcons quiet and still while sitting on the falconer's glove. Most hoods have a plume on top of the crown which, as well as being decorative, can be used as a handle to help in the removal of the closely-fitting hood. The equipment used for hunting provided an opportunity for extravagant display, and this example is no exception, the leather embellished with gold tooling, silk velvet and highly skilled embroidery in silver thread.","Embroidery"

In 1970 Jean-Paul Asselberghers, curator at the Musées royaux d'art et d'histoire in Brussels, presented the most recent interpretation of this and kindred panels. He suggested that this panel is one of four made for the Order of Vallombrosa. The others are in the Musée royaux d'Art et d'Histoire in Brussels and the Musée Cluny in Paris. All four panels match each other in size (to within two or three centimetres), in the disposition of nail holes round their edges, and in their embroidery technique and colours (although Asselberghers only actually studied firsthand the pieces in London and Brussels). Originally, in the late 19th century, the subjectmatter had been identified as two pairs: two panels of St Verdiana and two of St Dominic. He re-identified the saints, suggesting that each scene related to an incident in the life of a different saint revered by the Vallombrosans.

<b>Subjectmatter</b> 
Asselberghers identifies the scenes as: the death of Saint Verdiana (London); the funeral of St Umilita (Humility) Negosanti, foundress and abbess of  the convent of Saint John the Evangelist in Florence (now in Brussels); the blessed Pierre Igné successfully surviving trial by fire in 1067 in the presence of Saint John Gualberto (who had founded in 1055 a community in Vallombrosa which followed an adaptation of the Rule of St Benedict) (now in Paris); and St Arialde siezed by the order of the Archbishop of Milan (Paris). All four saints were venerated by the Vallombrosans. Indeed, St Arailde was canonised in 1075, the year following his death. On her death in 1310 St Umilita's corpse was laid out for several days so that the people could pay their respects, such was her popularity - hence the iconography of this panel which can be compared to a painted panel of the death of this saint which was part of a retable consecrated to scenes of the life of the saint, painted by Pietro Lorenzetti for the church of the Vallombrosan monastery of San Salvi in Florence in 1341 and now in the Musée des Offices (For further information, on St Umilita. St Verdiana were the only female saints venerated by the Vallombrosans. 

<b>St Verdiana</b> 
Born in Castelfiorentino in Tuscany in 1182, Verdiana or Viridiana Attavanti died in 1242 and was canonised in 1553, her feast day being February 1st. She made the pilgrimage to Santiago to Compostela before being walled up as a hermit in her native town in a cell adjoining the chapel of St Anthony, with two snakes as company. She lived in her cell for 34 years under the obedience of the Vallumbrosan abbey. The Franciscans claim her as a tertiary (i.e. a lay member of their order). Many miracles are ascribed to her; she is called upon in the litany of the Sick to intercede against snake bites. (D. Attwater. 1983. <i>The Penguin Dictionary of Saints</i>, 2nd ed. revised and updated by C.R. John, New York; www.catholicculture.org/lit/prayers Litany by Benjamin Francis Musser OFM  (Trinity Communications, 2006) [accessed January 2006]). 

<b>Function</b> 
Asselberhgers considers that stylistically the embroideries date to the first half of the 15th century (Examination of the dress depicted would suggest the same). He also suggests that the panels were probably most appropriate for use in an antependium on which three horizontal rows of two or three panels flanked a large central panel. He cites the antependium in the collegiate church of Manresa, Catalonia as an example of this type, embroidered in the 14th century.  He does not believe they are the right size for dalmatic panels.  

<b>Embroidery in 15th-century Italy</b> 
Embroidery was both a professional craft and a woman's accomplishment by the early 15th century, the quality and content of the needlework revealing the skill of the author. The identity of the author of the image is usually unknown although some well-known painters, such as Botticelli, made designs for embroidery. Like painting, embroideries could be narrative as well as decorative, the subjectmatter religious or secular. In this particular instance, the content of the embroidery suggests a devotional and didactic function. A focus for prayer, such images could act as behavioural models for their owners, and were usually kept in the more personal and private rooms in the houses of a wealthy family. (Paola Tinagli. <i>Women in Italian Renaissance Art. Gender, Representation and Identity</i>. Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1997, Chapter 5 'The Cult of Female Saints: Images of Devotion and <i>Exempla</i>) It is therefore possible that this embroidery belonged to a woman who considered St Verdiana an appropriate role model because of her saintly behaviour if it was not a section of a larger embroidered piece for an altar frontal or an apparel for a dalmatic.  The existence of three other comparable panels suggests that that the altar frontal hypothesis may be most appropriate, though at a later date it could have been used as an inidivual image.

<b>St Verdiana in literature, art and film and Tuscany</b> 
Saint Verdiana is mentioned in Bocaccio, <i>DeCameron</i>, Day 5, Story 10.
She appears in Giovanni del Ponte’s Ascension of St John the Evangelist with saints, circa 1410-20 (National Gallery, London) in the habit of a Franciscan tertiary (?) holding a snake in each hand. The painting is inscribed, identifying the saints and she is at the bottom of the left pilaster. A good comparison with this imagery is that in Fra Angelico's Perugia tryptich from the predella of  the death of St Nicholas, on the left hand side of the bier (See Martin Davies, <i>Early Italian Schools</i>, 1986, p. 248). 

On his return to Spain from exile in 1960, Luis Buñuel made a Palme d’Or winning film, entitled Viridiana and based loosely on a nun who experiences a series of mortifications.

A Museum devoted to St Verdiana has recently opened in Castelfiorentino, near the Sanctuary of Santa Verdiana. It contains works of art by Taddeo Gaddi, Jacopo del Casentino, Francesco Granacci, the Maestro delle Effigi Domenicane, Benedetto da Maiano, Bernardo di Stefano Rosselli among others, as well as illumintated codices, wooden statues, terracottas, historic dress, liturgical and precious objects and reliquaries.

<b>Additional information on other panels</b> 
The Catholic Encyclopedia:[accessed May 2009] states:
'St. Umiltà is usually regarded as the foundress of the Vallumbrosan Nuns. She was born at Faenza about 1226, was married, but with the consent of her husband, who became a monk, entered a monastery of canonesses and afterwards became an anchoress in a cell attached to the Vallumbrosan church of Faenza, where she lived for twelve years. At the request of the abbot-general she then founded a monastery outside Faenza and became its abbess. In 1282 she founded a second convent at Florence, where she died in 1310. She left a number of mystical writings. In 1524 the nuns obtained the Abbey of S. Salvi, Florence. There are still Vallumbrosan nunneries at Faenza and S. Gimignano, besides two at Florence. The relics of Bl. Umiltà and her disciple Bl. Margherita are venerated at the convent of Spirito Santo at Varlungo. The habit is similar to that of the Benedictine Nuns.'","Embroidery"

It is worked in fine multi-coloured silks and gold thread in split stitch on a linen or linen and cotton ground. The gold threads are worn but originally the background would have been shiny and bright. The high quality of the stitching indicates that the maker was a skilled craftsperson, either trained in a guild or in a convent. It is likely that the image was made for a space that was devoted to meditation or prayer. The maker and user may have been the same person. The similarity to religious paintings of this period in terms of colour and imagery should be noted. 

The subject matter suggests that the embroidery was made in Tuscany; this saint is not well known outside Italy. St Verdiana (or Viridiana) led a holy life and may have served as a model for girls in whom modesty and religiosity were encouraged. She made a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela (Spain) before living the rest of her life as a hermit. Many miracles are ascribed to her, and in particular her name is invoked as protection against snake bites. Note the snakes that writhe in front of her. The official cult of this saint is recorded from 1553 when she was canonised. She does however appear in religious images before that date.","Embroidery"

The gold thread is very worn which masks the fact that it would originally have formed a very large proportion of the background, different stitches showing different features.

The picture depicts a scene from the Legend of St Verdiana (Viridiana) Attavanti, recluse and patron saint of Castlefiorentino in Tuscany, northern Italy. To the sound of bells miraculously rung, a group of people enter the saint's cell to find her kneeling dead, while her soul is borne aloft by angels; the snakes whose company she adopted for mortification lie entwined before her. The scene is set in a chamber in which the saint is kneeling at her prayers before a picture; on the walls is a floral pattern. On the left hand side, behind her a group of seven men watch her from beside a belfry, in which two bells swing. Five of the men are tonsured (a sign that they were members of the secular clergy) and the one at the front of the group wears a dalmatic which was originally silver (in or nué technique). Their gestures are of amazement and reverence: the man at the front has his hands raised, palm forward. One figure, whose head alone is visible, holds his hand to his head. Two wear capuccio or chaperons, hoods typical of early 15th-century Tuscany, and long gowns (one with matching sleeves, the other a lucco with slits through which the sleeves of a contrasting undergarment are visible). Their length is indicative of their high status, as short version of the lucco could also be worn. In the centre of the room, above the latticed window, two angels are raising the saint heavenwards. On the left, arms outstretched, a nimbus round her head, St Verdiana kneels before an altar, in front of which writhe two snakes.","Embroidery"

These two pieces of silk embroidery on linen represent a pair of unfinished pockets. They show that the embroidery was done first, before cutting out and sewing up. The lack of space for an opening in the embroidery indicates that these were probably intended to be the backs of a pair of pockets. This is somewhat unusual, as most pocket backs were left plain.
The abstract squiggly pattern is called ‘vermicelli’, which is Italian for ‘little worms’. This design is also found on early 18th century bedcovers and quilts, particularly worked in yellow silk. The choice of colour imitates imported Indian embroideries, which preferred the natural yellow shade of tussar silk found in Bengal.

He also designed vestments, banners and windows for churches all over the world. It has been claimed that he was the greatest church furnisher since Wren, and Sir John Betjeman said of him that: ‘his ecclesiastical tastes are rococo; he is perfectly satisfied so long as gold leaf is heaped on everywhere’. Despite this critique, he did work firmly within the Arts & Crafts principle that functionality was paramount. Comper died on 22 December 1960. His ashes were buried beneath the windows he designed in Westminster Abbey, where he had been responsible also for the Warriors’ chapel.

The silk for this cope was designed by Sir Ninian Comper and woven by Perkins and Sons Ltd. The red silk was called ‘Cathedral Damask’, the green silk ‘Kensington’.","Embroidery"

E.214-1994), attributed to Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger (1561-1636) and displayed alongside it.  Waistcoats were long-sleeved upper garments, opening down the front and fitted at the waist using inserted gores.  They were often made of linen and splendidly decorated as in this example.<br><br><b>Ownership & Use</b><br>Margaret Laton or Margaret Layton – What's in a name? When the V&A acquired the jacket and portrait of Margaret Layton in 1994, we used the version ‘Laton’ following the example set in 1933 by V&A curator Albert Kendrick. However, according to documents and monuments of the Layton family in Rawdon, Yorkshire, and the Dictionary of National Biography, the name was always spelled with a ‘y’. We are now making corrections in V&A labels, brochures, publications and on the V&A website.

In the portrait, Margaret Layton wears the waistcoat with an Italian needlelace collar and cuffs, a black velvet gown, a red silk petticoat and a whitework apron. As with many women of this period, we know very little about her life, other than her recorded connections to her father and husband.<br><br><b>Materials & Making</b><br>The waistcoat has long, tight sleeves, narrow shoulder wings, semi-circular cuffs and a small curved collar at the back neck, dating it to about 1610. Made of linen, it is hand sewn and lined with coral silk taffeta. Originally the jacket was fastened with pink silk ribbons. In the 1620s, an edging of spangled silver-gilt bobbin lace was added.  Fragments remain of the original silk ribbons used for fastening. The waistcoat is embroidered in detached buttonhole, stem, plaited braid, chain, couching and dot stitches, with knots and speckling, with coloured silk threads, silver-gilt threads and spangles. <br><br> <b>Time</b><br>Although the waistcoat was made about 1610, the portrait was painted more than 10 years later.  By this time, waistlines had risen.  Margaret Layton adapted to the new style by raising her petticoat and covering the lower half of the waistcoat.","Embroidery"

It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances

Small parasols such as this example were designed for open carriage rides which were hugely popular in the middle of the nineteenth century. A folding hinge, held upright by a sliding metal tube when open, meant the parasol could be reduced to half its size when not in use. Carriage parasols were often elaborate in design as their small size meant manufacturers could display their very best in labour and materials. They were also key in the display of wealth and taste, the very possession of one implying ownership of a carriage. This is a typical example of the 1850s, with a thin carved ivory stick and embroidered cover which had become common place, The Ladies Cabinet reporting in 1850 'There is a profusion of embroideries on all materials this year.'","Embroidery"

Bed valances
1580–1600

Sets of bed hangings created an enclosed, private space within the bedrooms of palaces and grand houses. They were a focal point for luxurious decoration. The horizontal form of valances suited narratives that continued around the bed. These four valances show scenes of courtly life and stories from classical literature.

BED VALANCES
1580-1600

Valances were borders around the top of an Elizabethan bed. Their horizontal form created a frieze for narratives that were embroidered or woven. This pair shows two scenes from the myth of Adonis. One features his conception, resulting from the incestuous affair between Myrrah and Cinyras. The other shows his death while hunting.

They formed a frieze that was particularly suitable for embroidery with figure subjects, often featuring a narrative to provide interest and entertainment. Sets of bed hangings also created a draught-free and private sleeping compartment. 

The style and workmanship of these valances suggests that they were made in a professional workshop either in France itself or under strong French influence. Both show scenes from the Metamorphoses by the Latin poet Ovid : the death of Adonis, and the transformation of Myrrha.","Embroidery"

"http://data.silknow.org/object/f8dac266-4053-3933-9833-08aa2958dc50","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","Saint Veronica is an important and popular figure in Catholicism, despite the fact she does not appear in any of the four canonical gospels. She later became known as the pious woman who pitied Jesus as he bore the cross to Golgotha, and so soothed him by wiping his face with a napkin, or her veil. The image of his face is said to have become miraculously imprinted upon the cloth. The Sudarium, or Veil of Veronica, as it came to be known, became one of the most important relics in the Catholic world. Today, there are at least six relics which claim to be the veil of St. Veronica.

The burse is an important liturgical textile, and is a sort of pouch used to store the corporal, a square white linen cloth which lays beneath the chalice and paten during Mass. Whereas the corporal cannot be richly decorated, there are no such rules regarding the burse. The deployment of this particular saintly figure as a decorative motif is not uncommon. St. Veronica's supposed personal modesty and compassion held obvious appeal for the church, and the tantalising notion of a relic which was not just attributed to Christ, but which also showed an image of his face, is appropriate given that Mass itself provides contact with the body of Christ.

Rich textiles such as this were a very visible method of promoting the glory of Christ, and could be equally beneficial to the patrons whose money was spent in their commission or purchase.","Embroidery"

These fragments of floral dress fabric came from the textile stores of the Nizams of Hyderabad. The first Nizam was the Mughal governor of Hyderabad, and Mughal styles heavily influenced Hyderabad’s court culture. The Nizams ruled Hyderabad independently from 1724 to 1948. In that time they amassed one of the richest textile collections in the world.

Particularly intriguing is the repeat stylized plant motif. The forms used to define it are used in both imperial eagle and goddess motifs, and could in fact be a merging of these two designs. This is a good example of how a culture's design vocabulary is filtered and changed throughout generations.","Embroidery"

The view from the house is delightful.— Harry Peckham, A Tour through Holland . . .and Part of FranceLouis XVI purchased the country residence of the duc d’Orléans a few miles west of Paris for Marie-Antoinette in 1785. Being in need of renovation, the palace was enlarged and altered for the queen, and many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené. A member of an important dynasty of Parisian chairmakers, Sené had been appointed menuisier to the Crown in 1784.A detailed 1788 description of this set, which also included four matching armchairs and a stool, indicates that the pieces were intended for one of Marie-Antoinette’s private rooms at Saint-Cloud, her Cabinet Particulier. The frame of the daybed, originally longer but shortened at a later date, is embellished with carving of ivy on the seat rail and garlands of roses along the crest rail. Ionic capitals surmount the short legs, and most remarkable of all are the Egyptian female half-figures on tapering supports that decorate the front stiles. Even though in his bill Sené called them simply caryatids, these figures clearly express the queen’s taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art, well before Napoléon’s North African campaign made it fashionable. Similar ornament is found on the bergère (a comfortable armchair upholstered between the arms and the seat ), which, in addition, has a medallion on top with Marie-Antoinette’s initials framed by myrtle branches and roses. The matching screen, however, displays classical female figures on its feet and top rail. Unfortunately, the identity of the sculptor is not known, but Louis-François Chatard is documented as having painted and gilded the wooden surfaces.The 1789 inventory of Saint-Cloud records the entire suite in the queen’s Cabinet de Toilette, or dressing room. Listed by its show covers, as was customary for seat furniture, the set is described as being upholstered in white cotton twill, embroidered with a small floral ornament in silk. Known to have worked on needlepoint projects all her life, Marie-Antoinette did the embroidery herself, which she executed in satin stitch. Modern replicas of the queen’s handiwork, including her interlaced monogram on the panel of the fire screen, grace the frames of the furniture today. The colorful floral embroidery on the light cotton ground conveys a sense of summer, the season Marie-Antoinette preferred to spend at Saint-Cloud.Epigraph. Peckham 1788, p. 199.","Embroidery"

The château, situated on a hillside overlooking the Seine not far from Paris, became the queen's favorite summer residence. Built in the sixteenth century and rebuilt during the seventeenth, the palacewas in need of renovation. The architect Richard Mique (1728-1794) enlarged and altered it, and appropriate furnishings were ordered for the queen's apartment.Many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sene (1748-1803), a member of an important dynasty of Parisian chair makers who received a royal appointment in 1784. Sene provided a set of seat furniture for the queen's dressing room, called her cabinet particulier ox cabinet de toilette that is described in the 1789 inventory of Saint Cloud. The daybed, the bergère (a comfortable chair upholstered between the arms and the seat), and the fire screen from the set are now in the Museum's collections (figs. 50?57). They were the gift of Ann Payne Blumenthal, the second wife of George Blumenthal. The painted and gilt frame of the low daybed (fig. 50) is embellished with floral motifs. Six short tapering and fluted legs surmounted by Ionic capitals support the piece. The front stiles of the head- and footboard, which are of equal height, are carved with female half-figures wearing Egyptian headdresses (fig. 51). The berg?re (fig. 52), which has a medallion with Marie Antoinette's initials on its top rail (fig. 53), is decorated in a similar manner. A decade before Napoleon's North African campaign was to inspire the fashion known as égyptomanie, the queen appears to have had a taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art. Seated classical female figures, rather than Egyptian caryatids, decorate the feet of the fire screen (figs. 54, 55), and a woman who once held a cornucopia reclines on its top. The carver is not known, but Louis-François Chatard (ca. 1749-1819) was responsible for painting and gilding the frames.According to the 1789 inventory the set was originally upholstered in a white-twilledcotton with rows of individual flowers embroidered by the queen herself. When the three pieces came to the Museum in 1941 only the fire screen's show cover (fig. 56)had survived. Although the cotton ground is much discolored, Marie Antoinette'sinterlaced initials, composed of blossoms embroidered in satin stitch, are in remarkably good condition (see fig. 57).","Embroidery"

The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers.

"http://data.silknow.org/object/2396a9e8-a19e-3581-bb13-acef93530a81","http://data.silknow.org/graph/met","On 31 October 1947 Duveen Brothers sold what the firm called ""The Marie Antoinette Set"" for 180,000 dollars to Samuel H. Kress (1863-1955). [1] It consisted of three embroidered wall hangings and various pieces of matched seat furniture that originally belonged to two different eighteenth-century suites, with the addition of several later pieces. [2] The wall hangings-chain-stitched embroideries in silk on a white silk-satin ground-show musical instruments, birds' nests, baskets of flowers, and sun hats linked together with swags of flowers. The present armchair and an identical example, as well as a pair of side chairs of the same design, have eighteenth-century show covers that were made to match these embroideries. In order to give the group of seat furniture a unified appearance, the remaining pieces were upholstered with portions cut from additional embroidered hangings that were sacrificed for this purpose.It is not entirely clear how such an illustrious provenance became attached to this assembled lot. When the settee, which dates to the nineteenth century, was published in 1927, nothing was said about its origin except, erroneously, that the eighteenth-century menuisier Georges Jacob had signed it. [3 In 1934, however, the author of a book on French furniture stated that the set had been made by Jacob for Marie Antoinette (1755-1793), and described it as ""one of the most beautiful examples of the talent of this master."" [4] Furthermore, he declared that the embroidery was the work of the queen and her ladies and that Marie Antoinette gave the entire set to Louis-Jean-Marie de Bourbon, duc de Penthièvre (1725-1793). [5]Stamped by Georges Jacob, who supplied much furniture to the court of Louis XVI (1754-1793), this armchair and its pair have straight, rectangular backs, which characterize them as fauteuils à la reine. When cutting the walnut frames, Jacob must have carefully taken into consideration the planned decoration, leaving enough wood to allow the unidentified but obviously very skilled carver to execute the designs. Particularly striking are the deeply undercut garlands of myrtle branches spiraling around a straight rod on the seat and back rails. Trails of berried myrtle branches are carved around the tapering shafts of the cylindrical legs, which are crowned by collars of laurel leaves and berries. Laurel leaves are also repeated on the front of the curving arm supports that terminate in acanthus-leaf volutes. A molding of pearls and twisted-rope motifs carved along the top of the seat rail gives a rhythmical effect not unlike that created by brass upholstery nails-here absent because the chairs are covered à châssis. The original slip seat and webbing have been preserved. The back panel, edge roll, arm pads, and comfortable down and feather seat cushion are all covered in the original late-eighteenth-century embroidered silk-satin. [6] The back displays floral branches framed by scrolling floral borders. The seat cushion shows a basket of flowers within similar borders. Certain motifs, such as the band of pearls along the fore edge of the seat as well as along the borders of the cushion and of the back, clearly relate to the carving of the wooden frame. The high quality of the once very colorful chain-stitched embroidery clearly identifies it as professional work rather than as the fruit of the queen's pastime. The elegant floral compositions are close to designs by the famed silk manufacturer Philippe de Lasalle (1723-1804/5).From a series of marks, inscriptions, and inventory numbers on the frames of both armchairs a considerable amount of information can be gleaned. [7] First of all, the incised roman numerals VII and VIII indicate that they were numbers seven and eight of a suite that included both arm- and side chairs, and possibly one or more settees. It was not unusual for a chairmaker to identify the various elements, especially such removable parts as slip seats and arm pads, as belonging to a certain chair, to avoid mixing them up.The French inscription ""de P[enthiè]vre Paris Chambre à Balus[tre]"" (and a variation of this) is enlightening as well, showing that the chairs were in the possession of the wealthy duc de Penthièvre, grand admiral of France and a cousin of Louis XVI. The set furnished his Paris residence, the Hôtel de Toulouse, an early-seventeenth-century building on the rue de la Vrillière, near the place des Victoires. By 1719 the architect Robert de Cotte (1656-1735) had renovated the mansion for the duc de Penthièvre's father, the comte de Toulouse.[8] The hôtel had, according to a late-eighteenth-century description, a chambre des balustres, or room with balustrade on the ground floor. [9] Used only on special occasions, this room was a chambre de parade, or ceremonial bedchamber. A curving balustrade, or estrade, seen in a plan by Jacques-François Blondel (1705-1774), closed off a bed alcove separating the state bed from the rest of the room . [10] To have such a balustrade was a privilege, allowed only in the state apartments of dukes, princes, and grands seigneurs. [11] The formal nature of the Museum's armchairs as so-called fauteuils meublants, placed along the wall and considered to be part of the interior decoration, reflects the official function of the room. Given the various other French inscriptions on the frames, it is possible that the chairs were also used in a different part of the house. It has been suggested that the entire set was placed in the first-floor apartment of the duke's widowed daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse-Louise, princesse de Lamballe (1749-1792), a friend of Marie Antoinette's. [12]After the duc de Penthièvre's death his only surviving daughter, Louise-Marie-Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre (1753-1821), inherited his possessions. Married to the liberal Louis-Philippe-Joseph, duc d'Orléans (1747-1793), who renounced his title and became known as Philippe-Égalité, she was widowed when he was guillotined during the Reign of Terror in 1793. She was exiled from France, and her property including the Hôtel de Penthièvre (Toulouse) was confiscated in 1797. The chairs may then have come into the possession of the banker Gabriel-Julien Ouvrard (1770-1846), whose name is written on stickers affixed to the slip seats. Having amassed a huge fortune in war speculations, Ouvrard became purveyor to the French navy in 1798. He apparently acquired several of the confiscated estates of the Orléans family that were, however, returned to them in 1814. The ""B125"" marks on the chairs probably refer to one of these properties, perhaps the eighteenth-century Château de Bizy, in Normandy, where the duc de Penthièvre died and his daughter lived after her return from exile. An inventory of the Château de Bizy described the Salon de Famille as furnished with hangings of white silk-satin embroidered with floral designs, and it listed a large set of seat furniture in the same room that was upholstered to match. This inventory was drawn up shortly after 1830, when the castle was in the possession of the son of Philippe-Égalité, Louis-Philippe (1773-1850), duc d'Orléans, who became king of France in 1830.The crowned, interlaced monogram ""LPO"" on the chairs clearly refers to his ownership, and he may have been responsible for uniting the two sets. It has been said that Louis-Philippe left the assembled seat furniture to his youngest daughter, Marie-Clémentine (1817-1907), who lived in Austria after her marriage to Prince Augustus of Saxe-Coburg. [13] Some years after her death, in September 1913, Duveen Brothers, the well-known antiques dealership with branches in London, Paris, and New York, acquired this set of furniture. [14]Notes:1 Duveen Brothers Records 1876-1981, Papers and Correspondence, 1901-81, box 475, f. 5 (microfilm, reel 330).2. In 1958 the pieces were a gift of the Samuel H. Kress Foundation to the Museum. They included two armchairs (acc. nos. 58.75.25,26) and two matching side chairs (58.75.33,34) all stamped by Georges Jacob. There were also two similar armchairs (58.75.30,31) and one small settee, or marquise (58.75.27), also by Jacob but part of another set. In addition, there were a settee (58.75.24), two armchairs (58.75.29,32), and a second marquise (58.75.28) executed at a later date to match the design of accession numbers 58.75.27,30,31. The wall hangings have the accession numbers 58.75.35-37. See Dauterman, Parker, and Standen 1964, pp. 61-75, nos. 7-9.3. Feulner 1927, p. 675, fig. 600.

Caskets were made and used by girls in the 17th century. The girls would decorate small panels with embroidery which would then be sent to a cabinet-maker to be made up into a casket. They were often fitted with compartments for sewing and writing as well as a small mirror. Many cabinets also had secret compartments, used to store personal possessions such as jewellery or letters. The high cost of the materials, as well as the skill needed to create these caskets, means they could only have been made in wealthy households.

<b>People</b>
The panels were worked by young girls, aged around 11 or 12, as part of their education. Girls started learning needlework skills aged 6 or 7, first creating a band sampler (see T.433-1990) and then moving on to more complex pieces such as cutwork. Embroidering the panels of a casket or for a mirror (see T.17-1955) appears to have been one of the last stages of a girl’s needlework education. These skills would be useful later in life in the management of a household.

<b>Materials & Designs</b>
Biblical, mythological and classical scenes were all popular themes for decorating caskets. While some girls may have designs their own panels, taking inspiration from sources such as illustrated bibles, it also appears to have been possible to have purchased designs, which the embroiderer could then customise by using certain colours or adding in features.","Embroidery"

The top depicts Jacob asleep under a tree, on the left we can see his dream of the ladder and angels. The sides of the lid are split into rectangular sections each with a stylised motifs including fruit, rabbits and flowers. The side panels all depict different scenes, on the front is a hunter with a spear and horn and two dogs chasing a stag. On the left panel is the meeting of Laban and Jacob, on the back is Jacob and Rachel at the well and on the right is Laban (?) seated before a tent, Jacob kneeling and Rachel (?) standing on the right.

<b>Materials and Making</b>
Needlework and embroidery were seen as a crucial skill for women in the seventeenth century. Girls started learning needlework skills aged 6 or 7, first creating a band sampler and then moving on to more complex pieces. Embroidering panels for a workbox or casket was often the final piece in a girl’s education. Many surving seventeenth century workboxes are heavily decorated in raised work, also known as stumpwork. Unusually this workbox is not. The geometric design of the flowers is characteristic of the late seventeenth century, indicating it was made slightly after most of the workboxes which still survive which typically date to 1640-1680.

The survival of so many embroideries worked in wool or silk on linen canvas reflects the popularity of such work in the 16th and 17th centuries, when it was used extensively for furnishings. It is likely that many pieces of this type also survived because, unlike richer embroideries with metal thread, those made of less valuable materials were not dismantled.

The arrangement of tiny running stitches in black mimics the subtle shading of woodblock prints, giving a three-dimensional effect to the pattern.

The gauntlets of these gloves are embroidered with motifs which also appear on other objects made in the late Elizabethan era—a disembodied eye raining pale blue and silver tears, a colorful pansy flower, and a bright green parrot with pearls on its wings. The weeping eye is related to a contemporary emblem book, Henry Peacham's Minerva Britanna, or A Garden of Heroical Devises of 1612, though this motif was known as a symbol of unrequited love well before the publication of Peacham's book.The pansy, watered by the tears of the weeping eye, was a popular flower in the Elizabethan era. It was known to be a favorite of the queen herself and the pansy continued to appear in embroidery well into the seventeenth century.Despite the present fragile and somewhat degraded condition of these gloves, they retain enough of their sumptuous embroidery to convey the luxury of the highest quality needlework of the late Tudor and early Stuart era.","Embroidery"

The technique was used to create pictures and to decorate objects such as storage boxes for jewelry and writing supplies, baskets, and mirror frames. This box is typical of raised-work pieces in that it employs a variety of stitches and includes the use of metal thread and other materials, in addition to colored silks. The faces of the five women representing the Senses are drawn in ink on satin, and the figure of Sight holds a mirror made of mica that reflects her face. Other unexpected materials were frequently used to highlight details: real hair for a figure's head, tiny seed pearls for a necklace, and glass beads for animal eyes.Allegorical and biblical subjects, along with portraits of monarchs, were the most common themes for the decoration of a seventeenth-century box. Of the seven complete and partial boxes in the Museum's collection, the majority show biblical scenes, although these are sometimes combined with depictions of the Senses or the Seasons.Raised work had a rather short period of popularity and was at its peak during the mid-seventeenth century. The creation of raised-work boxes, mirror frames, and pictures ceased to be a fashionable occupation by the turn of the eighteenth century, if not sooner.","Embroidery"

It is divided into two parts—""matters Civil"" and ""matters Sacred""—and includes additional material gathered from his supporters about events surrounding his death. It constitutes an expanded edition of an earlier compilation, the Eikon Basilike [Image of the King]: The Poutraicture of His Sacred Maiestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings, a 1649 printing of which is bound into the second part of the volume. The Eikon Basilike purported to be a collection of the writings of Charles I that presented the major events of his life and reign from his own point of view in language that was simple, direct, and, for a monarch, unprecedentedly personal. This narrative was interspersed with the king’s favorite prayers and psalms in a style that directly echoed the Penitential Psalms of King David and thereby offered both a justification of his rule and a kind of spiritual autobiography.The Eikon Basilike was first published by Richard Royston, who was the leading Royalist publisher in London throughout the Civil War period and who was imprisoned in 1645 for issuing ""scandalous books and papers"" against the Parliament and thereafter in constant danger of further harassment at the hands of the Council of State. By his own account, Royston received orders directly from the king in October 1648 to prepare his printing press; on December 23 he was given the manuscript through an Edward Simmons, as from the king, and had it printed. Charles’s authorship has been contested from its first appearance to the present day, although it is now widely agreed (as the Royalist apologists had insisted) that the core of the book was Charles’s but that the materials were shaped into their final form by his chaplain, the Presbyterian divine John Gauden, later bishop of Exeter.From the beginning, the Eikon Basilike was a hugely popular best-seller and became the chief focus of national grief and guilt after the king’s death. The book was sold on the streets of London on January 30, 1649, the day of Charles’s execution, and went through thirty-five English editions that year. It became, in effect, a form of common property, hotly debated among Parliamentarian detractors and their Royalist opponents and prompting numerous rebuttals and counter-rebuttals, including John Milton’s furious rejoinder, Eikonoklastes, which appeared on October 6, 1649. As Elizabeth Wheeler emphasized, the Eikon Basilike had no single fixed appearance and from the first was subject to numerous additions of text and images. The work also appeared in a range of cheap to expensive editions and in different formats, from regular folio size to tiny miniature versions.The present copy of Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae is one product of this process, although Frances Madan noted that all the additional materials within were vouched for by persons who were near the king and involved in the publication process of the original Eikon Basilike. It includes a miscellany of the king’s speeches to Parliament, his ""Messages for Peace,"" and, in the second part, a selection of his prayers, the text of the Eikon Basilike, his ""papers about Church Government,"" a list of the judges who officiated at Charles’s trial in a section headed ""Severall things relating to His Majesties Death, a list of London’s mayor and city aldermen, and various speeches and epitaphs by others made after the king’s death. According to Madan, this edition was published in London by Roger Norton with the false Hague imprint of Samuel Browne, suggesting that there was an inherent danger for Royston and his London printer, Roger Norton, in publishing such materials during these years.The embroidered cover of this volume has on the front the figure of a woman holding a cornucopia, probably representing Plenty; on the back is a woman holding a palm branch, presumably Peace. Plenty and Peace were likely qualities that the owner attached to monarchical rule. Embroidered references or borrowings from the Eikon Basilike include in the Victoria and Albert Museum collection an embroidered panel after the William Marshall engraving used as the frontispiece for the 1649 version of the Eikon Basilike (inv. no. T.117-1936). The frontispiece of this volume is an engraved portrait of Charles I by Wenceslaus Hollar (MMA, 17.50.85) that is derived from the double portrait of Charles and Henrietta Maria by Anthony van Dyck.[Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

Unlike other gloves of the time, which have separately constructed and highly decorated gauntlets that appear far too fragile to wear, this pair would have been relatively functional.These gloves were said to have belonged to James I, primarily because of the presence of the Scottish thistle in the embroidery, but there is no conclusive evidence of this connection. This attribution was first asserted by W. B. Redfern in 1904 and repeated by Frances Morris in 1929. As an insignia of royalty after James’s accession to the English throne, the thistle motif was usually combined with the Tudor rose to represent the union of England and Scotland under one ruler, as on an early seventeenth-century embroidered cushion cover with the royal arms surmounted by a large rose and two small stylized thistles, now held in the Victoria and Albert Museum.Beginning in the late sixteenth century, gloves play an increasingly visible role in portraiture, and their functions were practical as well as symbolic. This pair may be similar to the type of leather glove with metallic thread fringe described in the wardrobes of both sons of James I, as described in surviving inventories and bills for both princes’ wardrobes. Accounts from about 1608 for Henry, Prince of Wales, included ""four pair of staggs leather gloves, perfumed and fringed with gold and silver fringe, at 16s."" And his younger brother, Charles, when he was king, ordered similar gloves in even larger quantities during the 1630s: ""2 dozen pairs of thick stags lether gloues with gold and silver fringes."" Charles I is also depicted wearing a similar pair of gloves of gray-brown leather with embroidered gauntlets and metallic thread fringe in Daniel Mytens’s 1629 portrait of the king (MMA, 06.1289).[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

The 1601 inventory of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury (1527-1608), included two quilts that were almost certainly products of this trade: “a quilt of yellow India stuff embroidered with birds and beasts” and “a quilt of India stuff embroidered with beastes.""¹ Indian quilts of the type produced for the Portuguese market appeared with increasing frequency in London sales into the 1620s, when their value began to decline, perhaps because of diminishing novelty.²The taste for Indian-style embroidery remained, however, and it is interesting to note that the English maker of this textile used not only the Indian palette of golden yellow on white but also an imported Indian cotton as the foundation. The cover has rare seventeenth-century marks on the plain-weave cotton fabric: the initials G.C.E. (for the English East India Company's original name, The Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies) as well as three other stamps whose significance has not yet been deciphered.³ On this bedcover, the embroidered designs draw heavily on such exotic motifs as pineapple-like vegetation and serrated leaves, but contemporary European sensibilities are also evident in the strapwork connecting the floral elements. Additionally, the three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the use of stitches with long floats that create a shinier surface to contrast with the matte appearance of the cotton ground diverge from the Indian prototypes, whose flatter chain stitches are less glossy. English bedcovers were usually part of coordinated sets that could include bolsters, pillows, and matching valances⁴In addition to the more common monochrome yellow-on white embroideries, Indian polychrome embroideries also arrived in England during the early seventeenth century. They, too, are described in sale records; for example, a 1614 sale included “a carpet or quilt embroidered upon calico with sundry silks.""⁵  The word “carpet” is probably used in its contemporaneous sense, that is, to signify decorative covers for a variety of furniture types, including beds. MMA 1970.173, an English polychrome silk and metal-thread bedcover, is more obviously dependent on the stylistic composition of Persian and Turkish carpets than this textile. By the eighteenth century, both embroidered and painted cotton textiles of this type, with a central medallion and smaller medallions in the corners of the central field, were being made in India for domestic consumption and for export.⁶  These imported polychrome covers had a lasting influence on the production of English embroidered bed furnishings of the eighteenth century.

Although such beadwork baskets clearly did not lend themselves to this kind of practical use, their imagery is also usually celebratory and commemorative of marriage or betrothal. Such is the case with this piece, which celebrates the union in 1662 of King Charles II and Catherine of Braganza. They stand in the center of the satin panel, surrounded by a profusion of fruits and flowers that is generally suggestive of fecundity, although such elements as the butterflies, a radiant sun, and an oak sapling may have been chosen for their specifically Royalist associations. In this context, the peacock at the center beneath the royal couple may be an emblem of the Restoration, as the peacock’s traditionally incorruptible body was associated with rebirth and resurrection. The four female figures who stand around the royal couple are the Four Continents, identifiable by the creatures that accompany them. Europe with a stag stands at top left, Asia with a leopard at top right. The lower register is less clear because of the interchangeability of the figures’ attributes, but nonetheless the griffin probably represents Africa and the cockatrice America (see also MMA, 39.13.2a). The placement of the royal couple at the center of the Four Continents was to situate their union within the wider compass of a divinely appointed natural order.A number of very similar beadwork baskets survive from the third quarter of the seventeenth century and share the same essential structure: a rectangular frame made from heavy gauge wire, spherical feet, and everted sides extending outward from the base, with regular intervals of wire of the same gauge forming square openings. The handles are bent in a trefoil shape and extend from the center of each of the four sides. The wire is wrapped in variegated colored patterns of beads.It has been suggested that the introduction of beadwork into English embroidery was related to a growing trade with the Far East, Africa, and the Americas. Glass beads, or ""bugles,"" were produced on a large scale in Venice and Amsterdam in the seventeenth century and shipped in quantity to ports near London, where they were destined to be traded for fine materials that were imported to Europe. Joan Edwards speculated that the use of these beads in embroidery must have developed suddenly after the 1630s when this trade first began. She posited that haberdashers, merchants, or bead traders, who often also sold wire, realized the market potential of the use of such beads in women’s embroidery. Many raised-work pictures of the period also incorporate glass beads, demonstrating an appetite for the unusual and exuberant.It is probable that baskets of this kind were made by professionals or perhaps sold as kits. Certainly, it is likely that the intricate and lifelike fruits were professionally produced. Even the king and queen are produced on a slip of canvas and were probably prefabricated. This is substantiated by a strikingly similar basket, from the Untermyer collection, now at Colonial Williamsburg, which has the same form of frame and whose applied fruits and flowers with an identically posed king and queen are worked in the same beaded pattern and colors.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

Some of the objects clearly do not match the casket’s seventeenth-century date. Thread, both dyed silk and metal varieties, was purchased by weight, and the number of objects devoted to the organization of threads speaks to the value of this material. Decorated boxes intended to store sewing implements, among other things, were known on the Continent as well as in England; several seventeenth-century Dutch cushion-shaped containers survive, and seventeenth-century genre paintings confirm their practical use as supports for sewing.The completion of a decorated casket or cabinet would have been considered the culmination of a young woman’s education in needlework skills, and a few boxes have survived that can be firmly attributed to schoolgirls. Martha Edlin’s dated embroidered objects form the most complete record we have of one person’s output in the seventeenth century (Victoria and Albert Museum, London), although professional contributions at any point in the work would certainly have been possible. The exuberance of the decoration and the rather indiscriminate combination of materials and techniques suggest that this casket is the work of an amateur. Contrast this with the cabinet illustrating scenes from the Life of Joseph (MMA, 39.13.3a-k), which was executed in a single technique (laid and couched silk) and precisely and evenly worked on all faces of the box. This casket also lacks the consistency of theme present on most cabinets; the top of the lid shows the meeting of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba, whereas the side panels are apparently random combinations of motifs typical of the period: heraldic animals, a castle, and a fountain, all surrounded by oversized flora and fauna. It is possible that the embroidered panels of this casket may have been applied to the wood carcass at a date significantly later than the execution of the decoration. The carcass itself is too large for the embroidered panels; the gaps where the satin foundation fabric does not cover the wood are patched with more silk and disguised with metal bobbin lace. The color and style of the lining—green silk with a padded main compartment—differ from most other boxes of the seventeenth century as well. Another casket in the Lady Lever Art Gallery collection has a similar padded interior, but the silk lining is described as the typical salmon-pink color.Nevertheless, this casket is important for its possible association with a mirror in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection (MMA, 39.13.2a). The back of the mirror frame is marked with the initials A.P. and the date 1672, and the casket contains thread holders or winders and a metal bodkin marked with the same initials. Both of these objects were in the collection of Percival Griffiths, and early scholars assumed that they were the work of the same maker. Although the mirror frame displays a more skilled and certain command of techniques and materials, it does contain some unusual elements, such as actual shells used in the decoration of the grotto. G. Saville Seligman and Talbot Hughes mentioned ""Lady Ann Paulet, who was a very accomplished broiderer"" in association with these embroideries, possibly referring to a lady-in-waiting to Queen Mary II (1662–1694), but no other evidence exists to support this attribution. The uncertain date of the construction of the casket, along with the survival of various tools and accessories, speaks to the continued significance of embroidery in the lives of women beyond the seventeenth century.[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

In addition to this miniature, other examples include: two in the Victoria and Albert Museum, one in the Wallace Collection in London, one in Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, and one in the collection of John H. Bryan, which is housed in a silver-gilt frame engraved with the royal armorial and date of Charles’s execution, 30 January 1648 (old calendar). Like a painting in silk thread, this miniature represents the merging of two English artistic traditions—a naturalistic rendering of faces using fine techniques such as split stitch, which had been in use in England since the twelfth century, and the painted miniature portrait, a courtly fashion that began during the reign of Henry VIII.The king’s likeness has been taken with great fidelity from a 1641 etching by Wenceslaus Hollar, which was itself ultimately derived from a chain of different prints based on a painted portrait by Anthony van Dyck of Charles I and his consort, Henrietta Maria, painted in 1632. Oliver Millar has noted that van Dyck’s painting is in itself a reworking of the original composition by Daniel Mytens of ca. 1630-32, in the Royal Collection, Hampton Court Palace.The embroidery is contained within a glazed silver frame with molded edges and a suspension loop at the top, flanked on either side by a spiral ribbon cresting. The glass has beveled edges, and its various imperfections and minute air bubbles suggest that it is original to the period. An example of what Daphne Foskett calls a ""cabinet miniature,"" it was intended to be mounted in a cabinet or placed on a table.The bust of Charles is slightly raised from the flat gray-green satin background, an effect produced by the portrait’s having been stitched on satin. The king’s characteristic hairstyle, pointed beard, and upturned moustache are convincingly shaded in various tones of brown, brown-red, and light blond threads. Strands of hair are worked directly on the satin, with the raised portion skillfully merged into the background. The cheeks and jawline are also enhanced by shadowy tones that suggest both stubble and facial bone structure. Each thread is worked in a virtuoso technique that varies the stitch length, tension, and twist in such a way as to manipulate the play of light over the silk fibers. The intensity of detail can be grasped in a number of passages, such as Charles’s right eye, which is created from an amalgam of minute stitches. One can see under magnification that the lower lid is outlined by a minute pink thread, couched down, and worked over by a mass of flesh-toned silk. The iris is laid down in several shades of blue thread, separated from the black pupil by a lighter couching thread, which not only suggests depth by pulling the other threads around the pupil, but also creates the catch-light that defines Charles’s expression.The extraordinarily developed detail of this and the other, similar miniature portraits of the king led at one time to their being dated to the later eighteenth century, when interest in the cult of the martyred king was still strong. J.L. Nevinson, however, demonstrated the use of such techniques in other works that can be firmly placed in the period between 1650 and the end of the seventeenth century, including an embroidered bookbinding with a detailed portrait of a youth now in the Houghton Library at Harvard University that contains a copy of Hopkins’s Psalms dated 1648. It is likely then that the miniature was produced in the second half of the seventeenth century, either before or, as Nevinson posited, in the years immediately following the Restoration and is thus part of the imagery associated with the cult of the Royal Martyr.The link with the cult of Charles the Martyr is made explicit by the embroidered inscription, a quotation from Psalm 18, which associates Charles directly with the Old Testament patriarch King David: ""Deus meus est Rvpis mea Psa: 18."" The reference is to Psalm 18:2–3, which invokes God’s protection against his enemies: ""The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies."" Although the connection between contemporary monarchs and King David was a commonplace one, the specific association made here, of Charles I with the Psalms of King David, assumed a central importance in his posthumous cult. It drew from that most popular of all commemorative works, the literary ""self-portrait"" of the martyred king, the Eikon Basilike, a book notionally containing Charles Stuart’s own apologia for his life and reign, which, with its inclusion of the king’s favorite prayers and psalms, offered a kind of spiritual autobiography. Both the prayers and the meditations of the Eikon Basilike explicitly echo the Psalms of David. Indeed, the embroidered image is taken directly from a print that serves as the frontispiece of the Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae of 1651, an expanded edition of the king’s works with a bound-in 1649 version of the Eikon Basilike. As Elizabeth Wheeler has shown, the ""repeated evocation of the Psalms, the emphasis on conscience, the insistence on the depth and sorrow of his sufferings"" found in this work all presented a figure intimately accessible to ordinary laymen and women.This intimacy was reflected in small-scale portraits like the present example and other small commemorative objects that were made in the years immediately after the king’s execution. They reflect, too, the peculiarly private aspect of mourning for the king that characterized the ten-year period before the Restoration, during which time there were few permitted outlets for public grief. As Lois Potter has suggested, this circumstance conditioned the nature of the ensuing cult of the martyred king and in particular stimulated the production of such small, intimate kinds of memorial art. The inclusion of the scriptural inscription explicitly offered up the image of the martyred king as a spiritual model. The tradition that the monarch’s own hair was worked into the image would have further emphasized the character of a relic. A number of such objects are recorded in the former collection of Percival D. Griffiths. A poem by Jeremiah Wells (1646–1679), written in reaction to an analogous small-scale portrait of Charles drawn in ink on parchment, which he saw in the library of St. John’s College, Oxford, in 1665, vividly conveys the ecstatic emotions such portraits could summon up. In the latter portrait, the identification of Charles with King David is made literally indelible, for the lines of the face and hair are rendered in minute script that supposedly contain the whole Book of Psalms, or at least the Penitential Psalms. In a manuscript draft of the poem (later amended), Wells begins: ""Wash thy impure feet, and trembling trace / With wary steps this more than sacred place."" The first stanza of the published version continues in similarly hyperbolic fashion, mystically equating the king’s body with the divine word:""With double reverence we approach to lookOn what’s at once a picture and a book:Nor think it Superstition to adoreA king made now more sacred then before . . .The object here’s Majestick and divine,Divinity does Majesty enshrine . . .""A portrait of the playwright Thomas Killigrew, painted by William Shephard one year after the king’s execution, when Killigrew was in Venice as the political agent of the exiled Charles II, provides visual evidence, similarly rhetorical, as to how such images of the king were used. Killigrew sits at his desk with a (somewhat larger) portrait of Charles I on the wall behind him. He adopts a classic attitude of melancholy, which in other circumstances might have signified merely his own creative temperament, but which in this context may be taken to connote a stoical, philosophical grief for the executed king. His loyalty to the Stuart cause is further underlined by the copy of the Eikon Basilike that lies beneath the pile of his own plays. It is easy to imagine the embroidered portrait miniature eliciting similar kinds of response.[Jonathan Tavares and Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

The château, situated on a hillside overlooking the Seine not far from Paris, became the queen's favorite summer residence. Built in the sixteenth century and rebuilt during the seventeenth, the palace was in need of renovation. The architect Richard Mique (1728–1794) enlarged and altered it, and appropriate furnishings were ordered for the queen's apartment.Many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené (1748–1803), a member of an important dynasty of Parisian chair makers who received a royal appointment in 1784. Sené provided a set of seat furniture for the queen's dressing room, called her cabinet particulier ox cabinet de toilette that is described in the 1789 inventory of Saint Cloud. The daybed (41.205.1), the bergère (a comfortable chair upholstered between the arms and the seat, 41.205.2), and the fire screen (41.205.3a, b) from the set are now in the Museum's collections. They were the gift of Ann Payne Blumenthal, the second wife of George Blumenthal. The painted and gilt frame of the low daybed is embellished with floral motifs. Six short tapering and fluted legs surmounted by Ionic capitals support the piece. The front stiles of the head- and footboard, which are of equal height, are carved with female half-figures wearing Egyptian headdresses. The bergère, which has a medallion with Marie Antoinette's initials on its top rail, is decorated in a similar manner. A decade before Napoleon's North African campaign was to inspire the fashion known as égyptomanie, the queen appears to have had a taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art. Seated classical female figures, rather than Egyptian caryatids, decorate the feet of the fire screen, and a woman who once held a cornucopia reclines on its top. The carver is not known, but Louis-François Chatard (ca. 1749–1819) was responsible for painting and gilding the frames.According to the 1789 inventory the set was originally upholstered in a white-twilled cotton with rows of individual flowers embroidered by the queen herself.

The body of the garment is a Portuguese white silk of the late seventeenth—early eighteenth century brocaded with polychrome silk and chenille yarns. The bright white satin ground of the center panels at front and back are embroidered with silk and silver threads; the materials of this center panel, including the satin ground fabric, are likely from Asia.¹ Narrow metallic woven bands, or galloons, outline the panels and neckline.²A variety of images—including fanciful fountains, unicorns amid cypress trees, spotted leopards, peacocks with tails in full display, and several figures including Hercules and the haloed Christ Child—have been scattered by the weaver throughout the largely secular brocade of the side panels.³ In contrast, the subject matter of the embroidered center panels is entirely Christian. On the front panel are the embroidered initials IHS, the Latin anagram for Jesus Christ used by the Jesuits, while the back panel bears a superimposed A and M for ""Ave Maria"" (or Hail Mary), the archangel Gabriel’s salutation to the Virgin as reported in Luke 1:28. Above the two letters is a crown, and the entire image is surrounded by lilies. An embroidered inscription, qui pascitu inter lilia, a phrase from the Song of Songs (6:3) that translates as ""He who feedeth among the lilies,"" surrounds a silver Paschal Lamb (representing the Lamb of God). Other Christian symbols in the panels include the Pelican in Her Piety, a flowering rose, and a silver pomegranate. The many references to the Virgin in the imagery suggest that this chasuble was used in a convent or in a Jesuit church dedicated to Marian devotion.⁴This elaborate embroidery, with its variety of silk and metallic threads, shares traits and materials from both Portugal and Asia. The multicolor bands that represent the pelican, for example, are typical of Philippine embroidery (detail), yet the bright yellow dye is weld, a European dyestuff.⁵ The flatness of the needlework and its limited palette, as well as the detailed rendering of the individual feathers at the tips of the birds’ wings, are features that may be more Asian than European. A Peruvian example, based on an Asian model, also depicts bird feathers in this way.⁶  It may be that the embroidery took place in Portugal, with artisans also following the Asian model, using a composite of Asian and Portuguese materials. [Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1. The brocade, a five-harness silk on a white satin ground with weft float patterning, includes a number of different colors and types of yarns. Some are unspun silk, others are plied two-color (black and white), and still others are chenille yarns with a pile. The two center panels are a white satin seven-harness ground fabric with warp and weft yarns bearing no twist, which likely was imported from China. The embroidery for the silk is satin stitch, with couching stitches to hold the metallic yarns that outline the designs. The embroidery is sparse, revealing the white background throughout. 2. The tape is composed of weft-faced plain weave with silk warp and silk wrapped with metal-sheet weft. 3. This imagery is related to that in a more narrative panel with a large fountain as its central motif (Metropolitan Museum, acc. no. 35.30). Adele Weibel has identified this type of fabric as either Portuguese or from Extremadura in Spain and believes that a group of related textiles with fountains and chenille threads were produced by the same (unknown) master weaver; see Weibel, Two Thousand Years of Textiles, pp. 151—52, nos. 272 and 276.

The text describes a painting displayed in the Temple of Saturn in Thebes that showed the journey through life and the pathway to true happiness. This hanging depicts the penultimate episode in the journey: the protagonist is beckoned from his path by a woman representing False Learning. Elegant figures in courtly dress are distracted from true wisdom and happiness by dedicating too much energy to the pursuit of knowledge through debate, philosophy, geometry, astrology and alchemy, geography, astronomy, arithmetic, and music.This hanging is one of a set of three (the others are in the Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris and the Metropolitan Museum). Their design was adapted from a woodcut illustrating The Table of Cebes made by David Kandel of Strasbourg in 1547. Notwithstanding the difference in scale (the woodcut is just over 12 by 15 inches), the designer of the embroidery borrowed the principal figures from the woodcut's central scene, inventively adding a warm palette of greens, reds, and yellows. The whole is enclosed by an imaginative border of cavorting grotesques and includes the coat of arms of the De Fenis de Prade family surrounded by the collar of the Order of Saint Michael (upper left) and a second unidentified armorial enclosed by a widow's cordeliere (upper right). With its monumental scale, this needlework is a rare surviving example of a fashion for embroideries that emulated the scale and appearance of tapestries, their more expensive woven counterparts.","Embroidery"

The proportions of this example indicate that it was used over a table rather than on a bed. The floral designs—elegant Renaissance-style scrolling vines with carnations, irises, and other flowers as well as hummingbirds seeking nectar—are constructed with brilliant yellow silk embroidered on a natural linen ground (outlines in brown tannin ink, drawn for the embroiderers to follow, are still visible in some areas). The golden yellow color, a favorite in Iberia for textiles, was derived from weld, a local dyeplant that thrived in the region and was relied on for its brilliance and durability.¹ Although the contrast between the yellow silk and the ecru ground echoes that of certain Indian embroideries made in Bengal and imported into Portugal and Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (see MMA1975.4, MMA 23.203.1), the ease of the design and the variety in stitch type (including satin, chain, and stem as well as various kinds of knots and filling stitches) help identify this as a European cover. The configuration of the cover’s decorative elements constitutes a basic format that may have originated in Islamic Spain. In particular, the large central field with a series of outer borders, including a broad center border flanked, or ""protected,"" by narrower guard borders on either side, was an established style for carpets throughout the Islamic world and one that influenced other regional textile designs, notably Spanish embroidery (the demarcation of the four outer corners in this example may, however, be more Iberian than Islamic in character). This design approach, in turn, was transmitted around the world via Spanish and Portuguese colonial administration and trade, from tapestries made by Andean weavers in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Peru (see MMA 56.163) to Asian and Indian embroideries intended for the European market (see MMA 1975.208d). Given the shared heritage of Portugal and Spain, especially during the sixteenth century, when both countries were united under a single ruler, it can be difficult to differentiate the embroidery production of one from the other.² Both regions had longstanding traditions of fine textiles, from folk works to commissions made by professional guilds for the Church and royal court. This example lies somewhere in between: although the cover was intended for actual household use, its intricate style and high quality suggest that it was made for a person of means and status.

This type of composition is often associated with the influence of Portuguese and Spanish models, although there are some earlier Asian examples that employ this format as well.² Wholly Asian in subject and style, however, are the motifs. The pair of phoenixes at the center of the textile encircle a large peony. Similar dynamically posed birds are also seen in an architectural stone relief excavated from the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) capital and now in the National Museum of China, Beijing, as well as in a corresponding textile in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum,³ and peonies often figure in Ming rank badges, in which a pair of birds encircle a flower. Within the rectangular field are flowers and four more birds -- two golden pheasants and two peacocks, which were used as insignia for the second and third civil ranks in both Ming and Qing China. The multiple borders surrounding the central field include a wide border embroidered with various animals—rare creatures such as a tiger and elephant in addition to the familiar horse, deer, and goat, all of which are depicted side by side with such distinctively mythical Chinese beasts as a blue qilin and a white, singlehorned xiezhi. A composite animal with hooves and usually a single horn, the qilin is mentioned in poetry as early as the Han dynasty (206 b.c.–a.d. 220),⁴ its appearance was sometimes said to signal the birth of a sage, and it was used as a rank insignia for nobles. The xiezhi also appears in Han dynasty texts; known for its ability to distinguish virtue from evil, it used its sharp teeth and single horn to bite and gore wrongdoers, and it was the insignia for the censorate, which included judges. Here, both animals have flames shooting off their bodies, indicating their supernatural powers. Embroideries of this type were made for export, and a number have been preserved in Japan and Europe in historical contexts. The oldest documented example is an altar cloth in Saikyo￣ ji, a temple in Kyoto; it was donated in 1616.⁵ Another example, now in the Museo Diocesano, Chiavari, Italy, was donated to a church in Chiavari in 1651 and used as a baldachin, or canopy, for the clergy.⁶  Others are preserved in museum collections.⁷Chinese textiles and other goods came to the Americas via the Manila galleons’ annual trips between Acapulco (and Callao, the port city of Lima) and the Philippines. While to date no preserved embroideries from this group have been found in Mexico or Peru, their influence was present there by the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century,⁸ as evident in the similar layout and motifs of a Peruvian tapestry in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 33).⁹[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1.

Originally, these curtains may have been part of a larger suite of furnishings for the decoration of an entire bedroom–a canape (settee) now in the private rooms of Madame de Maintenon at Fontainebleau has very similar embroidered designs.¹ The complete set of bed hangings probably included matching upper valances for the tester, lower valances for the frame supporting the mattresses, and a coordinating bedcover and headcloth, like the set of French bedroom furnishings now in the Metropolitan Museum (see MMA 53.2.1a-d, .2a-d). Oversize fanciful flora, a design element familiar from the so-called bizarre silks, are joined in these curtains by human figures dressed in vaguely Chinese garments, imaginary Asian winged dragons, and pairs of long-tailed birds. Early chinoiseriestyle furnishings, made in sturdy tent and cross stitches on canvas, were used over a wide geographic area in northern Europe during the first half of the eighteenth century, and a good number have survived.² The Metropolitan’s side curtains, with their yellow background, are most likely French, as extant examples of the yellow or pale backgrounds are associated with production or use in France. To date, no documentation regarding the commission or production for these various suites of furnishings has been discovered, though we know that another such group was probably ordered from Paris in 1721 for Favorite Palace in Ludwigsburg, Germany, the summer residence of Sybilla Augusta, margravine of Baden-Baden (1675–1733).³ Most of these embroideries, however, were worked on a dark background, either blue or black, and are therefore more closely connected with the aesthetic of English tapestries from the likes of John Vanderbank, with their reference to the dark backgrounds of Asian lacquer screens (see MMA 53.165.2). No design drawings or sources have been identified for these embroideries, which, like the Vanderbank tapestries, are decorative pastiches probably taking inspiration from the same variety of sources employed by contemporary tapestry designers, including imported fabrics and their European counterparts, the bizarre silks.⁴ A feature of Chinese art that confounded and intrigued European observers is very much present in these embroideries. Writers from the late seventeenth and well into the eighteenth century remarked on the asymmetry that was prevalent in Chinese design and architecture, as opposed to the preference for symmetry and pleasing proportion in Western taste.⁵ These early chinoiserie embroideries embody the attempt to capture the beautiful disorder"" that Europeans found so irresistible.

These natural and supernatural symbols were popular embellishments for housewares, costume, and accessories, as can be seen in a portrait of Ellen Maurice (2017.249), where she holds a glove richly embroidered with gold serpents. This arrangement of symbols may suggest protection from something uncertain. The serpent was understood as a sign of wisdom or prudence—and sea monsters could emblemize danger or the unknown.

Its border illustrates incidents taken from the first six tapestries of the set, embroidered in tent stitch using wool and silk in brilliant red, pink, blue, and dark blue-green colors. The tablecloth is also based on a set of eight woodcuts by John Le Clerc, made about 1587, which are thought to have been copied from the tapestry series. The widespread popularity of the story is apparent from the number of its depictions that have survived.The scenes shown extol the ideal pleasures of Arcadian life. Macée washes her feet in a stream and later raids a bird's nest with Gombaut in a scene taken from the first tapestry. Then they play tiquet, a game similar to croquet, and a man smacks a girl. A bagpipe player performs, the two shepherds dance, and they feast on biscuits, water, and strawberries in scenes taken from the third and fourth tapestries. Finally, Gombaut is betrothed to Macée and marries her in scenes from the fifth and sixth tapestries. Several scenes found in the tapestries are omitted in the embroidery, including the shepherds as children chasing butterflies and the onslaught of wolves that causes Gombaut's unfortunate death and concludes the story. Gombaut's later life is rarely shown in illustrations of the story; the sad approach of death is not in keeping with the idyllic pastoral theme. The harsh realities of peasant life were rarely acknowledged before the nineteenth century. The explanatory French verses, in the late fifteenth-century style, found on the tapestries and also on the woodcut prints are also absent from this tablecloth.","Embroidery"

The top two-thirds of the sampler includes motifs easily classifiable into standard categories, such as alphabetic characters, geometric designs, and floral motifs, worked in silk and linen on a linen ground using several common stitch techniques. An embroidered alphabet marks the end of the top third of the piece. The middle third is worked with white thread on a white ground, a technique commonly known as whitework. This middle section features scattered design motifs and concludes with an embroidered rendering of the maker’s name and dates of production.The bottom third of the piece is worked in reticella, a technique that originated in the late fifteenth century. The technique developed from cutwork and utilized stitches common to embroidery. Threads were pulled from a plain weave linen fabric to create open spaces in which a design was completed and the deconstructed fabric was stabilized primarily with buttonhole stitches. The result is a design based on the grid of the foundation fabric, with open areas throughout and arched and scalloped borders. Subsequently, the technique progressed to the point where the foundation fabric was eliminated and the design was worked over threads temporarily secured to a piece of vellum or paper for stability during the construction of what was called punto in aria (literally, ""stitches in air""), or early needle lace.Designs for reticella were popularized through numerous editions of late sixteenth-century Continental pattern books. Copies of these books made their way into England, and their popularity occasioned the publication of English pattern books, mostly consisting of patterns copied from the earlier book.Although cutwork and needle-lace techniques continued to be popular, especially for fashionable accessories, through the 1630s, there are very few examples of these techniques that have been attributed to English manufacture, despite the number of English samplers that confirm these skills were taught. The finest lace was imported, although the cost was certainly prohibitive for all but the elite. Therefore, the cultivation of practical skill in whitework and lace techniques would enable the maker to produce all manner of trimming necessary to fashionable attire. This sampler was purchased by London’s Royal School of Needlework in 1916; and it is quite possible that it continued to fulfill its seventeenth-century function of being an exemplar for early twentieth-century students.Samplers containing whitework, cutwork, and needle lace were attempted after basic skills were already mastered, if the case of Martha Edlin can be considered typical. She created her polychrome band sampler first and then move on to the more challenging whitework and cutwork embroidery. Women’s training in this standard progression of technical skills was an extraordinarily important part of a seventeenth-century education, particularly for daughters of the upper class and gentry. According to the household accounts of the Verney family, at least two hours each day were set aside for the practice of embroidery under the instruction of a tutor. It was decided that Sir Ralph Verney’s eight-year-old daughter, ""being a girl she shall not learn Latin, so she will have more time to learn breeding [manners] hereafter and needlework too."" Training in embroidery not only prepared a girl in practical necessities, but it also held a moral dimension. Richard Braithwaite in his 1631 text The English Gentlewoman noted that textile production should be considered ""arguments of [her] industry, memorials of [her] piety."" Women were educated in preparation for marriage, to run a household, and to be a good Christian. Verses from the Bible were often read aloud as women performed household sewing and embroidery, instilling the very activity of working with a needle with pious associations.The use of all three embroidery types—colored, whitework, and lace techniques—on a band sampler is relatively rare compared with simpler combinations of colored bands and whitework. As previously noted, it is uncertain how much actual needle-lace trimming was produced in England during the mid-seventeenth century, but there is a relatively large number of surviving whitework samplers dated to the 1640s. Particularly notable are examples that include figural compositions with detached elements.[Emily Zilber, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

By the 1580s portraits of Queen Elizabeth I and several of her courtiers show the sitters wearing embroidered sleeves decorated with an early version of this pattern in monochrome thread (usually black) on white linen.¹  Examples like this coif, made of linen embroidered with polychrome silk and metal threads, were first produced about 1600. This popular scrolling pattern appeared on both men’s and women’s headgear, women’s jackets, and furnishing textiles. The design, which may derive from similar motifs found in Islamic Spain, remained fashionable in England at least until the 1620s.² Features like the small diaper patterns used to fill the interiors of individual leaves and flower petals in blackwork embroidery and the striped or shaded leaves and petals like those seen here continued to be employed in English crewel embroidery of the later seventeenth century. These features are also found in some of the earlier surviving Indian chintz patterns produced for export to Europe. English embroidery patterns and Continental verdure tapestries were sources that contributed to the creation of the lush floral designs seen in late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Indian chintz.³ A miniature version of a scrolling floral pattern appears in one of the earliest surviving Indian chintzes, found on the walls of the circa 1677 dollhouse of Petronella Dunois (1650–1695), now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (no. BK-14656)⁴  A sarasa for the Japanese market (see MMA 2010.55), another type of Indian cotton, also displays this type of pattern, and a much larger-scale variation that includes exotic animals appears on an Indian embroidered bedcover (see MMA 68.61).A number of ornament prints, such as the German artist Bernhard Zan’s design of 1581 (see MMA 20.8.1), could have served as models for European embroideries. Like the rinceaux design itself, ornament prints often had extended periods of use and were circulated and copied long after their original invention. While there is to date no concrete evidence that designs or textiles of this exact type were sent to Indian craftsmen to copy, the practice of sending patterns to India is well documented, and it seems likely that versions of such successful patterns as the European rinceaux with flowers influenced Indian textile production for the international market.

The valance depicts scenes from courtly life, but the precise narrative has not been identified. Yvonne Hackenbroch titled this piece ""The Education of Princess Elizabeth I"" mainly because of the young child with the man in classical garb, said to be a depiction of Elizabeth I’s tutor, Roger Ascham, but there is no other iconography to support this reading. The embroidery could simply illustrate the daily activities of ladies at court, although the interaction of the various figures implies the existence of a specific sequence of events.One possible iconographical reading lies in the identification of contemporary female personifications of the Five Senses. Reading from left to right, the woman gazing into the mirror may personify Sight; the woman with a falcon gesturing toward the young girl may personify Touch; the woman in profile in front of the fountain may represent Smell as she bends toward a potted flower; and the women playing musical instruments would represent Hearing. However, there is no obvious personification of the sense of taste. Additionally, the older man ushering a young girl toward the woman with the falcon, the presence of the jester, and the woman on horseback suggest that a specific narrative is intended.The valance can be compared to other valances and panels with unidentified narratives; similar scenes with equally opaque narratives involving costumed figures and garden settings, for example, are on two valances in the Musée de la Renaissance, Château d’Écouen, documented by Maria-Anne Privat-Savigny in 2003. These hunting and court scenes are interspersed with dramatically posed figures, such as a woman begging on her knees and two decapitations. Other valances and decorative panels of tent stitch illustrate biblical or mythological tales and, more rarely, historical events.Valances of this type have generally been dated to the late sixteenth century, based in part on the attire of the figures and the woven textile patterns that correspond to those found in extant textiles from the period. The clothing closely relates to costume prints from such books as Cesare Vecellio’s Habiti Antichi e Moderni di Diversi Parti del Mondo (1590) and Pierre Bertelli’s Habits des Diverses Nations (1594); these depictions (the first fashion plates) of the dress of various classes and cultures appear to have circulated widely throughout Europe. The use of tent stitch on canvas appeared in England by the middle of the sixteenth century, although it was practiced earlier in France. Santina Levey credits this technique’s introduction to English furnishing textiles to the influence of the French court. It is difficult, therefore, to attribute definitively many of these designs to one place of manufacture, when they were clearly produced in France, Scotland, and England, based on many of the same sources.This panel was most likely one of a set of bed valances intended to decorate the edges of a tester that hung over a bed in order to cover the attachment points of the bed curtains. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the bed was one of the most important pieces of furniture in the household. The finest sets of hangings would have included embroidered inner and outer valances, curtains, a tester, and a counterpane, in addition to embroidered pillows. Embroidered valances were also used to decorate the tops of walls, typically over a wall surface covered in textiles.[Elyse Gerstenecker, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

The three trees that anchor the composition would have brought to mind the biblical description of trees in the Garden of Eden, the Tree of Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. The scene of Adam and Eve being expelled from Eden on the far right may also derive from a reading of contemporary vernacular English Bibles, rather than any pictorial convention. Adam and Eve wear garments that suggest articles of late Elizabethan dress and the Geneva Bible of 1560 referred to their first clothes as ""breeches.""

To some extent, the panel can be classified with other commonly occurring images of the royal couple in contemporary embroidery. These appear to have been primarily celebratory or commemorative in nature, but the direct association made here between contemporary royalty and Adam and Eve is unique among surviving embroidered pictures, indeed among the images of royalty in every medium. It therefore has significance within the wider field of royal iconography of the Caroline era.The embroidery can be dated to a time after 1634, because the poses of Charles I and Henrietta Maria are derived from an engraving by Robert van Voerst first published in that year. The print shows Charles and Henrietta Maria exchanging olive and laurel branches, emblems of peace and military glory, and it celebrates their marriage and the political advantages that accrued from it. The print is a copy of the painting by Anthony van Dyck of 1632, which itself is a reworking of an original by Daniel Mytens of ca. 1630–32.This association between royal marriage and royal authority is carried over into the embroidery, although apart from the poses of the royal couple, it retains little of the symbolism of its prototype. In place of the exchange of olive and laurel branches between the royal couple, Henrietta Maria offers her husband a flower, while Charles holds a sword and scepter, the symbols of worldly dominion. The association of the royal marriage and Charles’s symbols of monarchy with Adam and Eve, the first married couple, carries the suggestion that Charles’s claim to royal authority rests on a chain of royal—specifically familial—descent stretching back to the Fall and even before that, to humankind’s state of innocence. Such a juxtaposition would have resonated in the 1630s and 1640s with the political debates that raged over the nature of political authority. In these debates, the varied justifications for political organization, whether Royalist, Parliamentarian, or Leveller, were invariably based on some understanding of Adamic patriarchy and the first marriage. For all political complexions, the concept of Paradise that had once existed in some place and time provided the key to the way in which ideal social relations once were and should still be.The theme of the panel appears to be an explicit reflection of the Royalist argument, which saw Adamic patriarchy as the basis of the divine right of kings. In The Glasse of Time (1620), Thomas Peyton described James I as ""A royall King deriued from the race, / O f Edens Monarch in her greatest grace, / Within whose face true Maiesty doth shine."" According to Richard Cumberland, a friend of Samuel Pepys, ""Humankind, and by consequence, all Societies and Families sprang from the matrimonial Union of one Man with one Woman. And, consequently, all Civil Government is originally laid out in a natural Parental Authority"" (De Legibus Naturae, 1672). Such arguments and their counter-arguments, which maintained that the right to govern derived from the consent of the people, were furiously debated during the crisis of Parliament and the Civil War years of the 1640s. John Maxwell, chaplain to Charles I, argued in Sacro-Sancta Regum Majestas (1644) that monarchy was fixed by God in the time before the Fall. ""Can we be so stupid as to acknowledge the dominion over all creatures below is given to man immediately by God, and to deny that the most noble and excellent Government by which man hath Power and Empire over men is not from God . . . but by Compact and Contract, the Composition and Constitution of men?"" Sir Robert Filmer, in his Patriarcha: or, The Natural Right of Kings (probably written about 1630, but not published until 1680), justified monarchy on hereditary grounds—that Adam and the patriarchs after him had royal authority over their children by right of fatherhood, and that this authority had been given to them by God. ""The first Father had not only simply power, but power monarchical, as he was a Father immediately from God. For by the appointment of God, as soon as Adam was created he was monarch of the world, though he had no subjects."" For Filmer, Adam’s was ""[a]s large and ample as the Absolutest Dominion of any Monarch which hath been since the Creation.""Such views reached the popular domain via sermons and pamphlets. John Evelyn recorded in a diary entry of May 1678 having heard a sermon that argued for the monarchical over all other systems of government, ""& that from Adam (to whom God had given the Empire of all things & Persons) that it seemed to be not onely of divine, but most natural institution."" And on January 30, 1694, the anniversary of the death of Charles I, Evelyn heard a young man preach on the ""Excellency of Kingly Government above all other, deriving it from Adam, The Patriarchs, God himselfe."" The panel therefore shows an embroiderer directly engaged in these debates, asserting sympathy for the Royalist cause. As such, it shows the expressive freedom of the embroidery medium, which because of its relatively private nature allowed its makers to react personally to events and to create images encompassing themes that lay outside and beyond the iconographical norms of public art, both popular prints and the more exclusive iconography of the court.[Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

The composition of the cover and matching back is dominated by a central royal blazon of the Stuart monarchy quartered with the arms of England, Scotland, and Ireland. The arms are surmounted by the royal crown and supported by a lion and unicorn engaging the shield with the Order of the Garter with its motto: ""Honi Soit Qvi Mal Y Pense"" in silver filé. The royal arms are surrounded by a voluted cartouche accentuated by fronds of tightly packed silver purl, couched down closely onto the green satin ground and headed by a scroll with the inscription ""Gloria Deo."" Flanking this central cartouche are two unidentified badges bearing a crossed silver key and what appears to be a staff, each within a wreath of satin-stitch laurel leaves and silver bells. Beneath and above these is a finely worked voluted interlace of couched silver cording, from which all the foliage, flowers, and heavily fruit-laden festoons hang in thick profusion.The front cover’s degraded condition helps to identify the array of techniques. A surviving coil of couched silver purls on the lower right volute beneath the royal arms suggests that the entire interlace was once filled with such couched silver purls. This is confirmed by the remnants of stitch holes that once held them to the satin surface. In addition, some missing leaves on the festoon reveal how several detached buttonhole leaves were raised by small tufts of wool felt, still present in the spaces of the festoon’s missing leaves. The various fruits are made vivid by a mixture of pink, blue, red, and yellow silk threads blended expertly in long-and-short-stitch silk thread over padding that follows closely the shape of the gourds, apples or peaches, and pomegranates. The grapes are rendered in a variety of stitches, including couched silver purl in the form of grape clusters loosely stitched over with yellow and pink silk floss. The effect is a silvery pink-yellow variegation that mimics the frosty skin of actual grapes. Ink marks of the original design are still visible in places.The royal coat of arms had been associated with the English Bible since the break with Rome in 1534, when Henry VIII proclaimed himself the ""Supreme Head on Earth"" of the Church of England. Thereafter, the royal coat of arms became emblematic not just of the king’s temporal authority, but his spiritual authority as well. The Tudor, and later the Stuart arms, would be emblazoned over the printed Bible and other investitures of ceremony of the English church, examples of which can be found in the collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum. The cover encloses three books bound together: the Geneva version of the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer, printed in 1612 and 1616, respectively, by the London printer Robert Barker, as well as a Book of Psalms, printed by the Company of Stationers in London in 1624, a date that provides a terminus post quem for the binding. As David McKitterick notes, it was not uncommon for such works to be bound together in the seventeenth century, even texts of varied dates such as these. The richness of the cover suggests a ceremonial use. The prominent imprese on the cover, possibly relating to insignias of office, may also imply a more official usage. Yvonne Hackenbroch reported a ""tradition"" (though without supporting documentation) that this volume had been a gift from King James I to Sir Edward Denny, later 1st Earl of Norwich. Although in 1870 Isaac d’Israeli recorded an 18th-century report of a gift of gloves from King James I to Denny, this provenance cannot be confirmed from the imprese, which show no likeness to Edward Denny’s coat of arms and have yet to be identified. It may also be reasonably supposed that James would confer as gifts copies of his own Authorized Version of the Bible, in print since 1611, rather than the older Geneva version, as here. A surviving Master’s Crown of the Broderer’s Company, dated to the second half of the sixteenth century and illustrated in George Wingfield-Digby’s Elizabethan Embroidery (1964), is very similar in design and technique to this Bible cover. As such, the comparison brings the latter into association with an unquestionable piece of professional work of the very highest quality and shows the persistence of style and technique into the seventeenth century.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/adbb93f2-a677-3330-ba38-3615420075be","http://data.silknow.org/graph/met","The binding of this 1649 Bible printed by the Company of Stationers and Book of Psalms printed by Richard Cotes is decorated with two scenes from the Old Testament. The front cover shows Elijah and the Widow of Zarapeth (1 Kings 17:8–16), and the back cover shows Elijah Fed by Ravens (1 Kings 17:1–6), two episodes in the life of the prophet when God provided for him by sending sustenance from unlikely sources, ravens and a poor widow. Although not as common as other biblical scenes rendered in needlework, the numerous depictions of the story of Elijah in paintings and engravings show how familiar these stories would have been to their seventeenth-century audience. Yvonne Hackenbroch suggested a likely source for the front of the embroidered cover in Gerard de Jode’s late sixteenth-century Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamentis, although some of the costumes were updated from this source to reflect contemporary fashion.Two factors lead to the conclusion that this decorated binding is the work of an amateur: the level of proficiency of the embroiderer and the presence of initials, presumably those of the maker. The techniques and materials employed are fewer and simpler than are commonly seen on Bible covers of a professional caliber; the two scenes from the life of Elijah are worked in tent stitch on canvas, which would have been made separately and then applied to the satin background of the book binding. The scenes are then framed in a cartouche of silk-wrapped purl thread, which is applied in a couching technique that would be relatively simple to work. A knot stitch is used on the satin background to make the floral border and the maker’s initials M.B., as well as the spine, which is covered in six registers of flora and fauna. Although tedious to work in this quantity, the stitch is not terribly difficult. The fact that this Bible and Book of Psalms were decorated by an amateur embroiderer shows that the skills so important to a young woman’s education were put to use in the making of decorative objects necessary to a properly appointed household.Like cabinets decorated with raised-worked panels, the finished cover would probably have been delivered, along with the book itself, to a binder who specialized in the application of decorative covers. The same craftsman may have applied the decorative silver metal trim to the edges, as well as the gold metal clasps. The publication date of a book cannot be used as conclusive evidence for the date of any type of cover. However, it is probable that books intended to receive decorative textile covers were intentionally constructed with smooth spines, in order to facilitate the application of the cover and to avoid interrupting the design, unlike the spines with protruding cords, which are commonly found on leather bound books of the period. Nevertheless, the embroidery design on the spine imitates the appearance of leather bindings with the horizontal cords and panels in between.[Katy Reed-Basham and Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

The front cover shows King David in profile playing his lyre, illuminated by divine rays emanating from above. Yvonne Hackenbroch noted that this standing King David derived from a figure of David on the title page of a Bible published in Cambridge in 1629. Hackenbroch also found the source for the pose of the King David on the back cover, where he is posed facing outward and holding a scepter and lyre: the title page of the third volume of Gerard de Jode’s Thesaurus Novi Testamenti (Antwerp, 1585). The spine of this Bible has five registers, each with a tent-stitch flower typical of this period. The flowers from top to bottom are: tulip, cornflower, rose, pansy, and carnation/pink. The needle-worked binding contains three liturgical texts: the New Testament (in Greek), the Book of Common Prayer, and the Book of Psalms (with musical accompaniment).The image of King David, the supposed author of the Psalms, shown here illuminated by divine rays, was an appropriate and conventional image often used to adorn books of Psalms and other liturgical works; numerous examples survive, both professional and amateur. The British Library has several, including one nearly identical in style to the Metropolitan Museum’s copy. It, too, has been made with the sumptuous materials and high-quality craftsmanship of the professional embroiderer. It has the same raised cartouches with masks on both front and back covers but with different images from the life of David within each surround.The Museum’s Bible is said to have belonged to William Laud (1573–1645), who became Archbishop of Canterbury in 1633 and was one of Charles I’s chief ministers. This determination is based on an old (though not contemporary) inscription written in ink on the blue silk on the inside front cover: ""This book formerly belonged to Archbishop Laud."" If this is the case, then the book and its richly worked cover assume a powerful symbolic status. Laud was a pivotal and highly divisive figure in early seventeenth-century English religious and political life, primarily because of his attempts to reform the liturgy and to impose on the English church a richly ceremonial form of worship. This stemmed from a particular view of the divine presence within the physical structure of the church itself. The church was, as the Laudian Robert Skinner proclaimed in 1634 in a sermon before the king, the place where ""our Lord God most holy doth inhabit."" It was ""his proper mansion or dwelling place."" Such a notion of divine presence thus infused all objects used in worship with a spiritual aura. For the Laudian Alexander Read in 1636, all such objects were to be held as ""holy in relation to the holy use whereto it is assigned."" Even the cloth bags used to carry the communion bread into the church were special, ""since the very bringing of it into the church to that use is a taking out of the world, a promotion of it to more reverence and a next step to consecration itself."" This attitude promoted the value of beauty in ecclesiastical ornament and decoration. As the anonymous R.T. wrote in 1638, a church should properly contain ""all kinds of ornaments that might add glory and grace . . . as curious paintings, hangings, gilding, sumptuous vestments, rich gifts of money, chalices, plate."" Within its original context, therefore, the Metropolitan Museum’s richly adorned Bible would have seemed, as Lake put it, to ""glow with the beauty of holiness."" The sense of beauty in reverence extended also to ceremonial and ritual aspects of the liturgy, the rubrics for which were contained within the Book of Common Prayer. Strict adherence to the order of the liturgy was regarded as the surest means of true communion with God and indeed constituted for Laud the only legitimate form of prayer. Whether or not the Metropolitan Bible actually belonged to Laud, it nonetheless embodies the Laudian style, both in the text itself—the Book of Common Prayer, which, containing the whole liturgy, stood at the center of Laudian worship—and in the extravagant richness of its decoration, which infuses it with ""the beauty of holiness.""A sincere Protestant, Laud wished to reinstate such practices and objects into the Church of England, which he regarded as historically and theologically accurate and which predated the corruption of the Church of Rome. As the highest prelate in the land, he sought to impose practices such as bowing to the altar (which replaced the communal ""Lord’s table""), the use of incense in the performance of liturgical prayers, and the use of rich vestments in the exercise of the liturgy. Such actions, as well as his resistance to the Puritan emphasis on bibliocentric piety and preaching, alienated both hardline and moderate Puritans. The introduction of what were widely considered Catholic or popish customs provoked significant opposition. The rebellion in Scotland in July 1637—a reaction to the institution of a new form of liturgy modeled on the English Book of Common Prayer—was what forced Charles I to recall Parliament, which in turn set off a series of events leading to the Civil Wars and Laud’s own eventual execution at the hands of Parliament in 1645.[Katy Reed-Basham and Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

Wool was commonly used for tent stitch or needlework on canvas from the sixteenth century, but this fiber is unusual in pictorial works such as this. Wool is more commonly found on bed furnishings of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries on a cotton twill foundation fabric.The presence of initials and a date probably indicate that this was an amateur production in both design and execution. The composition, which is extraordinarily crowded and naive, even within the genre of seventeenth-century pictures, is a small compendium of religious imagery, each story rendered in a kind of shorthand with only the key scene in the narrative nestled within the pictorial landscape conventions of this type. Hagar and Ishmael, banished from the home of Abraham, exit the scene in the lower left corner, while the princess of Egypt finds the baby Moses to the right. The river that delivered Moses flows from a rocky grotto, home to a mermaid, several types of fantastic fish, and a duck. Above the mermaid’s head at the right, Rebecca offers a drink to Eliezer from an antique urn on which the date 1667 is embroidered. The identity of the king under the central canopy is not certain, but he most likely represents Solomon sitting in judgment, as a woman appears to be pleading for a child in the arms of a cavalier with a sword. This interpretation is strengthened by the presence of a colorful moth or butterfly below the king. If we accept this as a symbol of the restoration of the Stuart monarchy, then the biblical Solomon, with whom King Charles I (father of the contemporary king) had been identified, would have been an appropriate choice. The rest of the panel is populated with flora and fauna, rendered with a typical disregard for relative scale, and a stately home with two small faces behind the mica windows. This particular conflation of religious and secular imagery is interesting for its visual emphasis on the central figure of the king, with other references scattered in a seemingly random fashion around the composition.[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

This association with the Tree of Life in Revelations is reinforced by the curling grape vine wrapped around the trunk of the tree, which is symbolic of the Passion of Christ and the promise of eternal life.The addition of numerous animals and the presence of both the sun and the moon also refer to the abundance of the Garden of Eden in the Book of Genesis.","Embroidery"

The imagery of the Museum's example is derived from engravings after Maarten de Vos which first appeared in Gerard de Jode's 1579 illustrated bible Thesaurus Sacrarum Historiarum Veteris Testamenti, published in Antwerp.

This is the most common type of extant seventeenth-century sampler, and its standard format was established by about 1630. The foundation was generally cut from one complete width of plain-weave linen, so that the selvages are present at what becomes the top and bottom of the finished work, and the sides are hemmed. Polychrome band samplers are typical, although some band samplers combined rows of whitework, cutwork, and needle lace with the polychrome patterns (see MMA, 57.122.368). A band sampler such as this would have most likely been a task completed by a schoolgirl under the supervision of an embroidery instructor of some kind. In fact, a band sampler was usually the first piece worked by a budding embroiderer beginning at about age seven or eight. The complete embroidered works by Martha Edlin, the only extant group of a young girl’s educational work, now housed in the Victoria and Albert Museum, begins with a band sampler as her earliest accomplishment.This example, signed by Anna Bucket, introduces the band sampler into the realm of the decorative by adding an image of a courting couple at the top of the sampler. With its precise date and the name of the maker placed prominently, above the cupid who hovers between the couple, the maker may have been referring explicitly to her actual or hoped-for marriage. The couple is accompanied by a dog, symbol of fidelity in marriage, and surrounded by the heraldic unicorn and lion. The image is a miniature version of the numerous pictures of courting couples in which the man and woman stand on variegated green and yellow grass; in addition to the animals, the scene is embellished with fruiting trees, flowers, and insects completely out of scale to their human companions. This type of sampler may have been displayed in the home, as became common practice in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Contemporary evidence of this practice can be found in the criminal proceedings of the Old Bailey: in December of 1750 a man was convicted for stealing, among other things, ""one needle-work sampler, with a frame and glass.""

The sampler is divided roughly into two parts, with the natural world presented at the top and geometric motifs below.Spot samplers may have come closest to fulfilling the etymological destiny of the sampler, or exemplar, as ""an example to be imitated; a model, pattern; an archetype."" They are composed of collections of patterns and stitches to which the maker might refer when she was in need of inspiration or guidance for a particular technique. They generally do not include a date or a name in the body of the work that would allow a connection to be made with an embroiderer at a certain point in her education.A. J. B. Wace cited the existence of samplers as early as the beginning of the sixteenth century, writing that one was purchased for Elizabeth of York, who died in 1503, and that Elizabeth, Countess of Oxford, who died in 1537, left her two sisters twelve samplers in her will, although it is not clear that these were the work of her own hand. The earliest extant English sampler is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum; it was inscribed and dated by Jane Bostock in 1598. A sampler with a very similar composition to the present example composed of tent-stitch slips and animals above a group of geometric designs worked in silk and metal threads, is also in the Victoria and Albert Museum (inv. no. T.234-1928). Spot samplers were originally dated to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century, but more recently they have been reassigned to the mid-seventeenth century on the basis of a group of dated spot samplers that Carol Humphrey has brought to light. Spot samplers are relatively rare survivals compared to seventeenth century band samplers, which may result from their continuing usefulness as pattern references, a function that would have worn them out. The fact that these are rarely dated or signed may indicate that some are the work of professional teachers or embroiderers, in which case they would not have been treasured and saved by the descendants of the makers in the same way as ""schoolgirl"" accomplishments. Nevertheless, early in their existence they were certainly valued by the women who actually referred to them. The manner in which the maker of this sampler used materials and the fact that several individual motifs in this piece were left half-finished suggest that this is the first draft of a final work. Once the maker had mastered the technique and produced enough of the design to judge the final effect, there was no need to waste precious materials, particularly metal threads, and time in completing the motif.Geometric patterns similar to those found on this sampler were used on small purses and other decorative accessories; a cushion in the Colonial Williamsburg collection (inv. no. 1967-62), for example, is decorated with a similar diamond-shaped motif. It has been suggested that the tent-stitch motifs, or slips, on spot samplers were intended to be cut out and applied to another ground fabric for the production of valances, bed hangings, or cushion covers. It seems more likely that these were intended to be saved as design ideas rather than used in another end product. Surviving unused slips suggest that when these were worked in any quantity for use in appliqué, they were organized methodically in rows of identical motifs, rather than squeezed into the available space at different angles of orientation.[Emily Zilber, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

This graphic effect is particularly apparent in the brick stitch used as the ground in the border around the oval frame. It is unusual that the embroiderer has adopted the printmakers’ and painters’ convention of signing his work at the bottom of the image: ""R. Hayes Fecit."" This claim to professional status makes it likely that R. Hayes was indeed a professional embroiderer, and this is consistent with the evenness of stitching. It is most evident in the rendering of Charles’s flowing hair, where the embroiderer has articulated the graceful ringlets by twisting the silk floss at the tips of the gathered curl to create a play of light that closely approaches the nature of human hair.The embroidery is derived from a popular image of Charles I, which was made after his execution and exists in at least two prints: an engraving by Edward Bower, published by Robert Preeke in 1649, and an etching produced by Wenceslaus Hollar in the same year (MMA, 17.50.85). Although Yvonne Hackenbroch suggests the former as the direct print source for this embroidery, it is in fact closer to the Hollar version, in the exact transcription of the pose, in the king’s size and position relative to the oval surround, and in such details as the gloved hand and the cloak embroidered with the emblem of the Order of the Garter. John Peacock has posited that the Hollar portrait drew upon the painted portrait of Charles I Wearing the Garter Star of about 1632 by Anthony van Dyck and an ""idiosyncratic"" etching of Charles I by George Lid, published as a frontispiece of A Continuation of Lucan of 1630. From the former, he derived the general disposition of pose and details of costume, including the emblazoned Garter Star, and from the latter, the idea of showing the king wearing a broad-brimmed hat. That Charles wears the hat in several posthumous prints and in the embroidered portrait is a probable reference to his attire in court, when, as Hackenbroch pointed out, ""Charles declined to take his hat off during the trials lest this gesture be interpreted as a sign of respect towards his Judges."" In the embroidered portrait, this reference, combined with an aureole of light emanating from behind him, confers upon the image of the king both the specificity of an historical memory and an iconic aura appropriate to its commemorative function.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

It was part of the insignia of office of its custodian, the Keeper of the Great Seal (a post often contained within that of the Lord High Chancellor) and one of the most elaborate symbols associated with that high office. The king’s Great Seal was attached to all writs, letters patent, charters, and royal proclamations and was the ultimate symbol of royal authority. Something of the aura that attached to the physical object may be seen in the sense of responsibility its keepers felt in its safekeeping. When a Thomas Sadler broke into the house of the chancellor, Lord Finch, and stole the mace and burse on February 7, 1677, he failed to take the Great Seal itself, as Lord Finch kept it under his pillow.The present example dates from the reign of the first Hanoverian king, George I, and although the coat of arms would be particular to each monarch, the general form and decoration had been established earlier. A portrait of Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, dated 1579 and housed in a private collection, shows him with an embroidered burse heavy with metal thread on a red velvet ground, with the monarch’s coat of arms and initials, foliate borders, and applied tassels, which is the same in essence as the Hanoverian example. The burse of Elizabeth I’s last Lord Keeper of the Great Seal, Sir Thomas Egerton (appointed 1596–1603), which is today in the British Museum, is also centered by the queen’s coat of arms flanked by a lion and a Welsh dragon rampant, surmounted by the letters E.R. and bordered by scrolling foliage. This pattern was followed in succeeding examples, evident in the burse held by Sir Orlandus Bridgeman, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal between 1667 and 1672, in the engraving by William Faithorne. One of the ceremonial uses of the burse was to be carried in procession at shoulder height by the Lord High Chancellor preceding the monarch. The burse of Francis North, Baron Guildford (1637–1685), appointed Lord Chancellor and Keeper of the Great Seal in 1682, survives today in the Burrell Collection.Given its symbolic purpose, the burse was made from the finest and most precious of materials by royal embroiderers and therefore represents the pinnacle of professional embroidery of the period. As such, it displays a veritable catalogue of different uses of metal thread, couching techniques, and appliqué. These techniques are also to be found on heralds’ tabards, robes of state, and other greater and lesser articles of ceremony, and were used in varying levels of detail, relief, and material according to a judicious hierarchy of workmanship that was attached to works made for court ceremonial. The embroidery is almost sculptural in character. The applied raised work in high relief is well dispersed throughout the composition of the square bag, comprising the main decorative elements: the Royal Hanoverian coat of arms at the center, the lion and unicorn rampant on plinths, an orb at the bottom center, and winged putti’s heads punctuating the corners and middle of the sides of the border. All of these elements are composed of couched metal threads of varying width, tone, and form to create a variety of contrasting textures. The colors are concentrated around a palette of gold, silver, and crimson, traditionally associated with English royalty since the time of William the Conqueror (whose arms are included on the first half of the upper left quartering of the coat of arms on the burse, the ""three lions passant gardant or""). The texture achieved by virtue of tightly coiled silver purl in the unicorn’s muzzle or the sinuous undulating ribcage of the lion’s chest demonstrates the skill in manipulating metal threads to give the impression of the natural fall of groomed fur.The arms themselves are those of King George I. To the existing royal arms of the quartered fleurs-de-lis of France, rampant red lion of Scotland, lions passant of England, and harp of Ireland, the Hanoverian arms have been included in the lower left quadrant: two lions passant for Brunswick, harts and a blue lion rampant for Lüneburg, and a white or silver horse for Westphalia. Over this is a diminutive escutcheon with the crown of Charlemagne, an emblem associated with George I’s title as Arch-Treasurer of the Holy Roman Empire. In the course of his reign, George I appointed three Lord High Chancellors, and so there are three possible possessors of this burse: William Cowper, 1st Baron Talbot of Hensol (1714–18), Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke (1718–25), and Peter King, 1st Baron King (1725–33). The extravagant three-dimensionality of the burse shows the continued flourishing of professional embroidery at court into the eighteenth century.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]","Embroidery"

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to enter this market, but most surviving Gujarati embroideries relate to trade with England, which increased in the early seventeenth century.¹ Over the course of the seventeenth century, as the Gujarati embroiderers adjusted their output for the English market, they adopted the common motif of pink flowers detailed in yellow that bloom from dark green vines with light green or yellow veins. In the background are spotted leopards, striped deer, squirrels, birds, and other chain-stitched beasts filled with bands of color or details in contrasting hues. These elements are understood to have been culled from a variety of sources including English embroideries, examples of which must have been sent to India as models (see e.g. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, nos. 53.2202 and 53.172). But as English embroidery was itself responding to the influx of Asian textiles, incorporating and adapting many foreign motifs, the result was a mix of European, Indian, and Chinese imagery that then fed back to its original sources in a totally transformed state. This piece, consisting of several panels that have been joined and then quilted to form a bed-size coverlet, includes the motifs found on seventeenth-century coverlets but must have been made in the early eighteenth century, when an overall pattern of rinceaux enclosing flowers became more common.² However, Gujarati production is remarkable for its variety; at the same time, embroiderers were also producing patterns related to French bizarre silks and palampore designs (see e.g. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, no. 57.168).

The 1601 inventory of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury (1527—1608), included two quilts that were almost certainly products of this trade: ""a quilt of yellow India stuff embroidered with birds and beasts"" and ""a quilt of India stuff embroidered with beastes.""¹ Indian quilts of the type produced for the Portuguese market appeared with increasing frequency in London sales into the 1620s, when their value began to decline, perhaps because of diminishing novelty.²The taste for Indian-style embroidery remained, however, and it is interesting to note that the English maker of another bedcover in the Museum's collection (MMA 34.104.1) used not only the Indian palette of golden yellow on white but also an imported Indian cotton as the foundation. The cover has rare seventeenth-century marks on the plain-weave cotton fabric: the initials G.C.E. (for the English East India Company's original name, The Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies) as well as three other stamps whose significance has not yet been deciphered.³ On that bedcover, the embroidered designs draw heavily on such exotic motifs as pineapple-like vegetation and serrated leaves, but contemporary European sensibilities are also evident in the strapwork connecting the floral elements. Additionally, the three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the use of stitches with long floats that create a shinier surface to contrast with the matte appearance of the cotton ground diverge from the Indian prototypes, whose flatter chain stitches are less glossy. English bedcovers were usually part of coordinated sets that could include bolsters, pillows, and matching valances.⁴In addition to the more common monochrome yellow-on white embroideries, Indian polychrome embroideries also arrived in England during the early seventeenth century. They, too, are described in sale records; for example, a 1614 sale included ""a carpet or quilt embroidered upon calico with sundry silks.""⁵ The word ""carpet"" is probably used in its contemporaneous sense, that is, to signify decorative covers for a variety of furniture types, including beds. This textile, an English polychrome silk and metal-thread bedcover, is more obviously dependent on the stylistic composition of Persian and Turkish carpets than MMA 34.104.1.  By the eighteenth century, both embroidered and painted cotton textiles of this type, with a central medallion and smaller medallions in the corners of the central field, were being made in India for domestic consumption and for export (see e.g. Winterthur Museum no. 1963.0048 and Victoria and Albert Museum no. IS.46-1956).⁶ These imported polychrome covers had a lasting influence on the production of English embroidered bed furnishings of the eighteenth century.

In the early seventeenth century they also fetched high prices at auctions in England and seem to have influenced the production of embroidery there (see MMA 34.104.1 and MMA 1970.173). Characterized by the use of yellow tussah silk embroidery on a white cotton ground, they typically depict a combination of classical, biblical, and Hindu themes, although a few draw from other sources (see e.g. Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, no. T20e4). This colcha is embellished with a selection of vignettes found on several others, including an almost identical example in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon.² Successive bands around the border depict a hunt, the Labors of Hercules, and the story of Arion, while the center panel features the Judgment of Solomon surrounded by stories from the book of Judith: the siege of Bethulia (bottom right), Judith before Holofernes (top right), Judith beheads Holofernes (top left), and the severed head of Holofernes displayed from the walls of Bethulia (bottom left). Vignettes from classical mythology include Actaeon transformed into a stag by Diana (above the Solomon scene), Hercules shooting the Lernean Hydra (detail), and the story of Phaeton, who drove the chariot of the sun too close to Earth, scorching the planet and causing the animals to die (in the triangular panel below Hercules). While the themes of these coverlets can be generally related to contemporary European tapestries and textiles, which also mix biblical and classical tales, the depiction of the protagonists in seventeenth-century Portuguese garb and the addition of Hindu imagery (such as the story of the Vishnu avatar Matsya, the fishtailed figure in the second band from the center) must represent the traditions and imagination of the embroiderers who created them. The circulation of northern European prints and illustrated Bibles at the Mughal court is well documented, but the sources available to the Bengali embroiderers remain obscure and probably represent an entirely different category of material. The inventiveness of the embroidery is further underscored by comparison to those made for the local market. Two pieces that likely date to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century are embroidered in multicolored silk, and their design is composed of circular medallions enclosing lotus patterns, interlocking star shapes, and bands of human figures and animals.³ Here, then, the switch to an almost monochrome yellow and white palette, the composition of concentric panels and bands, and the addition of foreign iconography were innovations for this particular type of export, which was produced only until the mid-seventeenth century.

The men wear breeches and doublets, whose style and cut generally conform to late sixteenth- and early seventeenth century European dress.¹ Yet these Western garments, depicted with detailed embroidery, bear certain characteristic Chinese motifs: one man has a dragon design on his doublet, while another’s costume shows a typically Asian auspicious motif of intersecting diamonds within a diagonal lattice. In addition, the men’s features—including wispy mustaches and beards—have an Asian character. While the embroiderer may have intended to represent Portuguese gentlemen, there is a certain mixing of imagery and types here that is seen in other decorative arts of the period that depict foreigners, such as the painted Japanese Namban screens showing the ""barbarians"" arriving in Japan.²The basic design of the coverlet, which at some point was lined in a vibrant clamp resist-dyed silk from India (MMA 1975.208a-c), consists of a central roundel in a field surrounded by one or more borders; although this layout is frequently seen in works made for export, it also appears in domestic Chinese kang (daybed) covers.³ Its imagery—including dragons flanking a flaming jewel, the birds and flowers of the border, and the Chinese-style lions in each corner—is common in Chinese textiles. Some of the details, however, are unusual, or are combined in unexpected ways, suggesting the involvement of a European trader or client unfamiliar with the selection and placement of motifs in Chinese iconography. The jewel between the dragons, for example, is uniformly surrounded by flames, resembling a Western sun more than the characteristic Asian flaming jewel. And the lotus pond at one edge of the border, which would normally be the backdrop for pairs of waterfowl, such as ducks or egrets,⁴ instead features large pheasants, more often depicted in a dry, rocky setting.

A quintessential account in the Western classical tradition, the story of the Trojan War inspired large sets of European tapestries; the earliest documented set was presented to Charles the Bold in 1472.¹ This embroidered hanging, too, was part of a large set, of which the Metropolitan Museum owns three, and four are preserved in other collections.² All have the same border, including an armorial at each corner that does not correspond completely with any known arms. Perhaps it is an erroneous rendering of the arms of the Mascarenhas family of Portugal; the nobleman Francisco Mascarenhas served as governor of Macau from 1623 to 1626. The abduction of Helen ignited war between Troy and Greece; this version, in which Helen is forcibly seized, relies on postclassical sources.³ Against a backdrop of European-style buildings with Baroque facades and struggling armored figures, a protesting Helen is carried off by two men, away from her white-bearded husband, Menelaus, and toward a boat on the right where the Trojan prince Paris awaits. No single print source has yet been found, but the subject matter and composition of the hanging were surely based on European sources.⁴The Chinese embroiderers were responsible for many details from the Chinese decorative vocabulary, such as the waves in the background, the phoenixes in the center of the upper border, various details of the armor, the scales of the serpents and tritons in the border, and the lychee fruit seen outlined against the side of the boat. While most of the hanging is embroidered, the figures’ faces and exposed limbs were painted directly on the cotton foundation cloth, probably also in China. Especially in the faces, the modeling of light and shadow for a three-dimensional effect, while naively done, shows an aspect of European-style painting that had reached East Asia with Jesuit missionaries in the sixteenth century. The Italian Jesuit Giovanni Niccolo (or Nicolao, 1563–1626) established an academy of painting in Japan in 1583 to train local artists to produce religious art. When the missionaries’ relations with Japanese authorities deteriorated, Niccolo fled Japan, returning to Macau in 1614. Some of his students became active in China, including You Wenhui (baptized Manoel Pereira, 1575–1633), a young Chinese from Macau, and Ni Yicheng (also known as Jacopo Niva, 1579–1635), of Japanese and Chinese parentage. You Wenhui produced the only surviving painted portrait of the Jesuit leader Matteo Ricci (1552–1610).⁵ The more highly regarded Ni Yicheng had studied at Niccolo’s academy in Japan, and in China he ""was in constant demand to paint works . . . both for the mission in China and the Jesuits’ church in Macau.""⁶ Perhaps these artists or less well-documented colleagues were responsible for painting this textile.  Scientific analysis of the hanging’s pigments supports this intercultural possibility: results show a blue-green pigment not used in Asia and a white not used in Europe. Furthermore, the white pigment occurs more frequently in Japanese than in Chinese contexts.⁷[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1.

The chasuble's embroidered decoration-a nearly symmetrical pattern of full-blown, seminaturalistic flowers, small blossoms, curving leaves, and scrolls—is an excellent example of the style of late Baroque ornament used to embellish Italian vestments from the end of the seventeenth century to the middle years of the eighteenth. The robust flowers, worked in long and short stitches, French knots, and metallic loops, are carefully modeled in four to five shades of silk. The metallic thread is primarily used in laid and couched work, cursively following the contours of the motifs and secured in twill or chevron patterns with yellow silk. Although it is often impossible to identify the specific place of manufacture of such embroideries, documentation accompanying this gift proposes western Sicily. Attestations given in 1915 in Partanna and Mazara del Vallo state that according to tradition this set of vestments was a gift to Nicolo Spedaliere (also recorded as Spitaleri), head priest of the mother church of Partanna, from his bishop. Furthermore, the superior of the Collegia di Maria, which was founded in 1681 in Mazara del Vallo, avers that since that time schools and women's religious orders have existed throughout the diocese in which embroidery like this example as well as other types were practiced.","Embroidery"

Later, the precious bedcover was cut up, and portions were pieced together with a delicate quilted European floral silk to create the panel as it appears today.¹ Its relatively small size indicates that it may have served as a christening or bearing cloth for a child being carried to the baptismal font for christening.²  At the very center of the textile are three bands from the original coverlet, one with a roundel containing a scene of a man and a woman flanking a tree, perhaps inspired by traditional depictions of Adam and Eve. The blossoming tree grows from a large container decorated with a continuous pattern of hexagons, a Chinese design suggesting longevity, and on the tree is a bleeding heart pierced with arrows, a secular symbol referring to love and devotion in Renaissance Europe.³ The dress of the couple is generally consistent with that of late sixteenth to early seventeenth century Europe: the woman’s unstructured clothing is typical of the early seventeenth century, while the man’s hat conforms to late sixteenth-century examples.⁴ Their garments are overembroidered with repeating Chinese patterns, as if made to resemble Chinese silk damasks. The two other adjoining bands at the center of the panel were formerly one. If placed one directly above the other, they form a scene with a pair of ducks in a lotus pond. Although the lotus pond is an enduring theme in Chinese textiles, here the pattern shows a heightened emphasis on flower centers, common in Chinese export textiles, and another type of duck has been substituted for the pair of egrets or mandarin ducks more frequently found in a traditional Chinese image. Another part of the original coverlet was retained as the embroidered border of the present panel; while its sides were heavily pieced together, the ninety-degree corners were untouched in the piecing process, indicating that it served as a border in the original coverlet as well. The delicate, light peach-colored European textile chosen to surround the exotic portions of the cloth has a floral pattern typical of the last decades of the seventeenth century.⁵ The panel is fully lined in a white monochrome woven silk with a small floral pattern on a continuous fretwork background likely woven in China. Cloth of this type, termed rinzu, was exported from China to Japan in large quantities during the seventeenth century to be used as the foundation fabric of luxurious dyed and embroidered Japanese kimonos, until the Japanese started producing it themselves in the mid-Edo period, starting in the 1680s.⁶[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1.

Its slender, A-line shape was common in chasubles of eighteenth-century Spain, where it may have been used.¹ The focal point of the embroidered design is the roundel with a double-headed eagle at the center of the vestment’s front and back. Although the double-headed eagle surmounted by a crown was a symbol of the Habsburg monarchy, here it is purely decorative and tinged with an auspicious Chinese flavor.² Instead of grasping arrows in their talons, as they would in the Habsburg motif, the birds dangle flowering and leafy stems from their beaks. In Chinese textiles auspicious birds frequently hold symbolic flora: a rank badge in the Metropolitan Museum’s collection features a crane that grips a branch bearing both a peach and a peach blossom.³ The front and back of the chasuble are each divided into three vertical sections, separated by narrow embroidered floral trim that also borders the neck and edges.⁴ The central section consists of a series of vertically aligned roundels, floral rosettes, and geometrically decorated vessels resting on stands amid a simple ogival pattern of flowering vines. On each of the two side sections, a graceful design of delicately curving leafy stems emerges from a multicolored cornucopia, a long-standing European motif. Cornucopias are included in at least two other eighteenth-century chasubles embroidered in China, one now in the Metropolitan and the other in the Museo Nacional del Virreinato, Tepotzotlan, Mexico, and formerly in the Catedral de Mexico—a reminder that there were markets besides Europe for chasubles embroidered in China.⁵ The scrolling pattern of the side panels is punctuated with large flowers, some of which include elements from Chinese decorative arts and others that are unusual from a Chinese perspective—even quite fantastic. The large flowers close to the cornucopias on the front of the garment and flanking the eagle roundel on the back are rather unrefined in technique, featuring dots on their radiating petals and a bold red, white, yellow, and blue coloration that lacks the more subtle shades of light red seen in the smaller flowers nearby, a customary coloration in Chinese embroidery. As dotted petals are fairly common in Indian floral textiles of the eighteenth century but unusual in Chinese examples, these bold flowers and other similarly distinctive blooms may reflect the Chinese embroiderer’s attempt to mimic the Indian floral patterns that were so popular in international trade.

The panels were woven by Camille Pernon, premier producer of luxury silks in Lyon. The central embroidered landscapes, based on paintings of the countryside surrounding Arunjuez, were probably applied after the panels were delivered to Spain.Dugourc, who was raised at Versailles, was named dessinateur du Garde-Meuble de la Couronne in 1784. From 1786 he also worked for the decoration of a number of rooms at the Casita del Labrador. These panels are a strong statement of his eclectic use of motifs, in this case taken from Raphael's decorations for the Vatican Loggia, which were in turn inspired by Roman wall paintings.

To find an old-fashioned border design on a practical object like this work bag is unusual. Yet the detached motifs in the carefully organized yet lively design - human figures; native plants and flowers, including strawberries, acorns and honeysuckle; heraldic animals such as lions, leopards, and stags; and more prosaic creatures such as birds and caterpillars - are typical of those found on English embroidered textiles throughout this era.","Embroidery"

Those who could not afford a cabinet mounted with imported Asian lacquer panels or a suite of tapestries like those produced by John Vanderbank (see MMA 53.165.2) could still satisfy their taste by wearing a petticoat or other fashionable accessory decorated with exotic motifs. In 1688 John Stalker and George Parker published A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing, which includes twenty-four copperplate designs that could be used to decorate a variety of objects (see MMA 32.80.2). This book also gives detailed instructions on how to create imitation lacquer, or japanning, on various household objects. The text shows a lack of specificity regarding culture and geography that was typical of the period. For example, in their preface, the authors sing the praises of Japan and its architecture, but in the instructions the reader is advised ""that if you would exactly imitate and copie [sic] out the Japan [design for imitation lacquer]"" one should look to ""the true Indian work"" where they ""never crowd up their ground with many Figures, Houses, or Trees, but allow great space to little work.""¹There are extant English mirrors that retain their original ""Japanned"" frames, as well as American furniture decorated with motifs from works like A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing.² However, such books inspired more than just imitation lacquer on furniture.

The embroidery stitches employed- darning and running stitches- are technically very simple, but the skill with which they are executed and the harmonious use of color suggest the work of a professional in the workshop of Morris & Co.","Embroidery"

Wool could easily be dyed with the natural dyes of the period in a wide array of vivid colors. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, one of the most popular forms was variations on the Tree of Life motif, inspired by the colorful painted cotton palampores of the same design that were imported into Britain. This pair of bed curtain panels is exceptional for its unusual design, which is more closely related to woven silk textiles of the period. On this grand scale, the leaves also hark back to late medieval decorative cabbage-leaf verdure tapestries. The blue and white palette of the embroidery certainly reflects the immense popularity of the Chinese export and Dutch Delft ceramics that were avidly collected in Britain.These curtain panels would have formed part of a set of hangings, which would have also upper and lower valances, a head cloth, a bed cover or counterpane and wider curtains that would enclose the entire bed when drawn. As the hanging curtains often saw the least amount of physical wear, these are often the elements that survive from a matched set. In addition, the remainder of the textile furnishing in such a bedroom would have coordinated with the bed hangings: seat furniture covers, window curtains and possibly wall hangings.","Embroidery"

The import of decorated cottons from India was illegal at this time, but this did nothing to stem the demand. Both men and women negotiated directly with smugglers to acquire them.

They would have been created for a fashionable middling or aristocratic household. The original use of the word ‘chintz’ was for Indian cotton cloth on which a pattern was produced by hand-drawing and dyeing with mordants and resists. While there was immense enthusiasm for chintz among British consumers in the late seventeenth century, there were also many opponents to the imported Indian goods, including the weavers of wool, linen and silk. In a bid to protect British manufacturing, a law was passed in 1701 to forbid the import of dyed or printed cottons and silk from India into Britain, except for re-export. Despite this ban, the overwhelming fashion for these light, colourful textiles led the writer Daniel Defoe to comment that it had ‘crept into our houses; our closets and bedchambers, curtains, cushions, chairs and at last beds themselves were nothing but calicoes and Indian stuffs, and in short almost everything that used to be made of wool and silk’. 

According to a diary written by a the donor’s ancestor (Baptist Noel Turner, 1739–1826), these hangings belonged to Elizabeth and Christiana Willes, and were said to have been made for their house on the Bedford School Estate, London. The Bedford School Estate was around 13 acres (5.2 hectares) of land in the parish of St Andrew, Holborn, London. Proceeds from the estate funded the Bedford School, and were also given as alms to the poor and to aid the marriage of poor women. Although difficult to prove, such narratives suggest how the histories handed down with each intricately pieced patchwork are often as  cherished as the cottons and silks that document its textile history.","Embroidery"

Worked in the pattern now known as 'clamshell' or 'shells'.  The hangings include two large foot curtains, two small head curtains, a lower valence in three parts and an upper valence. There is no surviving headcloth or coverlet. The fabrics are both dress and furnishing, and are decorated in a variety of techniques, including block-printing, painting, resist-dyeing, stencilling and embroidery. Each of the patches has a linen template and reverse. These individual patches are worked into a larger pattern of scalloped-edged diamonds outlined in green silk tape. The repetition of prints within each diamond is completely symmetrical. Although many of the prints appear to be similar, most have been used exclusively within one diamond, meaning that there is very little duplication. Each of the large curtains had 1960 pieces and each of the smaller curtains has 784. The right and left lower valences have approximately 196 each, and the foot valence approximately 172. The upper valance has 368. Each object is lined with linen and edged in a green, white and yellow silk braid. The foot curtains still have their original brass hoops and linen tapes. There is evidence that the upper valence would have been secured by tacking it to the bed with nails, as small holes can be seen at the upper edge. The lower valences are secured with silk braid ties at the upper left and right of each valence.","Embroidery"

The most enduring method in Britain is known as 'piecing over paper', where the pattern is first drawn onto paper and then accurately cut. Small pieces of fabric are then tacked round each of the shapes, before being joined together from the back using overstitch. However, in this example, each of the patches has been pieced over printed or plain linen, before being individually lined with linen. This process would have been very labour-intensive. The huge number of textiles and accuracy of the stitching supports the idea that the hangings may have been worked professionally. Over 6,400 pieces have been stitched together.

In 18th century Britain, the bedrooms of the wealthy were used for the display of luxury goods. They were a place where family members rested, servants entered and guests were entertained. Ornamental patchwork hangings reflected a household's access to a range of fashionable textiles.

Suitably lavish textiles could often be hard to come by. These hangings incorporate both British and Indian cottons.

This embroidered panel would have belonged to a set of three valances, their purpose to adorn the head of a bed, obscuring the pole and rungs of the bed curtains. Embroidered with brightly coloured wools and silks, valances provided a means of decorative insulation from the draughts, cold and humidity that plagued sixteenth-century houses. 

Beds and their textiles figure prominently in inventories of effects from the Renaissance, an indication of how greatly they were valued. Those individuals who were of high rank, conveyed their position to their contemporaries through conspicuous consumption, with a lavish display of costly textiles.

<i>Embroidery</i> 
The valance is embroidered entirely in petit-point, the French name for tent stitch (also known as half stitch), which enjoyed a period of great popularity in the last few decades of the sixteenth century. Despite being a relatively simple stitch, which enabled the embroiderer to cover large areas of ground comparatively quickly, petit-point nevertheless aspired to the same elevated status as tapestry and was distinguished from other stitches by its classification as needlework tapestry (<i>la tapisserie à l'aiguille</i>). By virtue of its simplicity, petit point was practised by amateur and professional embroiderer alike. The stitch lent itself well to naturalistic motifs and bold, albeit somewhat geometric compositions. This valance would most likely have been worked by a woman of noble birth; embroidery was held to be an essential skill for any accomplished woman of aristocratic rank. However, due to the size and complexity of the composition, the possiblility remains that it may have been executed by a professional embroiderer, who may have been employed as part of the household. 

<i>Subject</i> 
The Garden of Love, identifiable here by the prominent fountain of Cupid, shown with his quiver, raising a single arrow in the air, was a common parable in the Renaissance ornamental repertoire, characterised by its idyllic landscape and the languid couples who people it. The garden served not just as a suitable and decorative site for courtship, but as a visual metaphor for love itself. This was a device frequently employed in the decoration of Italian furniture, most commonly employed for objects commissioned as wedding gifts. Thus, allegorical depictions of love on valances such as this one, reinforced to the viewer both the role and status of the bed and the part it played in the conjugal relations that were pivotal to the continuation of a family's lineage. The enduring theme of love vanquishing aggression, as depicted on this valance, was a subject entirely suitable to the the context of the bedroom.

Three female figures in french court dress are positioned on the right: one of them is seated, one standing and one rising from a seated position with her arm outstretched, pointing to the standing female and kneeling male figures who are the focal point of the scene. Three men dressed as warriors are positioned on the left; they wear cuirasses and plumed helmets. The male figure farthest to the left carries a white banner; the man in the centre stands sentry-like holding a shield and a spear; and the last and most elaborately dressed figure is kneeling on the ground, his sword and shield cast aside. 

The subject of the valance is Mars (Roman God of War) and Venus (Roman Goddess of Love) in the Garden of Love. In this scene, Mars has laid his weapons aside and is kneeling in supplication to Venus, with both deities flanked on either side by their attendants. This symbolic act represents Love vanquishing Aggression. Venus, clearly delighting in her triumph, turns towards her attendants, casting an imperious backward glance at her suitor. As if to reinforce further the humbling of the God of War, a nearby squirrel mimics Mars's pose. This scene of courtship takes place in palace grounds with an abundance of flowers, trees and shrubbery, against a backdrop of an architectural landscape, through which flows a river. Animals are interspersed throughout the landscape, including a dove, a pigeon, a squirrel, rabbits, swans and snails.

This valance is worked entirely in tent stitch, a term that is derived from the French word 'tendre', meaning to stretch or extend. This was a reference to the stretching of the canvas on which the embroidery would be worked. French embroiderers, however, employed a different term for the stitch, calling it <i>petit point</i>, or 'little stitch'. 

The lively scene depicted here is that of the mythological union of Mars and Venus in the Garden of Love.

A dragon is below them, and trees, plants, animals, and birds fill the rest of the space.

The canvas has been partly worked in tent stitch in silks and wools, with parts of the figures and dragon highly finished, and single stitches in other areas to indicate colours to be worked. Pinholes are visible along the vertical selvages of the canvas panel, probably a result of it being attached to a frame to be worked on.","Embroidery"

The whole design appears to have been drawn directly onto the canvas using black ink, providing a clear guide to the embroiderer. The panel has, in addition to the areas worked, coloured threads put in loosely as colour coding in the clothing of the figures, who are depicted in an approximation of Turkish dress. 
		
The mixture of Chinese and Turkish ornament is typical of the random juxtaposition of such elements in European decorative art in the early 18th century, but may have been particularly influenced by the arrival at the French court in 1721 of the first ambassador from the Ottoman Empire to be received there, and the consequent enthusiasm in France for what was perceived as Turkish style. Turquerie began to appear not only in fashion, interiors and painting but also entered the realms of literature, theatre and opera. Both of the figures here have a pale complexion, suggesting they are perhaps Europeans in fancy dress, although the clothing of the female figure is based on the 17th century French artist Henri Bonnart's print <i>La Grande Sultane.</i>

The amalgamation of real and mythical animals suggests a portrayal of a fantastical foreign land, which is amplified by the fanciful use of scale and unusual details:
In the upper-left of the panel is an inaccurate, or ‘fantastical’, depiction of a flying bird with a tail of three peacock feathers. The winged dragon, or serpent, in the centre of the design has been depicted with only two legs to walk upon and the lion in the bottom-right corner appears to be the size of a small dog when compared to this and the surrounding foliage. What appear to be three lambs or sheep (with undocked tails) are shown lying to the left of the design, watched over by a collared dog of a smaller size. If viewed as being sheep, this grouping is suggestive of pastoral scenes, which were also fashionable at the time. However, the lack of detail available could allow them to also be interpretted as a group of mythical, scaled, dog-like creatures.

The tree in the centre of the design is similar to a date palm, but the simple outlines and varying scaling of the other plants and flowers prevent identification –it is probable that many of them are simply aesthetically pleasing approximations or imagined creations.

Pinholes are visible along the vertical selvages of the canvas panel, most likely as a result of it being attached to a frame to be worked on. The embroidery has been worked in tent stitch which is one of the most basic yet versatile stitches in canvas work embroidery. The intended purpose or method of display for the completed embroidery is unknown but the size of the panel suggests that it could have been mounted as decoration for a fire screen.","Embroidery"

While the shape and construction are entirely in keeping with that of the panels on Spanish style dalmatics, the pattern of holes down the side of the piece suggest it may have been used as upholstery. Spanish chairs of the 16th century had backs and seats of a similar size to this panel (unlike Italian chairs which had rather narrower backs, as a rule). The pattern of darning suggests friction on the lower edge of the panel, and would be in keeping with wear and tear inflicted by a seated body. The grotesque style of pattern is not unknown on dalmatic accessories, as there are collars in our collection which have such motifs, however, it is strange that there is no obvious reference in the imagery to the Church or its saints.

As an apparel panel, the object belonged to a set of church ornaments and probably fulfilled the function of a panel on a dalmatic (the priestly garment worn by deacons). The Spanish style of dalmatic had matching apparels on the front, back and sleeves, those on the body being substantially larger (squarer) than those on the sleeves (rectangles). Usually, those on the body of the garment were attached between the waist and the hemline, those on the sleeves towards the edge with the imagery clearly visible when the arm was at rest by the wearer's side. (Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds: Maney, 2002, p.142). A second panel in this collection matches this one, and would have adorned the other side of the skirt.

If used for religious purposes, this panel is significant as an example of the pre Council of Trent (1545-63) design on church ornaments. While the Council's impact on sculpture and painting is well covered in existing literature on the plastic arts, its interpretation in textiles has largely remained hidden within specialist textile histories. 

The creation of embroidery and the learning of embroidery skills followed a similar path to that of sculpture and painting, and recently serious research has begun on its professional development in certain local centres in Spain (e.g. Marta Laguardia's work on Salamanca). Basically, skills were learnt through apprenticeship in a guild and groups of objects were made according to similar specifications (e.g. the workshop of the sculptor Gregorio Fernandez or that of the painter Francisco Zurbaran). Successful execution of standard imagery was valued (where today 'creativity' and 'originality' are highly prized). In some cases, embroidery was learnt in convents and nuns were skilled needlewomen who could make church ornaments.

A number of sixteenth and seventeenth century dalmatic collars and apparels survive in the V&A collection, divorced from their original garment (about 64). It seems likely that panels from dalmatics may have survived intact longer than other parts of the dalmatic which may have become damaged during church services or been recycled at a later date. In addition, collectors in later centuries tended to be more interested in patterned textiles or textiles with particularly painterly imagery rather than the plain silks or silks with repeating patterns that were used for the basic body of vestments.

As a furnishing, it could have been used either in the sixteenth century or as part of a 19th century revival of such styles of furniture. It is particularly rich in terms of its visual impact and its metallic threads, and would therefore be most suitable for royal furnishings (a chair such as that on which Mary Tudor sits in the Eworth portrait of about 1550, thought to have been painted for her betrothal to Philip II of Spain). Sixteenth or seventeenth-century dalmatic apparels have been used as upholstery on a simple chair of the type that was popular as a historical revival in the late nineteenth century, now in the Lehman collection. The seat backs demonstrate a desire for the opulent, decorative qualities of the embroidery rather than its iconographical content, as the design has been applied on its side rather than so that it is 'readable'.

Its shape and construction suggest that it may at one time have been attached to a dalmatic, the tunic-like garment worn by deacons of the Catholic Church. However, the pattern of holes down the side of the piece suggests it may have been used as upholstery, either in the period in which it was made or afterwards in the 19th century.

<b>Decoration &amp; Design </b>
Satin worked with silk thread. The panels are edged with silver braid. The casket has handles on either side  and is missing feet. 

The panels are all decorated in biblical scenes. The top depicts Rebekah at the Well giving Eliezer a drink, the left  door shows Eliezer taking leave of Abraham and the right shows him journeying, leading a camel. On the right side  Eliezer is shown meeting Laban and Rebekah, on the back Eliezer leads Rebekah on a camel, and on the left side is  the meeting of Issac and Rebekah. The sides of the lid are decorated with insects, animals and flowers. 

The interior is lined with pink silk and the front of the drawers are covered with pink silk velvet. The edges of the  compartment and the mirror surround are painted purple and stamped with silver. The drawers are edged with silver  braid.

Construction
The casket is rectangular, the lid hinges upwards and has a space for a mirror. The main compartment has multiple  smaller compartments including a mirrored compartment set with a print. 
The base of the casket has one long drawer surmounted by 3 smaller drawers. Thre further drawers can be found  behind the top panel, which can be removed by turning the key and lifting at the same time.","Embroidery"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/f622068f-5769-3c8f-83cc-fcc29fd9ba9f","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","This casket came originally from the Smart family of Norcott Hall, Hertfordshire. Family history associates it with a visit to the house by Charles II. It passed by inheritance to Elizabeth Smart, who married John Loxley in the 19th century. 

The embroidery on the casket is in exceptionally fine condition. The casket has come to the museum with its wooden protective case, lined with marbled paper, and a pink silk slip cover, made to protect the delicate surfaces of the embroidery. Together these have helped to preserve it from damage and the fading of its fresh colours.

The panels of the casket would have been worked by a young girl, of about the age of 11 or 12, as the culmination of her needlework education, which would have begun with samplers, and the decoration of small objects like pin cushions. She would embroider a series of small panels drawn or printed with pictorial scenes, which would then be sent to a cabinet maker to be made up into a casket, the edges bound with braid. The caskets were fitted with a variety of drawers and compartments, suitable for keeping jewellery, writing equipment and letters, needlework tools, tiny toys or keepsakes. They often had one or two secret drawers, for their young owners' most precious or private possessions; this casket has five, concealed with considerable ingenuity.

Biblical scenes were the most common choice for this type of embroidery, and this example has episodes from the story of Tobias and the Archangel Raphael round some of its sides, with Rebecca and Elizir on the lid. Rebecca may be an Old Testament heroine, but the young girl who embroidered her image here has brought her right up to date, dressing her in the high heels, lace collar and elaborate ringlets of a Stuart lady.","Embroidery"

Plain sewing - hemming and seaming - was of particular value for the production of underclothes and basic household linens.  Only a privileged few, however, were able to afford the time and materials for embroidery.  There appear to have been a number of accepted markers in the development of a competent needlewoman.  First a band sampler was completed, illustrating the range of stitches and techniques that the girl had mastered.  Then these skills were developed by sewing a more complex and demanding cut-work sampler.  In many cases the final challenge was the production of an embroidered picture like this one, depicting scenes from myth or the Bible using a wide range of stitches and materials.  In particular these pictures employ raised work, the technique of embroidering over padding.

It is probable that each individual figure or element was sewn independently and then applied to the delicate white satin background.  This meant that the needlewoman could experiment and correct mistakes which would be impossible to rework on the satin.  
This picture, almost certainly derived from a contemporary print, tells the Old Testament story of Esther and Ahasuerus.  In the centre of the embroidery, Esther, the Jewish wife of the Persian king Ahasuerus warns her husband of a plot by his prime minister Haman to kill all the Jews in his realm.  Ahasuerus gestures with his sceptre while Esther holds out a scroll inscribed 'At my petition'.  The resulting execution of Haman is depicted in the top left corner of the embroidery.  The picture is marked in ink with the initials MI and the date 1665 below the central scene.","Embroidery"

By the thirteenth century clerical attire was more or less stabilized throughout the Latin Christian church. According to the <i>Rationale for the Divine Offices</i> of the canonist and liturgist William Durandus (d. 1296), all ranks of the higher clergy were entitled to wear the cope (or <i>pluviale</i>) for processional occasions on feast days. As a result, inventories of monastic churches testify to the existence of a very large number of copes, Canterbury, for example, owning no fewer than sixty copes in 1315. (Dyan Elliot, 'Dressing and Undressing the Clergy',  in E. Jane Burns ed. <i>Medieval Fabrications. Dress, Textiles, Cloth, and Other Cultural Imaginings</i>. London, 2004, pp. 56-58; Pauline Johnstone. <i>High Fashion in the Church</i>. Leeds, 2002, p. 11.)

The cope had developed from the same Roman garment (<i>paenula</i>) as had the chasuble, but by the eleventh century had a different form: it was semi-circular and open down the front; the front opening fastened just below the neck across the chest with a short strip of embroidered material or a morse (a metal clasp); orphrey bands ran the full length of the front opening and on the back, the cope retained a vestigial hood which was triangular or shield-shaped (as in this example). (Johnstone, op.cit.) The cope was so voluminous that its rich materials lent themselves to recycling for other purposes. There are many surviving examples of chasubles and dalmatics made of this kind of silk velvet, but fewer examples of full copes, some of which may have been cut down into other less voluminous vestments. Christa Mayer-Thurman illustrates and describes similar velvet copes or pieces of cope in different liturgical colours (green, purple, blue and red) in <i>European Textiles. The Robert Lehman Collection</i>, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York and Princeton University Press, Princeton, 2001, pp. 74-87; Donald King illustrates and describes part of a red velvet cope from Italy or Spain in <i>European Textiles in the Keir Collection 400BC to 1800AD</i>, London, 1990, cat. 49, p. 76.

<i>Iconography</i>. 
The saints depicted in the orphrey bands probably connect the cope to a Cologne church, or at least a church nearby - and their identity is reinforced by the lettering below their image and attributes. Two of them, St Ursula and St Severinus were Cologne saints. Severinus was not very popular elsewhere. St Hubert seems to have been the dedicatee of a military order established by the Archbishops-Elector of Cologne and was frequently represented in the Cologne area. See Conversion and Mass of St Hubert panels in National Gallery (Glyn Davies). The composition of the Death of the Virgin on the hood is likely to relate closely to imagery in paintings of the period. The depiction of the figures suggests that the scene is based on the Apocryphal Gospel, in particular the passage narrating the moment of the Virgin's death, surrounded by eleven of the Apostles (according to that source, St. Thomas was preaching in remote countries and did not return in time). Here there are, however, twelve apostles, John being the youngest and represented as such, beardless. The symbols that are difficult to make out in the embroidery, because of wear, are probably the palm, All Souls Book, censer and candles.

<i>Textile</i>. Silk velvets of this type were woven in centres in Italy and Spain during the fifteenth and sixteenth century. They were often called 'ferronerie' velvets because the effect created is similar to that of ironwork. They ranked among the most expensive luxury textiles of the time.

Dye analysis, carried out at the Institut Royal du Patrimoine Artistique in Brussels in 2007 by Inge Vanden Berghe, identified the red dyestuffs as insect red and tannin (gallnuts), with a trace of red wood. Her conclusion was that the red velvet was dyed with precious red insect dyes: Polish cochineal alone, or a combination of the very expensive kermes with Armenian cochineal. All three dyes sources were in use in Europe in the fifteenth century. According to the study done by Hofenk de Graaf on red dye sources used between 1450  and 1600 (based on TLC analysis), Polish cochineal was often found in Italian silks, whereas often Armenian cochineal or kermes were detected in red fifteenth century silks with a Spanish origin. She also notes that the use of gallnut for silk weighting, in the case of a later dyeing of light colours as scarlet and crimson shades, was most likely in fifteenth century Spain. (Judith H. Hofenk de Graaff. <i>The Colourful past: origins, chemistry and identification of natural dyesfuffs</i>. Abegg-Stiftung and Archetype publications ltd., 2004, esp. pp. 62 and 68).

<i>Embroidery</i> 
The way in which the haloes are worked in a succession of curving rays is evidently characteristic of German embroidery (Johnstone, p. 75), and may be compared with the piece from the Bayerisches Nationalmuseum, Munich illustrated in her book as Fig. 86, and with the Bohemian chasuble bought from Bock by this museum in the following year (1375-1864).

The cope developed from a Roman cloak-like garment and was semi-circular, opening down the front. Orphrey bands ran the full length of the front opening. On the back, the cope retained a vestigial hood which was triangular or shield-shaped. 

Some of the saints depicted on the orphrey bands probably connect this cope to a Cologne church, or at least a church nearby. St Ursula and St Severinus were Cologne saints and St Hubert belonged to a military order established by the Archbishops-Elector of Cologne. Their embroidered names identify them.","Embroidery"
"http://data.silknow.org/object/1ca8b262-7dc7-365e-9a99-a592bf3d784c","http://data.silknow.org/graph/vam","Semi-circular garment made up of widths of deep red silk velvet seamed together; a contrasting embroidered orphrey band is stitched along the opening, and a non-functional embroidered hood is attached centre-back at the neck. The velvet is of the type usually described as <i>ferronerie</i>, because the pomegranate pattern is delineated by a fine outline thought to imitate ironwork. Four full widths of velvet and two three-quarter widths make up the garment, the two central widths are intact, the other panels reveal how carefully this costly textile was used as the outer edges that form the circle have been pieced together from a number of small pieces. A deep fringe is attached round the semi-circular side - probably a later addition although such fringes were used in the Middle Ages. The whole of the cope is lined with deep blue linen (in excellent condition) - also pieced together.

<i>The orphrey bands</i> are embroidered with images of saints (see below), in coloured silks (blue, green, red and brown) and gold thread (Cologne work); there is evidence that originally sequins were sewn on to the blue background embroidery: a few sequins have survived on images of St Lucy and St Severinus, and the reddish thread that attached them to these and other parts of the embroidery is visible against the blue in all cases. The faces of the saints are stitched in white, but the features seem to have been drawn on below the surface (possibly a similar technique to that used as in Butler Bowdon cope). There is also evidence of restoration work executed in white thread, couched down, especially on the right hand side (when worn). A fine yellow braid/ribbon is sewn over the edges of the ophreys on both sides. It dates to either the late 19th or early 20th century.

<i>The hood</i> is of couched gold thread, with figures representing the Death of the Virgin Mary and is very worn. The draperies were originally of gold threads, whipped round with fine coloured silks; the heads of the various figures are of canvas embroidered with fine silks in long and short stitches. A narrow red and white fringe is sewn around the hood. It is lined with blue linen, a shade lighter than the lining of the rest of the cope.

<i>Iconography</i>.  The figures depicted on the orphreys are saints who each inhabit a similar space, placed below a castellated wall, under a decorative Gothic arch, they stand on a tesselated floor; below the floor, in Latin, is the inscription bearing the appropriate name. When the cope was on the clergyman's body, the saints faced each other across the opening: from bottom to top, St John the Baptist faced St Hubert, St Ursula faced St Lucy, St Severinus faced St Bernadino and Saint Elizabeth faced St Mary Magdalene. The textiles worn by the saints (as long flowing robes) echo the pattern found on the velvet of the cope - large, abstract pomegranate designs. Each saint carries the appropriate indicator of status and attribute: the bishops Severinus and Hubert wear mitres and carry croziers, those of royal lineage, Ursula and Elizabeth (of Hungary) wear crowns, the martyrs, Ursula and Lucy carry palm fronds. Mary Magdalen is depicted with long flowing tresses, holding a vase of ointment; Elizabeth holding a garment (no doubt an allusion to those she made for those in need). 

The hood shows the death of the Virgin. She lies in a rectilinear bed in a room with a window on the left hand side above the bed. Round the bed are twelve male figures with haloes round their heads. Eleven are bald and bearded, the twelfth is clean-shaven and has a full head of hair. He is holding a jar (?). He and two other saints in the group are behind the bed, looking towards the Virgin; one of them holds a palm branch. To their right is another group whose attention is focussed on an object that looks like an incense burner. In front of the bed side two saints looking at a book, and to their right is another saint with a book who looks as if he is reading to the assembled crowd.  Only the faces, hands and hair of the saints is executed in silk (much worn); the rest of the embroidery (draperies, bed, background) is in different metal threads (the Virgin's robes, sheet and pillow, probably in silver-gilt; the saints'/apostles' garments, bed, bedcover, background) in gold. The metal threads are couched down, the background using a red silk, and creating a geometric diaper pattern. The ground is badly worn, so much of the brownish linen base textile is visible. The haloes are worked in a succession of curving rays, which shows up the gold to great advantage. A shield has been applied centre bottom of the hood; it is divided in half, the left blue with two silver cylinders, the right red with a gold band at the top and two gold chevrons over the red. Round the edge of the hood is a half-inch band of brick stitch embroidery in metal thread, and attached round the outer edge of that band is a narrow braid in red and white (half-inch), ending in a fringe.","Embroidery"

The embroidery has been built up from a base of linen, stitched in coloured silk (in three shades of green, of blue and of red), silver, and silver-gilt thread, in couching, and long and short stitch. The ground of the embroidery is executed in different textures and fillings of metallic thread, and some of it is raised work. The pattern on the velvet consists of an interrupted wavy diagonal stem, bearing on one side conventionalised pine-cones, and on the other pomegranates in a circle of leaves. This pattern is seen best on the back of the chasuble as the front has been pieced together. The back is also much less worn than the front, revealing the construction of the embroidery. It is lined in blue linen.

<i>Iconography</i> 
The orphreys depict scenes from the Life of the Virgin, mainly on backgrounds of gold and silver and were originally intended for a cope rather than a chasuble. They have been mutilated when recycled, the lowest compartment of the design cut to suit the length of the chasuble, and two of the remaining compartments used to trim the neckline. They have been unsympathetically used, so that the same scene is at the same level, but cannot be read left to right. Each scene comprises a group of people in an architectural setting, definitely classical in line rather than Gothic.The folds on the clothing of the figures are very carefully delineated.

Round the neck: 
(1) the death of the Virgin, lying on a bed surrounded by the Apostles, and 
(2) the Assumption of the Virgin, borne up by angels with St Thomas by the tomb below.

On the back: 
(1) the Anunciation; the Virgin seated, the Angel kneeling, God the Father appearing in the clouds and the Dove descending; 
(2) the presentation of the Virgin in the Temple; she ascends the stair to the High Priest, her parents, St Anna and St Joachim, wait below; 
(3) the meeting of St Anna and St Joachim; they embrace before the Golden Gate of Jerusalem, an angel touches their heads and a manservant and maidservant attend them; 
(4) the rejection of St Joachim's offering: he carries away a lamb from the altar behind which three priests are sitting or standing; 
(5) the angel appearing to St Joachim among the shepherds, the lower part is missing. 

On the front orphrey: 
(1) the Announcement of the approaching death of the Virgin, she is seated, the angel bearing the palm kneels to her, behind her stand a group of the Apostles; 
(2) the betrothal of the Virgin to St Joseph; the priest joins their hands in the presence of St Anna and three suitors; the two figures on the extreme outer edges are very fashionable dressed for the mid 15th century
(3) the birth of the Virgin; St Anna in bed, a woman beside her and a servant bringing a bowl, the lower part cut away.","Embroidery"

Prior to the 1960s, the priest stood facing the altar with his back to the congregation, so the back of the chasuble was visible most of the time. The front is more worn than the back because it has rubbed against the altar. The embroidery on the orphrey bands tells the story of the Life of the Virgin Mary, mother of Jesus Christ, from the moment the angel announced her forthcoming birth to her mother St Anne, until her journey to heaven after her death.

The silk velvet of the chasuble was probably made in Italy, which boasted the most sophisticated centres of silk manufacturing in Europe in the 15th century. The style of the embroidery on the orphreys is very similar to Florentine paintings of the early to mid-15th century. The shape dates to the 17th century or later. Precious silk and fine embroidery, especially containing metallic threads, were used economically and were often recycled.","Embroidery"

The chasuble is an example of the richly decorated vestments commissioned for use in the Church. This particular example is typical of the International Gothic style favoured in the fifteenth centuries, the silk velvet characterised by scrolling motifs consistent with a dating of the late fifteenth century. Such a silk was suitable for both secular and ecclesiastical use, and might have been made in an Italian or Spanish centre (the most developed in Europe at this time). At that period chasubles were conical in shape, rather than fiddle- or violin-shaped, so this garment must have been altered at a later date (after the beginning of the seventeenth century). The silk may even have begun its life as a different form of dress or furnishing altogether, no major distinction between secular and ecclesiastical designs being made at that time. The orphreys may well date to earlier in the century, their composition and treatment being similar to Italian paintings of the 1420-50 period. The dimensions of the compartments of the orphreys may be useful eventually in identifying the geographical location of making (when guild regulations become easily accessible for different cities). Currently, identification can only be speculative, based on the aesthetics of the images. It is possible that these orphrey bands were originally intended/used for a cope. The embroidery was probably executed either in a professional workshop (urban or church) or by nuns. Certain similarities with the needlework image of St Verdiana (Viridiana) (4216-1857) in terms of composition and architectural setting are very evident; it is thought to be Florentine.

<i>Iconography of orphreys</i> 
The Life of the Virgin is told in the embroidered panels on the orphreys in eight vignettes, including the Annunciation and Assumption. Rogers and Tinagli note that from as early as the 2nd century, Mary's virtues of humility, obedience, modesty and silence were extolled in contrast to Eve's negative characteristics, and that in the early fifteenth century such ideas were communicated to a wider audience visually via Fra Angelico's Annunciation scenes, and verbally by preachers such as the Franciscan Bernardino da Siena (e.g. in a 1427 sermon). Devotional activities focussed on different aspects of her life and were encouraged in Italy by both the church and the state, and many groups - not just women - felt drawn to her cult.  Rosika Parker suggests that 'heroic women who transcended in virtue all women and all humans' became a popular theme in Renaissance writing, and that they were increasingly portrayed as meek and domesticated figures. At this time, celebrations of the Assumption of the Virgin were increasingly embroidered on ecclesiastical vestments , complementing her image as Mary the mother. In this representation, the architectural sets and the scenes with her parents undoubtedly stress her humanity as well as the importance of her role as the mother of Jesus Christ.

Caskets were made and used by girls in the 17th century. The girls would decorate small panels with embroidery which would then be sent to a cabinet-maker to be made up into a casket. They were often fitted with compartments for sewing and writing as well as a small mirror. Many cabinets also had secret compartments, used to store personal possessions such as jewellery or letters. The high cost of the materials, as well as the skill needed to create these caskets, means they could only have been made in wealthy households.

<b>People</b>
The panels were worked by young girls, aged around 11 or 12, as part of their education. Girls started learning needlework skills aged 6 or 7, first creating a band sampler (see T.433-1990) and then moving on to more complex pieces such as cutwork. Embroidering the panels of a casket or for a mirror (see T.17-1955) appears to have been one of the last stages of a girl’s needlework education. These skills would be useful later in life in the management of a household.

<b>Materials & Designs</b>
Biblical, mythological and classical scenes were all popular themes for decorating caskets. While some girls may have designs their own panels, taking inspiration from sources such as illustrated bibles, it also appears to have been possible to have purchased designs, which the embroiderer could then customise by using certain colours or adding in features. Most of the caskets in the V&amp;A collection are decorated with many different stitches to showcase the skill of the embroiderer, unusually this casket is decorated almost entirely in tent stitch.","Embroidery"

As the fashion for wearing boots when out and about grew, it became practical to adopt a new type of comfortable shoe for use exclusively in the home.  Some women purchased patterns and embroidered slippers for themselves or their husbands.  

Here silk braids have been stitched to the black woollen 'upper' in the shape of flowers, leaves and scrolls.  The process of attaching one material to another in this way is called appliqué.  The pale blue silk edging and lining were probably chosen to correspond with the pale blue of some of the flowers.  The wear to the lining and insole of the slippers indicates that they were well used before entering the museum's collections in the early twentieth century.","Embroidery"

Plain sewing - hemming and seaming - was of particular value for the production of underclothes and basic household linens.  Only a privileged few, however, were able to afford the time and materials for embroidery.  There appear to have been a number of accepted markers in the development of a competent needlewoman.  First a band sampler was completed, illustrating the range of stitches and techniques that the girl had mastered.  Then these skills were developed by sewing a more complex and demanding cut-work sampler.  In many cases the final challenge was the production of a casket like this one, depicting scenes from myth or the Bible using a wide range of stitches and materials.  In particular these caskets employ raised work, the technique of embroidering over padding.

It is probable that each individual figure or element was sewn independently and then applied to the delicate white satin background.  This meant that the needlewoman could experiment and correct mistakes which would be impossible to rework on the satin.  Once the panels were completed they were sent to a local cabinet-maker who mounted them on wood and made them up into a casket.  The silver braid conceals the joins and prevents the satin from fraying. 

Different scenes, almost certainly derived from contemporary prints, adorn each of the five visible surfaces of the casket.","Embroidery"

This richly embroidered waistcoat is an example of lavish European court dress. The bright yellow colour was fashionable for both men and women. The generous length and the pocket flaps allowed for rich decoration. The design includes Rococo motifs such as a sinuous pattern of scrolling leaves, but the bold treatment and large scale of the vegetation are more characteristic of the earlier Baroque style.

The length of the waistcoat and the sumptuous embroidery and are both characteristic of the period and the rich yellow of the dyed satin was fashionable in men’s and women’s dress from the 1730s until the 1780s.

The decorative pattern incorporates large stylised exotic flowers and leaves with feathered scrolls, arranged in broad borders down each front, over the pocket flaps and the front of the waistcoat skirts.

The scale of the embroidery pattern, its range of textures and use of metallic threads are reminiscent of the Baroque style, commanding splendid effects in rich materials. However, the design demonstrates characteristic Rococo elements of scrolls, naturalistic ornament and extravagant forms; with the regular sinuous pattern of ornate scroll shaped leaves and diapered infilling introducing the lighter grace of the Rococo style.

This waistcoat is unusually opulent as the expensive satin has been used not only for the front of the garment but also for the back and the three-quarter length sleeves, neither of which would have been visible when worn with a coat.","Embroidery"

John Heathcote's bobbinet machine, patented in 1809, enabled fine net to be easily produced in wide widths for dresses, which could be hand-embroidered to achieve individual and attractive effects. Net dresses were worn with underdresses of plain silk, sometimes white, or in a matching colour.

Chenille (French for caterpillar) is a type of thick thread made by a weaving process. Cotton or silk is woven into a length of cloth which is then cut into very narrow strips, the severed weft threads creating the tufts which give the yarn its velvety texture. The dense colour of chenille thread creates a contrasting effect with the ground fabric.

Fashion leaders such as Empress Josephine, Napoleon's first wife, helped to popularise dresses of machine net, or 'tulle', which was also produced in France. She owned many machine-made net dresses embroidered with silver or gold metal thread and spangles for formal court occasions.","Embroidery"

Napoleon’s imperial court revived the etiquette of dress from before the Revolution. High-waisted gowns continued in vogue, using a variety of fabrics suited to the formality of different occasions. White muslin was worn in informal dress and lustrous silk for formal events. Machine-made net, or tulle, proved an ideal ground for hand-embroidery in contrasting silk, metal thread and spangles, or, as here, in tufted chenille thread. Tulle was a new product manufactured in England and France.
