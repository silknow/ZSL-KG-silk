http://data.silknow.org/object/6c9992a1-898c-381b-87b8-30bc5a32d236,met,"British wool embroidery, known as crewel embroidery, was a nearly ubiquitous method of decorating furnishing textiles from the 16th through the 18th centuries. Wool could easily be dyed with the natural dyes of the period in a wide array of vivid colors. In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, one of the most popular forms was variations on the Tree of Life motif, inspired by the colorful painted cotton palampores of the same design that were imported into Britain. This pair of bed curtain panels is exceptional for its unusual design, which is more closely related to woven silk textiles of the period. On this grand scale, the leaves also hark back to late medieval decorative cabbage-leaf verdure tapestries. The blue and white palette of the embroidery certainly reflects the immense popularity of the Chinese export and Dutch Delft ceramics that were avidly collected in Britain.These curtain panels would have formed part of a set of hangings, which would have also upper and lower valances, a head cloth, a bed cover or counterpane and wider curtains that would enclose the entire bed when drawn. As the hanging curtains often saw the least amount of physical wear, these are often the elements that survive from a matched set. In addition, the remainder of the textile furnishing in such a bedroom would have coordinated with the bed hangings: seat furniture covers, window curtains and possibly wall hangings.",Embroidery

Based on the small number of documented seventeenth-century embroiderers who made multiple samplers, it is thought that samplers containing whitework, cutwork, drawnwork, and lace designs were stitched only after multi-colored band samplers were finished, as whitework techniques are more difficult. While many surviving English samplers include lace, cutwork, and drawnwork, few examples of seventeenth-century lace have been attributed to English manufacture.This sampler is worked in whitework and reticella, which requires a stitcher to remove warp and weft threads from a piece of fabric before stabilizing the fabric with buttonhole stitches and creating designs based on the grid of the linen. The top of the sampler, worked in satin, eye, and line stitches, features the initials ""MD"" (presumably the initials of the maker) and an alphabet, along with geometric and stylized floral patterns of varying length.

Utilizing variations on a relatively small number of decorative motifs, most notably the pomegranate, palmette, artichoke, and garland, these silken-pile textiles developed from earlier fifteenth-century subtle voided patterns, formed by the appearance of the ground fabric where there was no pile on the surface, into visually and technically more complex designs. Here, the symmetrical pattern of elaborate artichoke forms within lobed compartments surrounded by ogivally arranged intertwined leaves and flowers is woven with metal thread, and some details are executed with metal loops (bouclé) for additional texture. The jewel-tone silk velvet primarily forms the background, which, in areas, has a subtle ""sculpted"" leaf pattern achieved by juxtaposing two different heights of the velvet pile.Woven in Italy—particularly Florence, Venice, and Genoa—and in Spain, velvets were coveted throughout Europe and also in Turkey, where production demonstrated reciprocal influences, especially with Venetian weavings. This particular example exhibits Eastern influence in the crenate collar or clip motif that secures the garlands. Contemporary paintings, inventories, and extant examples clearly indicate the international appeal of velvets and their varied uses: from ecclesiastical vestments to caftans and European-style garments for the very wealthy, to opulent furnishings, cloths of honor, and diplomatic gifts.",Velvet

Close inspection reveals the high quality and intriguingly delicate structure of the paint and the fragility of the panels, which is not evident at  first glance. That the chair and settee have survived in such good condition is testimony to the technical skills of the maker, who provided a sound base for the heavy glass strips, preventing them from peeling away over time. Nevertheless, these are display pieces that were clearly not intended for regular use. The smallest body movement of a user or any attempt to shift or lift the heavy objects puts divergent forces and pressure on their ostentatious ""skin.""The Museum's chair and settee are part of a large suite that originally consisted of at least four settees and twenty side chairs.[1] Early in the twentieth century the set was in the collection of the earl of Derby, at Derby House, London, from where it was sold in 1940 to Mrs. Violet van der Elst, also of London. The pieces were dispersed in 1948.[2] At that time, all items of the suite were covered with the bold red and gold baroque-cut velvet that still decorates the Museum's pieces. For many years it was assumed that the initials ""PPL"" displayed in a medallion on the backs referred to the Villa Palagonia in Bagheria, near Palermo, and, more specifically, to a member of the illustrious Gravina family as a patron;[3] however, as James David Draper pointed out, although ""the peculiarly Sicilian penchant for fashioning an overall look out of glass was most memorably given free rein at the Villa Palagonia, . . . the initials 'PPL' . . . do not correspond with those of any prince of Palagonia and in truth the pieces have a much more pronounced neo-classical severity than the Villa Palagonia ballroom.""[4]John Richardson, the donor of the Museum's pieces, which he had acquired on the London art market, kept them at one point in the Château de Castille in Provence, the home of the Cubist scholar Douglas Cooper,[5] who himself owned at least three chairs from the set.[6] For the moment, the original location of the suite remains a mystery, although the preciousness and labor-intensive nature of the work narrows the source of the commission to one of the great, prosperous, aristocratic families of Sicily.The back of the settee is tripartite; the medallion with initials appears at the top of the center section, but in the same place on the side sections there is a military trophy in the form of a helmet superimposed on a saber. There is a gilded openwork frieze of overlapping ellipses along the top of the back of both the chair and the settee; this appears also along the bottom of the back of the settee but not on the Museum's chair. These ellipses, rather freely adapted from ancient vase paintings, reflect the so-called Etruscan fashion of the last third of the eighteenth century.[7] A very similar pair of chairs, each, however, with an octagonal verre églomisé panel set into the back in place of upholstery, is part of the collection of Juan March Ordinas at Palau March in Palma de Mallorca.[8] That those panels show a mythological chariot in the manner of an ancient vase painting is also very much in the ""Etruscan"" style. The incorporation of glass panels in the center of the backs makes the March chairs even more fragile than the Derby House suite.[9]Other pieces from this suite are preserved in the Art Institute of Chicago (two chairs),[10] the Ringling Museum of Art, Sarasota, Florida (two settees and two chairs),[11] and the Museum für Kunsthandwerk, Frankfurt am Main (one chair),[12] as well as in various private collections. Some of them have been recovered in shell pink or blue gray fabric with the intention of intensifying the effect of the same shades painted on the glass.[Wolfram Koeppe 2006]Footnotes:[1] Catalogue of a sale at Christie, Manson, and Woods, London, 26 July 1940, lot 41 (sold to Mrs. Violet van der Elst).[2] Catalogue of the Violet van der Elst collection sale, Christie, Manson, and Woods, London, 8 April 1948, lot 114 (ill.).[3] Allen Wardwell.

The Queen of France sat in the balcony in front of the Thuilleries, appeared serious, and our party remarked, that she looked like a very handsome English woman. As soon as the aëronauts had taken their flight, I quitted the gardens.""[1] In his diary entry for December 1, 1783, Joseph Cradock (1742–1826) refers to the many spectators who watched a historic event take place that day: the first manned hydrogen balloon flight. The aeronauts Jacques-Alexandre-César Charles (1746–1823), a physicist, and his collaborator, Marie-Noël Robert (1760–1820), took off from the gardens of the Tuileries in a gondola suspended from a netted hydrogen balloon.Balloon-shaped and carved with netting, the finials of these side chairs, supplied for the queen’s boudoir at the Château des Tuileries in February 1784, celebrate Charles and Robert’s successful flight. Georges Jacob, one of the outstanding menuisiers of the ancien régime, provided the walnut frames, which he described as “of a new shape,” possibly referring to the arched top rail or the seat shaped like a horseshoe. The brothers Rousseau, who were decorative painters as well as sculptors, executed the delicate carving, each element of which is carefully detailed in their 1784 invoice. The chairs’ legs have the form of arrow-filled quivers, and the uprights of the back are shaped like fasces, or bundles of rods tied with ribbon, which symbolized power or authority in classical antiquity. The now little-known Presle, who advertised as “painter and gilder to the king,” gilded the frames. For certain details of the carving, such as the myrtle branches on the seat rails, a clear greenish tone of gilding was chosen to subtly contrast with the yellow gold used elsewhere.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, 2010][1] Cradock 1828, vol. 2, pp. 38–39.",Damask

As such, the animal seen here likely represents the Buddhist six-tusked elephant described in a fifth-century Chinese translation of a sutra as being resplendent and white and having lotuses, jade maidens, and other symbolic figures at the end of each tusk.²Elephants have a long history in China. Given as tribute to the emperor by local rulers, particularly from neighboring Southeast Asian regions where they were raised, elephants were also presented as diplomatic gifts to important foreign kings. Apart from their use as work animals and army transport, they were sometimes tamed to provide entertainment in times of leisure, beloved by the royal courts. In sixteenth-century Europe, elephants held a similar fascination for royals and commoners alike, and they appear in the works of such artists as Durer and Raphael. Shipped by boat from Ceylon to Lisbon, elephants were offered as gifts of the Portuguese kings to the courts of Spain, Austria, France, and England. In 1514, Manuel I of Portugal gave a white elephant (the famous ""Hanno"" known through Raphael's drawings) to Pope Leo X.  An  elephant given by the court of Lisbon to Philip II of Spain in 1581 was subsequently passed along to Henry IV of France.  A year later Henry, in turn, gve it to Queen Elizabeth of England, a brillia;nt ""re-gifting"" of an asset deemed too expensive to maintain.³ Here the combination of Buddhist symbols and Habsburg eagles produces a composite message of a religious and political nature that juxtaposes the two cultures of Asia and Europe.  We do not know how long this long-preserved length of fabric was originally used, but its delicate quality indicates that it may have been part of a garment or hanging.⁴Woven in China and likely exported through the port of Macau, this textile's blend of Asian and European taste and style was intended for a foreign market that may not have understood the Buddhist elements but nonetheless would have appreciated the fine weaving and exotic designs.[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013]1. The textile is composed of a five-harness satin damask, with a blue warp and yellow weft. The blue color is presumably indigo, while the yellow dye was made from the Asian pagoda tree (Sophora japonica). Dye analysis was conducted by Nobuko Shibayama in the Department of Scientific Research, Metropolitan Museum, with High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Photo Diode Array (HPLC-PDA). 2. “The creature is colossal . . . and is whiter than the snows of the Himalayas. At the ends of his six tusks are six bathing tanks, in each of which grow fourteen lotuses. On each open blossom is a ‘jade maiden’ fairer than the damsels of Paradise, in whose hands are five spontaneously created lutes; each lute is accompanied by 500 other musical instruments, and 500 jewel-colored birds.” Guan Puxian pu sa xing fa jing (Sutra on the Practice of Visualizing the Bodhisattva Samantabhadra), in Soper, “Literary Evidence for Early Buddhist Art in China,” p. 223. 3.

A fragment of the white selvage with a blue stripe is preserved along the seam in two areas (visible at the back). Digby, “Some Silks Woven under Portuguese Influence in the Far East,” pp. 55 ? 56 and n. 11, notes that several Asian damasks from Macau have a white twill selvage with a stripe and that the structure of this selvage is distinct from other silks thought to be from Macau; the elephant silk conforms to the technical features of that group.

The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds. Various birds, insects, and wind instruments are rendered around this medallion, while a sunburst is shown above and Juno with peacock below. The closeness of the depiction of Louis XIV to an image of the king painted on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles by Charles Le Brun in 1683 – 84 makes it likely that the designs for the main figures in the set of hangings were supplied by his workshop; however, they may be the work of the painter François Bonnemer (1638 – 1689 ), who is known to have made cartoons after compositions by Le Brun. In 1685 Bonnemer provided designs for the embroidered seat covers of the benches and stools in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alentours, or decorative borders, full of delightful details, are believed to be by Jean Lemoyen le Lorrain, an artist little known today who worked in the circle of Le Brun.The other embroideries are thought to depict three of Montespan’s children with the king: Louise-Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes (1673 – 1743 ), with flowers symbolizing Flora, or spring (MMA 46.43.1); Françoise-Marie, Mademoiselle de Blois (1677 – 1749 ), with wheat ears, as Ceres, or summer (MMA 46.43.2); and Louis-Auguste, duc de Maine (1670 – 1736 ), in armor, as Mars, or fire (MMA 46.43.3).The compositions of the seasons include floral wreaths with the zodiac symbols for the appropriate months, while salamanders, torches, smoking braziers, and censers pertain to the element fire. The background of these rare surviving embroideries is worked in metal thread, now tarnished, which must have given them a sumptuous and shimmering appearance when they were first made. The hangings were documented in 1718 as in the collection of Louis-Alexandre, comte de Toulouse (1678 – 1737 ), the youngest child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, at the Château de Rambouillet. During the nineteenth century they belonged to King Louis-Philippe and were hung at the Palais Royal, Paris.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, adapted from The Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts/Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide and Jeffrey Munger; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010]",Embroidery

http://data.silknow.org/object/272bdbaf-8618-3d21-bb29-2681aca14f89,met,"Until recently, products of the Dutch silk-weaving industry have been difficult to identify. The duc de Richelieu (Louis-Francois- Armand de Vignerod du Plessis, 1696 ・ 1788) collected hundreds of European textile samples between 1720 and 1736 in an attempt to document local and regional production; included in this collection are several woven silks from the Netherlands labeled “Indiennes.” This nomenclature and certain characteristics of the group have been confirmed by recent archival research in Amsterdam.¹  These fabrics have a width of about 30 1⁄2 inches (78 centimeters) and feature distinctively playful patterns with exotic elements, mostly interpretations of Chinese motifs.²  Dutch silk indiennes were certainly intended for fashionable womens dress, as is evident from a particularly spectacular example of Dutch silk weaving at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (no. 43.1871a-c). The Dutch were exporting silk textiles to England, France, and Portugal (and probably indirectly to North America through the British trade) by at least the early eighteenth century. In 1707 an Amsterdam silk manufacturer was called upon to testify to the origin of several Dutch silks after such goods were stopped by English customs on their way into London because they were thought to be from India.³ Both England and France banned the import of Asian silks around the turn of the eighteenth century as protectionist measures in favor of their own silk-weaving industries.⁴Whether the Dutch silk indiennes of the 1720s to 1750s were still confused with Asian silks is not certain; to the modern eye, they are clearly examples of European chinoiserie.  This particular pattern shows a compact walled garden with tiny pagodas flanked by oversize Chinese-style vases holding large flowers. In his 1769 memoirs Jacques-Charles Dutillieu (1718 ・ 1782), a French silk designer and manufacturer, dismissed the quality of Dutch silk designs, saying they were either bad copies of French patterns or designs taken from textiles from the “Indes Orientales” appropriated with a rather unrefined taste.⁵ While his comments are clearly untrue of this charming design, they confirm the competitive nature of the silk industries within western Europe. Although the use of fashionable textiles for ecclesiastical vestments certainly predates the eighteenth century, based on surviving vestments this practice appears to have accelerated after 1700. Eighteenth-century vestments made of dress silks are often attributed to France; the use here of the older Italian woven silk as the hood of this cope is an unusual variation on the practice.

French eighteenth-century beds tended to be lofty, as it was customary to pile them with three or more mattresses filled with straw, wool, horsehair, or feathers. Tobias Smollett (1721–1771) noted in 1766, “French beds are so high, that sometimes one is obliged to mount them by the help of steps.”[1]The custom of receiving visitors while reposing in a large and elegantly fitted out bed was practiced in France during the eighteenth century mostly by aristocratic women. The Museum’s imposing piece of furniture with its exquisitely carved floral decoration, the work of an unknown carver, must have formed a splendid backdrop for such official calls or congratulatory visits. In 1791 the bed is documented as standing in the large bedchamber of Guyonne-Marguerite de Durfort de Lorge, duchesse de Choiseul-Praslin (1737–1806), at her Parisian home, the Hôtel de Belle Isle. Following the turmoil of the Revolution and the political changes of the early nineteenth century, the bed was sold in Paris in 1830. It became part of the famous collections at Hamilton Palace, South Lanarkshire, Scotland, the residence of Alexander Hamilton Douglas, tenth Duke of Hamilton (1767–1852), where it was placed in one of the state rooms. The duke’s grandson sold the contents of the palace, including the bed, at a highly anticipated auction that took place in 1882. Through the intermediation of several dealers, the bed was acquired in 1897 by the financier and railroad executive George J. Gould (1864–1923). His wife, the former actress Edith M.

The view from the house is delightful.— Harry Peckham, A Tour through Holland . . .and Part of FranceLouis XVI purchased the country residence of the duc d’Orléans a few miles west of Paris for Marie-Antoinette in 1785. Being in need of renovation, the palace was enlarged and altered for the queen, and many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené. A member of an important dynasty of Parisian chairmakers, Sené had been appointed menuisier to the Crown in 1784.A detailed 1788 description of this set, which also included four matching armchairs and a stool, indicates that the pieces were intended for one of Marie-Antoinette’s private rooms at Saint-Cloud, her Cabinet Particulier. The frame of the daybed, originally longer but shortened at a later date, is embellished with carving of ivy on the seat rail and garlands of roses along the crest rail. Ionic capitals surmount the short legs, and most remarkable of all are the Egyptian female half-figures on tapering supports that decorate the front stiles. Even though in his bill Sené called them simply caryatids, these figures clearly express the queen’s taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art, well before Napoléon’s North African campaign made it fashionable. Similar ornament is found on the bergère (a comfortable armchair upholstered between the arms and the seat ), which, in addition, has a medallion on top with Marie-Antoinette’s initials framed by myrtle branches and roses. The matching screen, however, displays classical female figures on its feet and top rail. Unfortunately, the identity of the sculptor is not known, but Louis-François Chatard is documented as having painted and gilded the wooden surfaces.The 1789 inventory of Saint-Cloud records the entire suite in the queen’s Cabinet de Toilette, or dressing room. Listed by its show covers, as was customary for seat furniture, the set is described as being upholstered in white cotton twill, embroidered with a small floral ornament in silk. Known to have worked on needlepoint projects all her life, Marie-Antoinette did the embroidery herself, which she executed in satin stitch. Modern replicas of the queen’s handiwork, including her interlaced monogram on the panel of the fire screen, grace the frames of the furniture today.

In addition to this miniature, other examples include: two in the Victoria and Albert Museum, one in the Wallace Collection in London, one in Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen, and one in the collection of John H. Bryan, which is housed in a silver-gilt frame engraved with the royal armorial and date of Charles’s execution, 30 January 1648 (old calendar). Like a painting in silk thread, this miniature represents the merging of two English artistic traditions—a naturalistic rendering of faces using fine techniques such as split stitch, which had been in use in England since the twelfth century, and the painted miniature portrait, a courtly fashion that began during the reign of Henry VIII.The king’s likeness has been taken with great fidelity from a 1641 etching by Wenceslaus Hollar, which was itself ultimately derived from a chain of different prints based on a painted portrait by Anthony van Dyck of Charles I and his consort, Henrietta Maria, painted in 1632. Oliver Millar has noted that van Dyck’s painting is in itself a reworking of the original composition by Daniel Mytens of ca. 1630-32, in the Royal Collection, Hampton Court Palace.The embroidery is contained within a glazed silver frame with molded edges and a suspension loop at the top, flanked on either side by a spiral ribbon cresting. The glass has beveled edges, and its various imperfections and minute air bubbles suggest that it is original to the period. An example of what Daphne Foskett calls a ""cabinet miniature,"" it was intended to be mounted in a cabinet or placed on a table.The bust of Charles is slightly raised from the flat gray-green satin background, an effect produced by the portrait’s having been stitched on satin. The king’s characteristic hairstyle, pointed beard, and upturned moustache are convincingly shaded in various tones of brown, brown-red, and light blond threads. Strands of hair are worked directly on the satin, with the raised portion skillfully merged into the background. The cheeks and jawline are also enhanced by shadowy tones that suggest both stubble and facial bone structure. Each thread is worked in a virtuoso technique that varies the stitch length, tension, and twist in such a way as to manipulate the play of light over the silk fibers. The intensity of detail can be grasped in a number of passages, such as Charles’s right eye, which is created from an amalgam of minute stitches. One can see under magnification that the lower lid is outlined by a minute pink thread, couched down, and worked over by a mass of flesh-toned silk. The iris is laid down in several shades of blue thread, separated from the black pupil by a lighter couching thread, which not only suggests depth by pulling the other threads around the pupil, but also creates the catch-light that defines Charles’s expression.The extraordinarily developed detail of this and the other, similar miniature portraits of the king led at one time to their being dated to the later eighteenth century, when interest in the cult of the martyred king was still strong. J.L. Nevinson, however, demonstrated the use of such techniques in other works that can be firmly placed in the period between 1650 and the end of the seventeenth century, including an embroidered bookbinding with a detailed portrait of a youth now in the Houghton Library at Harvard University that contains a copy of Hopkins’s Psalms dated 1648. It is likely then that the miniature was produced in the second half of the seventeenth century, either before or, as Nevinson posited, in the years immediately following the Restoration and is thus part of the imagery associated with the cult of the Royal Martyr.The link with the cult of Charles the Martyr is made explicit by the embroidered inscription, a quotation from Psalm 18, which associates Charles directly with the Old Testament patriarch King David: ""Deus meus est Rvpis mea Psa: 18."" The reference is to Psalm 18:2–3, which invokes God’s protection against his enemies: ""The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the lord, who is worthy to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies."" Although the connection between contemporary monarchs and King David was a commonplace one, the specific association made here, of Charles I with the Psalms of King David, assumed a central importance in his posthumous cult. It drew from that most popular of all commemorative works, the literary ""self-portrait"" of the martyred king, the Eikon Basilike, a book notionally containing Charles Stuart’s own apologia for his life and reign, which, with its inclusion of the king’s favorite prayers and psalms, offered a kind of spiritual autobiography. Both the prayers and the meditations of the Eikon Basilike explicitly echo the Psalms of David. Indeed, the embroidered image is taken directly from a print that serves as the frontispiece of the Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae of 1651, an expanded edition of the king’s works with a bound-in 1649 version of the Eikon Basilike. As Elizabeth Wheeler has shown, the ""repeated evocation of the Psalms, the emphasis on conscience, the insistence on the depth and sorrow of his sufferings"" found in this work all presented a figure intimately accessible to ordinary laymen and women.This intimacy was reflected in small-scale portraits like the present example and other small commemorative objects that were made in the years immediately after the king’s execution. They reflect, too, the peculiarly private aspect of mourning for the king that characterized the ten-year period before the Restoration, during which time there were few permitted outlets for public grief. As Lois Potter has suggested, this circumstance conditioned the nature of the ensuing cult of the martyred king and in particular stimulated the production of such small, intimate kinds of memorial art. The inclusion of the scriptural inscription explicitly offered up the image of the martyred king as a spiritual model. The tradition that the monarch’s own hair was worked into the image would have further emphasized the character of a relic. A number of such objects are recorded in the former collection of Percival D. Griffiths. A poem by Jeremiah Wells (1646–1679), written in reaction to an analogous small-scale portrait of Charles drawn in ink on parchment, which he saw in the library of St. John’s College, Oxford, in 1665, vividly conveys the ecstatic emotions such portraits could summon up. In the latter portrait, the identification of Charles with King David is made literally indelible, for the lines of the face and hair are rendered in minute script that supposedly contain the whole Book of Psalms, or at least the Penitential Psalms. In a manuscript draft of the poem (later amended), Wells begins: ""Wash thy impure feet, and trembling trace / With wary steps this more than sacred place."" The first stanza of the published version continues in similarly hyperbolic fashion, mystically equating the king’s body with the divine word:""With double reverence we approach to lookOn what’s at once a picture and a book:Nor think it Superstition to adoreA king made now more sacred then before . . .The object here’s Majestick and divine,Divinity does Majesty enshrine . . .""A portrait of the playwright Thomas Killigrew, painted by William Shephard one year after the king’s execution, when Killigrew was in Venice as the political agent of the exiled Charles II, provides visual evidence, similarly rhetorical, as to how such images of the king were used. Killigrew sits at his desk with a (somewhat larger) portrait of Charles I on the wall behind him. He adopts a classic attitude of melancholy, which in other circumstances might have signified merely his own creative temperament, but which in this context may be taken to connote a stoical, philosophical grief for the executed king. His loyalty to the Stuart cause is further underlined by the copy of the Eikon Basilike that lies beneath the pile of his own plays. It is easy to imagine the embroidered portrait miniature eliciting similar kinds of response.[Jonathan Tavares and Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",Embroidery

http://data.silknow.org/object/dc97567e-7ee1-3a61-b3ab-e36ff6cddcf3,met,"The imagery of this panel is unusual in that it juxtaposes King Charles I and his consort, Henrietta Maria, with Adam and Eve beneath the Tree of Knowledge. To some extent, the panel can be classified with other commonly occurring images of the royal couple in contemporary embroidery. These appear to have been primarily celebratory or commemorative in nature, but the direct association made here between contemporary royalty and Adam and Eve is unique among surviving embroidered pictures, indeed among the images of royalty in every medium. It therefore has significance within the wider field of royal iconography of the Caroline era.The embroidery can be dated to a time after 1634, because the poses of Charles I and Henrietta Maria are derived from an engraving by Robert van Voerst first published in that year. The print shows Charles and Henrietta Maria exchanging olive and laurel branches, emblems of peace and military glory, and it celebrates their marriage and the political advantages that accrued from it. The print is a copy of the painting by Anthony van Dyck of 1632, which itself is a reworking of an original by Daniel Mytens of ca. 1630–32.This association between royal marriage and royal authority is carried over into the embroidery, although apart from the poses of the royal couple, it retains little of the symbolism of its prototype. In place of the exchange of olive and laurel branches between the royal couple, Henrietta Maria offers her husband a flower, while Charles holds a sword and scepter, the symbols of worldly dominion. The association of the royal marriage and Charles’s symbols of monarchy with Adam and Eve, the first married couple, carries the suggestion that Charles’s claim to royal authority rests on a chain of royal—specifically familial—descent stretching back to the Fall and even before that, to humankind’s state of innocence. Such a juxtaposition would have resonated in the 1630s and 1640s with the political debates that raged over the nature of political authority. In these debates, the varied justifications for political organization, whether Royalist, Parliamentarian, or Leveller, were invariably based on some understanding of Adamic patriarchy and the first marriage. For all political complexions, the concept of Paradise that had once existed in some place and time provided the key to the way in which ideal social relations once were and should still be.The theme of the panel appears to be an explicit reflection of the Royalist argument, which saw Adamic patriarchy as the basis of the divine right of kings. In The Glasse of Time (1620), Thomas Peyton described James I as ""A royall King deriued from the race, / O f Edens Monarch in her greatest grace, / Within whose face true Maiesty doth shine."" According to Richard Cumberland, a friend of Samuel Pepys, ""Humankind, and by consequence, all Societies and Families sprang from the matrimonial Union of one Man with one Woman. And, consequently, all Civil Government is originally laid out in a natural Parental Authority"" (De Legibus Naturae, 1672). Such arguments and their counter-arguments, which maintained that the right to govern derived from the consent of the people, were furiously debated during the crisis of Parliament and the Civil War years of the 1640s. John Maxwell, chaplain to Charles I, argued in Sacro-Sancta Regum Majestas (1644) that monarchy was fixed by God in the time before the Fall. ""Can we be so stupid as to acknowledge the dominion over all creatures below is given to man immediately by God, and to deny that the most noble and excellent Government by which man hath Power and Empire over men is not from God . . . but by Compact and Contract, the Composition and Constitution of men?"" Sir Robert Filmer, in his Patriarcha: or, The Natural Right of Kings (probably written about 1630, but not published until 1680), justified monarchy on hereditary grounds—that Adam and the patriarchs after him had royal authority over their children by right of fatherhood, and that this authority had been given to them by God. ""The first Father had not only simply power, but power monarchical, as he was a Father immediately from God. For by the appointment of God, as soon as Adam was created he was monarch of the world, though he had no subjects."" For Filmer, Adam’s was ""[a]s large and ample as the Absolutest Dominion of any Monarch which hath been since the Creation.""Such views reached the popular domain via sermons and pamphlets. John Evelyn recorded in a diary entry of May 1678 having heard a sermon that argued for the monarchical over all other systems of government, ""& that from Adam (to whom God had given the Empire of all things & Persons) that it seemed to be not onely of divine, but most natural institution."" And on January 30, 1694, the anniversary of the death of Charles I, Evelyn heard a young man preach on the ""Excellency of Kingly Government above all other, deriving it from Adam, The Patriarchs, God himselfe."" The panel therefore shows an embroiderer directly engaged in these debates, asserting sympathy for the Royalist cause. As such, it shows the expressive freedom of the embroidery medium, which because of its relatively private nature allowed its makers to react personally to events and to create images encompassing themes that lay outside and beyond the iconographical norms of public art, both popular prints and the more exclusive iconography of the court.[Andrew Morrall, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",Embroidery

The panels were woven by Camille Pernon, premier producer of luxury silks in Lyon. The central embroidered landscapes, based on paintings of the countryside surrounding Arunjuez, were probably applied after the panels were delivered to Spain.Dugourc, who was raised at Versailles, was named dessinateur du Garde-Meuble de la Couronne in 1784.

Slomann’s theory that these woven silks were designed, and is some cases produced, in India was quickly refuted, but the term has stuck.¹ The precise origin for this distinctive style of silk produced in Europe between about 1690 and 1720 has not been established; a number of cultures clearly contributed to the creation of these patterns. Certain relationships have been drawn: for example, an integration of Japanese design concepts such as the abstraction of motifs and a discrepancy of scale has been suggested as a primary influence.² In this panel the influence of Ottoman sixteenth- and seventeenth-century design is apparent in the meandering pattern and the layering of motifs, as well as in their large scale. Like many European bizarre silks, the motifs in this panel have become so stylized that they defy identification. The high quality of this particular example and others of the type suggests that these textiles were made in well-established European weaving centers, such as Lyon or Tours in France, in Venice, or in other Italian or Spanish textile-producing cities. A small number of them have been associated with the Spitalfields weaving center (now in the East End of London) on the basis of the extant design drawings by several early eighteenth-century English designers.³ The Dutch are known to have had a significant silk-weaving industry as well (see MMA 1976.12), and some Dutch examples of bizarre silk from the early eighteenth century have been identified.⁴ There are few complete garments surviving from the turn of the eighteenth century, but a rare unaltered bizarre silk mantua is at the Metropolitan Museum (see MMA 1991.6.1a,b). Mantuas of this period were relatively unstructured women’s gowns that took most of their shape from draping and pinning on the body. The expanse of fabric from the shoulder to the train created an ideal showcase for such luxurious textiles with large patterns.Very few bizarre silks seem to have been used for interior decoration, though vegetal motifs similar to those seen on the dress silks found their way to embroidered furnishings (see MMA 53.32.1a-d and 53.32.2a-d). 1.

This series included portraits of Louis XIV, his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, marquise de Montespan (1641 – 1707 ), and six of their children, all shown as deities. The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers. The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds. Various birds, insects, and wind instruments are rendered around this medallion, while a sunburst is shown above and Juno with peacock below. The closeness of the depiction of Louis XIV to an image of the king painted on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles by Charles Le Brun in 1683 – 84 makes it likely that the designs for the main figures in the set of hangings were supplied by his workshop; however, they may be the work of the painter François Bonnemer (1638 – 1689 ), who is known to have made cartoons after compositions by Le Brun. In 1685 Bonnemer provided designs for the embroidered seat covers of the benches and stools in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alentours, or decorative borders, full of delightful details, are believed to be by Jean Lemoyen le Lorrain, an artist little known today who worked in the circle of Le Brun.The other embroideries are thought to depict three of Montespan’s children with the king: Louise-Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes (1673 – 1743 ), with flowers symbolizing Flora, or spring (MMA 46.43.1); Françoise-Marie, Mademoiselle de Blois (1677 – 1749 ), with wheat ears, as Ceres, or summer (MMA 46.43.2); and Louis-Auguste, duc de Maine (1670 – 1736 ), in armor, as Mars, or fire (MMA 46.43.3).The compositions of the seasons include floral wreaths with the zodiac symbols for the appropriate months, while salamanders, torches, smoking braziers, and censers pertain to the element fire. The background of these rare surviving embroideries is worked in metal thread, now tarnished, which must have given them a sumptuous and shimmering appearance when they were first made. The hangings were documented in 1718 as in the collection of Louis-Alexandre, comte de Toulouse (1678 – 1737 ), the youngest child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, at the Château de Rambouillet. During the nineteenth century they belonged to King Louis-Philippe and were hung at the Palais Royal, Paris.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, adapted from The Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts/Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide and Jeffrey Munger; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010]",Embroidery

The sampler is divided roughly into two parts, with the natural world presented at the top and geometric motifs below.Spot samplers may have come closest to fulfilling the etymological destiny of the sampler, or exemplar, as ""an example to be imitated; a model, pattern; an archetype."" They are composed of collections of patterns and stitches to which the maker might refer when she was in need of inspiration or guidance for a particular technique. They generally do not include a date or a name in the body of the work that would allow a connection to be made with an embroiderer at a certain point in her education.A. J. B. Wace cited the existence of samplers as early as the beginning of the sixteenth century, writing that one was purchased for Elizabeth of York, who died in 1503, and that Elizabeth, Countess of Oxford, who died in 1537, left her two sisters twelve samplers in her will, although it is not clear that these were the work of her own hand. The earliest extant English sampler is preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum; it was inscribed and dated by Jane Bostock in 1598. A sampler with a very similar composition to the present example composed of tent-stitch slips and animals above a group of geometric designs worked in silk and metal threads, is also in the Victoria and Albert Museum (inv. no. T.234-1928). Spot samplers were originally dated to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century, but more recently they have been reassigned to the mid-seventeenth century on the basis of a group of dated spot samplers that Carol Humphrey has brought to light. Spot samplers are relatively rare survivals compared to seventeenth century band samplers, which may result from their continuing usefulness as pattern references, a function that would have worn them out. The fact that these are rarely dated or signed may indicate that some are the work of professional teachers or embroiderers, in which case they would not have been treasured and saved by the descendants of the makers in the same way as ""schoolgirl"" accomplishments. Nevertheless, early in their existence they were certainly valued by the women who actually referred to them. The manner in which the maker of this sampler used materials and the fact that several individual motifs in this piece were left half-finished suggest that this is the first draft of a final work. Once the maker had mastered the technique and produced enough of the design to judge the final effect, there was no need to waste precious materials, particularly metal threads, and time in completing the motif.Geometric patterns similar to those found on this sampler were used on small purses and other decorative accessories; a cushion in the Colonial Williamsburg collection (inv. no. 1967-62), for example, is decorated with a similar diamond-shaped motif. It has been suggested that the tent-stitch motifs, or slips, on spot samplers were intended to be cut out and applied to another ground fabric for the production of valances, bed hangings, or cushion covers. It seems more likely that these were intended to be saved as design ideas rather than used in another end product.

It is difficult to date this type of velvet precisely, as it was fashionable for formal interiors over a period of many years. The same type of design-large flowers and scrolling leaves symmetrically arranged to cover the entire width of a textile-also appears in monochrome damasks of the period.Velvet is distinguished from other flat textiles by its pile weave. This texture was created by an extra warp, in addition to the warp necessary for the background of the fabric. The pile warps were passed over small rods to create the loops of the pile. A polychrome velvet required as many extra sets of warps as it had colors in the pile, in this case four colors of velvet pile on a white satin background. Jardinière velvets usually had a combination of cut and uncut loops, giving further texture to the design. In this example, the combination of cut and uncut velvet on a smooth satin surface gives it an especially rich character, as all of the surfaces reflect the light differently.",Velvet

The bag, which would have been used to store embroidery implements and supplies, is decorated on both front and back with red wool thread, primarily in a double running stitch, on a linen foundation.Embroidery was an essential component of female education in England in the seventeenth century; students generally completed at least one sampler displaying a variety of techniques and designs. By the mid-seventeenth century the repeating border designs worked on samplers had become anachronistic in the contemporary design vocabulary, having been derived from sixteenth-century pattern books produced on the Continent and adapted by English publishers. To find an old-fashioned border design on a practical object like this work bag is unusual. Yet the detached motifs in the carefully organized yet lively design - human figures; native plants and flowers, including strawberries, acorns and honeysuckle; heraldic animals such as lions, leopards, and stags; and more prosaic creatures such as birds and caterpillars - are typical of those found on English embroidered textiles throughout this era.",Embroidery

Those who could not afford a cabinet mounted with imported Asian lacquer panels or a suite of tapestries like those produced by John Vanderbank (see MMA 53.165.2) could still satisfy their taste by wearing a petticoat or other fashionable accessory decorated with exotic motifs. In 1688 John Stalker and George Parker published A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing, which includes twenty-four copperplate designs that could be used to decorate a variety of objects (see MMA 32.80.2). This book also gives detailed instructions on how to create imitation lacquer, or japanning, on various household objects. The text shows a lack of specificity regarding culture and geography that was typical of the period. For example, in their preface, the authors sing the praises of Japan and its architecture, but in the instructions the reader is advised ""that if you would exactly imitate and copie [sic] out the Japan [design for imitation lacquer]"" one should look to ""the true Indian work"" where they ""never crowd up their ground with many Figures, Houses, or Trees, but allow great space to little work.""¹There are extant English mirrors that retain their original ""Japanned"" frames, as well as American furniture decorated with motifs from works like A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing.² However, such books inspired more than just imitation lacquer on furniture. This embroidered panel and its mate are among a number of English examples from the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries that are stitched with similar exotic designs. A small quilt in the Metropolitan Museum and two panels in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, are all embroidered with the motifs of the woman carrying a fan with an attendant who shades her with a parasol, and tiny pavilions dwarfed by oversize foliage.³  One of the panels in Boston bears the rare signature of a professional pattern draftsman, one John Stilwell who had a shop near Covent Garden, London. Stilwell would have drawn his designs directly on fabric that was then embroidered; for inspiration he probably relied on publications such as A Treatise of Japanning and Varnishing.

A quintessential account in the Western classical tradition, the story of the Trojan War inspired large sets of European tapestries; the earliest documented set was presented to Charles the Bold in 1472.¹ This embroidered hanging, too, was part of a large set, of which the Metropolitan Museum owns three, and four are preserved in other collections.² All have the same border, including an armorial at each corner that does not correspond completely with any known arms. Perhaps it is an erroneous rendering of the arms of the Mascarenhas family of Portugal; the nobleman Francisco Mascarenhas served as governor of Macau from 1623 to 1626. The abduction of Helen ignited war between Troy and Greece; this version, in which Helen is forcibly seized, relies on postclassical sources.³ Against a backdrop of European-style buildings with Baroque facades and struggling armored figures, a protesting Helen is carried off by two men, away from her white-bearded husband, Menelaus, and toward a boat on the right where the Trojan prince Paris awaits. No single print source has yet been found, but the subject matter and composition of the hanging were surely based on European sources.⁴The Chinese embroiderers were responsible for many details from the Chinese decorative vocabulary, such as the waves in the background, the phoenixes in the center of the upper border, various details of the armor, the scales of the serpents and tritons in the border, and the lychee fruit seen outlined against the side of the boat. While most of the hanging is embroidered, the figures’ faces and exposed limbs were painted directly on the cotton foundation cloth, probably also in China. Especially in the faces, the modeling of light and shadow for a three-dimensional effect, while naively done, shows an aspect of European-style painting that had reached East Asia with Jesuit missionaries in the sixteenth century. The Italian Jesuit Giovanni Niccolo (or Nicolao, 1563–1626) established an academy of painting in Japan in 1583 to train local artists to produce religious art. When the missionaries’ relations with Japanese authorities deteriorated, Niccolo fled Japan, returning to Macau in 1614. Some of his students became active in China, including You Wenhui (baptized Manoel Pereira, 1575–1633), a young Chinese from Macau, and Ni Yicheng (also known as Jacopo Niva, 1579–1635), of Japanese and Chinese parentage. You Wenhui produced the only surviving painted portrait of the Jesuit leader Matteo Ricci (1552–1610).⁵ The more highly regarded Ni Yicheng had studied at Niccolo’s academy in Japan, and in China he ""was in constant demand to paint works . . . both for the mission in China and the Jesuits’ church in Macau.""⁶ Perhaps these artists or less well-documented colleagues were responsible for painting this textile.  Scientific analysis of the hanging’s pigments supports this intercultural possibility: results show a blue-green pigment not used in Asia and a white not used in Europe. Furthermore, the white pigment occurs more frequently in Japanese than in Chinese contexts.⁷[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1.

Most were made of fragile wax, clay, and plastiline (a wax- and oil-based modeling material). Many had deteriorated. Only a few were preserved in copies that had been cast from them in plaster. Except for the wax Little Fourteen-Year-Old Dancer (Washington: NGA) none of these sculptures had been publicly exhibited during the artist’s lifetime.Although Degas had not favored reproducing his sculptures in more permanent materials, his heirs authorized that copies be cast in bronze in order to preserve the compositions and to sell them as finished works. Paul-Albert Bartholomé, a sculptor and Degas's longtime friend, prepared 72 of the figures for casting, a process executed by the distinguished Paris foundry A.-A. Hébrard et Cie. The quality of the Degas bronzes was tightly controlled and their edition was limited. Only twenty-two editions of the series of 72 figures were cast. Each bronze within the series was assigned a number from one to seventy-two. The first twenty editions were assigned a letter from A-T. In most cases these numbers and letters were incised on the individual bronzes.The series of 72 bronzes was completed before May 1921 when it was exhibited in Paris. Edition A, comprising the first and best casts of the series, was reserved for the important Impressionist collector Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer.

The château, situated on a hillside overlooking the Seine not far from Paris, became the queen's favorite summer residence. Built in the sixteenth century and rebuilt during the seventeenth, the palace was in need of renovation. The architect Richard Mique (1728–1794) enlarged and altered it, and appropriate furnishings were ordered for the queen's apartment.Many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sené (1748–1803), a member of an important dynasty of Parisian chair makers who received a royal appointment in 1784. Sené provided a set of seat furniture for the queen's dressing room, called her cabinet particulier ox cabinet de toilette that is described in the 1789 inventory of Saint Cloud. The daybed (41.205.1), the bergère (a comfortable chair upholstered between the arms and the seat, 41.205.2), and the fire screen (41.205.3a, b) from the set are now in the Museum's collections. They were the gift of Ann Payne Blumenthal, the second wife of George Blumenthal. The painted and gilt frame of the low daybed is embellished with floral motifs. Six short tapering and fluted legs surmounted by Ionic capitals support the piece. The front stiles of the head- and footboard, which are of equal height, are carved with female half-figures wearing Egyptian headdresses. The bergère, which has a medallion with Marie Antoinette's initials on its top rail, is decorated in a similar manner. A decade before Napoleon's North African campaign was to inspire the fashion known as égyptomanie, the queen appears to have had a taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art. Seated classical female figures, rather than Egyptian caryatids, decorate the feet of the fire screen, and a woman who once held a cornucopia reclines on its top. The carver is not known, but Louis-François Chatard (ca. 1749–1819) was responsible for painting and gilding the frames.According to the 1789 inventory the set was originally upholstered in a white-twilled cotton with rows of individual flowers embroidered by the queen herself.

The 1601 inventory of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury (1527—1608), included two quilts that were almost certainly products of this trade: ""a quilt of yellow India stuff embroidered with birds and beasts"" and ""a quilt of India stuff embroidered with beastes.""¹ Indian quilts of the type produced for the Portuguese market appeared with increasing frequency in London sales into the 1620s, when their value began to decline, perhaps because of diminishing novelty.²The taste for Indian-style embroidery remained, however, and it is interesting to note that the English maker of another bedcover in the Museum's collection (MMA 34.104.1) used not only the Indian palette of golden yellow on white but also an imported Indian cotton as the foundation. The cover has rare seventeenth-century marks on the plain-weave cotton fabric: the initials G.C.E. (for the English East India Company's original name, The Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies) as well as three other stamps whose significance has not yet been deciphered.³ On that bedcover, the embroidered designs draw heavily on such exotic motifs as pineapple-like vegetation and serrated leaves, but contemporary European sensibilities are also evident in the strapwork connecting the floral elements. Additionally, the three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the use of stitches with long floats that create a shinier surface to contrast with the matte appearance of the cotton ground diverge from the Indian prototypes, whose flatter chain stitches are less glossy. English bedcovers were usually part of coordinated sets that could include bolsters, pillows, and matching valances.⁴In addition to the more common monochrome yellow-on white embroideries, Indian polychrome embroideries also arrived in England during the early seventeenth century. They, too, are described in sale records; for example, a 1614 sale included ""a carpet or quilt embroidered upon calico with sundry silks.""⁵ The word ""carpet"" is probably used in its contemporaneous sense, that is, to signify decorative covers for a variety of furniture types, including beds. This textile, an English polychrome silk and metal-thread bedcover, is more obviously dependent on the stylistic composition of Persian and Turkish carpets than MMA 34.104.1.  By the eighteenth century, both embroidered and painted cotton textiles of this type, with a central medallion and smaller medallions in the corners of the central field, were being made in India for domestic consumption and for export (see e.g. Winterthur Museum no. 1963.0048 and Victoria and Albert Museum no. IS.46-1956).⁶ These imported polychrome covers had a lasting influence on the production of English embroidered bed furnishings of the eighteenth century.

This series included portraits of Louis XIV, his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, marquise de Montespan (1641 – 1707 ), and six of their children, all shown as deities. The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers. The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds. Various birds, insects, and wind instruments are rendered around this medallion, while a sunburst is shown above and Juno with peacock below. The closeness of the depiction of Louis XIV to an image of the king painted on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles by Charles Le Brun in 1683 – 84 makes it likely that the designs for the main figures in the set of hangings were supplied by his workshop; however, they may be the work of the painter François Bonnemer (1638 – 1689 ), who is known to have made cartoons after compositions by Le Brun. In 1685 Bonnemer provided designs for the embroidered seat covers of the benches and stools in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alentours, or decorative borders, full of delightful details, are believed to be by Jean Lemoyen le Lorrain, an artist little known today who worked in the circle of Le Brun.The other embroideries are thought to depict three of Montespan’s children with the king: Louise-Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes (1673 – 1743 ), with flowers symbolizing Flora, or spring (MMA 46.43.1); Françoise-Marie, Mademoiselle de Blois (1677 – 1749 ), with wheat ears, as Ceres, or summer (MMA 46.43.2); and Louis-Auguste, duc de Maine (1670 – 1736 ), in armor, as Mars, or fire (MMA 46.43.3).The compositions of the seasons include floral wreaths with the zodiac symbols for the appropriate months, while salamanders, torches, smoking braziers, and censers pertain to the element fire. The background of these rare surviving embroideries is worked in metal thread, now tarnished, which must have given them a sumptuous and shimmering appearance when they were first made. The hangings were documented in 1718 as in the collection of Louis-Alexandre, comte de Toulouse (1678 – 1737 ), the youngest child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, at the Château de Rambouillet. During the nineteenth century they belonged to King Louis-Philippe and were hung at the Palais Royal, Paris.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, adapted from The Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts/Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide and Jeffrey Munger; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010]",Embroidery

A description of one example in Lazare Duvaux’s account book suggests that this elegant folding table was used for quadrille. On August 9, 1753, the dealer sold a solid mahogany quadrille table ""I"" (folding on the diagonal), embellished with gilt bronze, and lined with cloth, to Madame de Pompadour for 85 livres.[1]When closed, the Museum’s table has a triangular shape and forms a synthesis of sinuous lines, echoed by the double curve of the cabriole legs. One of these S-shaped legs can be pulled backward to support the hinged top when unfolded. A shallow walnut drawer for storage of game essentials is recessed on top of this sliding leg. The rounded corners of the open top could be used for discarded cards and counters or for the placement of candlesticks to offer the players light on their game.

Prince-bishop of Würzburg and, after 1757, also of Bamberg, Seinsheim divided his time between two official residences in those cities and his three summer castles, Veitschöchheim, Werneck, and Seehof.[1] Preferring the country to the city, Seinsheim spent about three months a year outside Bamberg, at Seehof, where he enjoyed walking and hunting. He was fond of gardens and did much to embellish the late-seventeenth-century castle and especially its park, where he ordered that a maze, a theater, and a cascade with grotto and trelliswork arcades be constructed.In 1761 he also resumed work on one of the ancillary buildings at Seehof, the Franckenstein Schlösschen. This garden pavilion at the east end of the orangery and greenhouses had been conceived as a place where the prince could retreat from the strict etiquette at his court. Built by the architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel (1703–1769) for one of Seinsheim's predecessors, Johann Philipp Anton von Franckenstein, prince-bishop from 1746 to 1753, the Schlösschen had been left unfinished at the time of Franckenstein's death. Contemporary records indicate that Seinsheim decided to have its two main rooms, the Saal and the Audience Chamber (also called the Arbor Room, or berceau), embellished with frescoes and stuccowork. All four walls of the Audience Chamber were to be decorated as an illusionary arbor with trelliswork and floral festoons. Franz Anton Ermeltraut, court painter at Würzburg, was commissioned to execute a small trompe l'oeil ceiling fresco. It is not known when this was finished because the work was delayed by occasional disputes between the patron and the painter and the latter's frequent illnesses.[2] No description of the room's interior was made when the Franckenstein Pavilion was demolished in the nineteenth century, but a drawing thought to be Ermeltraut's design for the Arbor Room has been preserved, illustrating its intended decoration.[3] Also, an inventory of 1774 at Schloss Seehof mentions a ""Grünes Perceau-zimmer,"" or Green Trelliswork Room, in the garden pavilion, showing that the room had been completed by then as planned.Among the furnishings listed were the two settees, together with a pair of matching armchairs and four side chairs that are also in the Museum's collection.[5] In addition, there were four wall brackets hanging in niches, two of which have been preserved as well.[6] These furnishings were described as ""von bildhauer Arbeith grün Lassirt,"" or carved and glazed green.Both the settees and the matching chairs have serpentine gilded frames consisting of large scrolls of various shapes and openwork aprons decorated with polychrome flowers and foliage. They are supported on slightly curved legs carved with a pattern of reeds, and rest on bun feet that are partly covered by foliage. Most unusual is the off-white studded latticework intertwined with gilded and painted foliage on the inner backs of the seats; this must have been in total harmony with the original setting of the furniture. The outer backs of the settees and armchairs were left unfinished, as they were intended to stand against the wall; the side chairs, however, have latticework carving on both sides and were meant to be seen in the round. Corresponding to the inventory description of 1774, traces of a green glaze, originally applied over the gilding, are still present on the furniture.[7] Subsequent inventories offer additional details about the pieces, mentioning their green silk-velvet seat cushions and their placement.[8] Being rather top-heavy and unsteady, the settees stood in two corners of the room and the armchairs are described as being fastened in the other two. Grooves in the outer backs of the settees seem to imply that they too were once secured to the walls of the room.It is, unfortunately, not known who was the maker of this unique garden-room furniture so expressive of the exuberant Rococo taste. Its sculptural silhouette and elaborate carving, the choice of linden wood, and the unusual construction and simple joinery all make it seem likely that a sculptor or master carver rather than a cabinetmaker was responsible for the set.[9] It has been suggested that Margravine Sophie Caroline von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1737–1817), of neighboring Bayreuth, presented the suite to Seinsheim.[10] This would explain the absence of bills in Seehof's archival records. The margravine is known to have visited Seinsheim regularly, and pieces of furniture were occasionally exchanged between them. Also in favor of a Bayreuth provenance is the florid style of the pieces: Rococo furniture of Bayreuth was characterized by unrestricted use of naturalistic motifs, such as flowers, foliage, reeds, and birds. There was also a preference in Bayreuth for naturalism in interiors. Several rooms in the more recent of Bayreuth's two castles, the Neues Schloss, were decorated before 1760 in imitation of latticework pavilions, the first examples of their kind in Germany.[11] A complete set of furniture would have been an unusually large gift, however. Since the Museum's suite was in such perfect harmony with its original setting, and given Seinsheim's attention to the smallest details of Seehof's embellishments, it seems more likely that the prince-bishop ordered it himself. With the exception of a corner settee in the Würzburg Residenz, no other pieces known today bear even the slightest resemblance to the Seehof set.[12] For this reason, and in the absence of contemporary documents, it is impossible to attribute the furniture to a specific artist.The settees, chairs, and wall brackets presumably remained in the Franckenstein Pavilion until it was pulled down, between 1867 and 1870, and were then transferred to the castle itself. Seehof, which was in the possession of the bishopric and then part of the Bavarian royal domain until 1842, had become the private property of Freiherr Friedrich von Zandt and his descendants. Photographs taken at the turn of the century and later show the furniture in the Zandt family dining room.[13] They indicate that large carved flowers, now missing, originally adorned the cresting of the frames. The castle survived World War II intact, but the interior furnishings were sold off after the death in 1951 of the last male heir of the Zandt family.[14] In 1956 the Munich antiques dealer Fischer-Böhler sold this exceptional seat furniture to the New York collector Emma A. Sheafer. At that time the chairs and settees were upholstered in eighteenth-century painted Chinese silk, and only the trelliswork carving on the outer backs of the side chairs was left uncovered. Mrs. Sheafer never knew the full splendor of the furniture that filled the dining room of her New York City apartment. It was with their painted silk show covers that the furniture came to the Museum as part of her bequest in 1973. Once the fabric had been taken off, a conservation campaign was undertaken. This included the reconstruction of the foliage around the inner edge of the frames, which had been cut away to accommodate the upholstery; the removal of later paint layers on the trelliswork; and the manufacture of seat cushions covered in velvet to match the originals.[15][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide 2006]Footnotes:[1] Much of the information in this entry is taken from Kisluk-Grosheide 1990.

They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through.

Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately.

The chasuble's embroidered decoration-a nearly symmetrical pattern of full-blown, seminaturalistic flowers, small blossoms, curving leaves, and scrolls—is an excellent example of the style of late Baroque ornament used to embellish Italian vestments from the end of the seventeenth century to the middle years of the eighteenth. The robust flowers, worked in long and short stitches, French knots, and metallic loops, are carefully modeled in four to five shades of silk. The metallic thread is primarily used in laid and couched work, cursively following the contours of the motifs and secured in twill or chevron patterns with yellow silk. Although it is often impossible to identify the specific place of manufacture of such embroideries, documentation accompanying this gift proposes western Sicily. Attestations given in 1915 in Partanna and Mazara del Vallo state that according to tradition this set of vestments was a gift to Nicolo Spedaliere (also recorded as Spitaleri), head priest of the mother church of Partanna, from his bishop.

Although such beadwork baskets clearly did not lend themselves to this kind of practical use, their imagery is also usually celebratory and commemorative of marriage or betrothal. Such is the case with this piece, which celebrates the union in 1662 of King Charles II and Catherine of Braganza. They stand in the center of the satin panel, surrounded by a profusion of fruits and flowers that is generally suggestive of fecundity, although such elements as the butterflies, a radiant sun, and an oak sapling may have been chosen for their specifically Royalist associations. In this context, the peacock at the center beneath the royal couple may be an emblem of the Restoration, as the peacock’s traditionally incorruptible body was associated with rebirth and resurrection. The four female figures who stand around the royal couple are the Four Continents, identifiable by the creatures that accompany them. Europe with a stag stands at top left, Asia with a leopard at top right. The lower register is less clear because of the interchangeability of the figures’ attributes, but nonetheless the griffin probably represents Africa and the cockatrice America (see also MMA, 39.13.2a). The placement of the royal couple at the center of the Four Continents was to situate their union within the wider compass of a divinely appointed natural order.A number of very similar beadwork baskets survive from the third quarter of the seventeenth century and share the same essential structure: a rectangular frame made from heavy gauge wire, spherical feet, and everted sides extending outward from the base, with regular intervals of wire of the same gauge forming square openings. The handles are bent in a trefoil shape and extend from the center of each of the four sides. The wire is wrapped in variegated colored patterns of beads.It has been suggested that the introduction of beadwork into English embroidery was related to a growing trade with the Far East, Africa, and the Americas. Glass beads, or ""bugles,"" were produced on a large scale in Venice and Amsterdam in the seventeenth century and shipped in quantity to ports near London, where they were destined to be traded for fine materials that were imported to Europe. Joan Edwards speculated that the use of these beads in embroidery must have developed suddenly after the 1630s when this trade first began. She posited that haberdashers, merchants, or bead traders, who often also sold wire, realized the market potential of the use of such beads in women’s embroidery. Many raised-work pictures of the period also incorporate glass beads, demonstrating an appetite for the unusual and exuberant.It is probable that baskets of this kind were made by professionals or perhaps sold as kits. Certainly, it is likely that the intricate and lifelike fruits were professionally produced. Even the king and queen are produced on a slip of canvas and were probably prefabricated. This is substantiated by a strikingly similar basket, from the Untermyer collection, now at Colonial Williamsburg, which has the same form of frame and whose applied fruits and flowers with an identically posed king and queen are worked in the same beaded pattern and colors.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",Embroidery

This type of composition is often associated with the influence of Portuguese and Spanish models, although there are some earlier Asian examples that employ this format as well.² Wholly Asian in subject and style, however, are the motifs. The pair of phoenixes at the center of the textile encircle a large peony. Similar dynamically posed birds are also seen in an architectural stone relief excavated from the Yuan dynasty (1271–1368) capital and now in the National Museum of China, Beijing, as well as in a corresponding textile in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum,³ and peonies often figure in Ming rank badges, in which a pair of birds encircle a flower. Within the rectangular field are flowers and four more birds -- two golden pheasants and two peacocks, which were used as insignia for the second and third civil ranks in both Ming and Qing China. The multiple borders surrounding the central field include a wide border embroidered with various animals—rare creatures such as a tiger and elephant in addition to the familiar horse, deer, and goat, all of which are depicted side by side with such distinctively mythical Chinese beasts as a blue qilin and a white, singlehorned xiezhi. A composite animal with hooves and usually a single horn, the qilin is mentioned in poetry as early as the Han dynasty (206 b.c.–a.d. 220),⁴ its appearance was sometimes said to signal the birth of a sage, and it was used as a rank insignia for nobles. The xiezhi also appears in Han dynasty texts; known for its ability to distinguish virtue from evil, it used its sharp teeth and single horn to bite and gore wrongdoers, and it was the insignia for the censorate, which included judges. Here, both animals have flames shooting off their bodies, indicating their supernatural powers. Embroideries of this type were made for export, and a number have been preserved in Japan and Europe in historical contexts. The oldest documented example is an altar cloth in Saikyo￣ ji, a temple in Kyoto; it was donated in 1616.⁵ Another example, now in the Museo Diocesano, Chiavari, Italy, was donated to a church in Chiavari in 1651 and used as a baldachin, or canopy, for the clergy.⁶  Others are preserved in museum collections.⁷Chinese textiles and other goods came to the Americas via the Manila galleons’ annual trips between Acapulco (and Callao, the port city of Lima) and the Philippines. While to date no preserved embroideries from this group have been found in Mexico or Peru, their influence was present there by the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century,⁸ as evident in the similar layout and motifs of a Peruvian tapestry in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 33).⁹[Melinda Watt, adapted from Interwoven Globe, The Worldwide Textile Trade, 1500-1800/ edited by Amelia Peck; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: distributed by Yale University Press, 2013] 1.

In the early seventeenth century they also fetched high prices at auctions in England and seem to have influenced the production of embroidery there (see MMA 34.104.1 and MMA 1970.173). Characterized by the use of yellow tussah silk embroidery on a white cotton ground, they typically depict a combination of classical, biblical, and Hindu themes, although a few draw from other sources (see e.g. Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, no. T20e4). This colcha is embellished with a selection of vignettes found on several others, including an almost identical example in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon.² Successive bands around the border depict a hunt, the Labors of Hercules, and the story of Arion, while the center panel features the Judgment of Solomon surrounded by stories from the book of Judith: the siege of Bethulia (bottom right), Judith before Holofernes (top right), Judith beheads Holofernes (top left), and the severed head of Holofernes displayed from the walls of Bethulia (bottom left). Vignettes from classical mythology include Actaeon transformed into a stag by Diana (above the Solomon scene), Hercules shooting the Lernean Hydra (detail), and the story of Phaeton, who drove the chariot of the sun too close to Earth, scorching the planet and causing the animals to die (in the triangular panel below Hercules). While the themes of these coverlets can be generally related to contemporary European tapestries and textiles, which also mix biblical and classical tales, the depiction of the protagonists in seventeenth-century Portuguese garb and the addition of Hindu imagery (such as the story of the Vishnu avatar Matsya, the fishtailed figure in the second band from the center) must represent the traditions and imagination of the embroiderers who created them. The circulation of northern European prints and illustrated Bibles at the Mughal court is well documented, but the sources available to the Bengali embroiderers remain obscure and probably represent an entirely different category of material. The inventiveness of the embroidery is further underscored by comparison to those made for the local market. Two pieces that likely date to the late sixteenth or early seventeenth century are embroidered in multicolored silk, and their design is composed of circular medallions enclosing lotus patterns, interlocking star shapes, and bands of human figures and animals.³ Here, then, the switch to an almost monochrome yellow and white palette, the composition of concentric panels and bands, and the addition of foreign iconography were innovations for this particular type of export, which was produced only until the mid-seventeenth century.

Its border illustrates incidents taken from the first six tapestries of the set, embroidered in tent stitch using wool and silk in brilliant red, pink, blue, and dark blue-green colors. The tablecloth is also based on a set of eight woodcuts by John Le Clerc, made about 1587, which are thought to have been copied from the tapestry series. The widespread popularity of the story is apparent from the number of its depictions that have survived.The scenes shown extol the ideal pleasures of Arcadian life. Macée washes her feet in a stream and later raids a bird's nest with Gombaut in a scene taken from the first tapestry. Then they play tiquet, a game similar to croquet, and a man smacks a girl. A bagpipe player performs, the two shepherds dance, and they feast on biscuits, water, and strawberries in scenes taken from the third and fourth tapestries. Finally, Gombaut is betrothed to Macée and marries her in scenes from the fifth and sixth tapestries. Several scenes found in the tapestries are omitted in the embroidery, including the shepherds as children chasing butterflies and the onslaught of wolves that causes Gombaut's unfortunate death and concludes the story. Gombaut's later life is rarely shown in illustrations of the story; the sad approach of death is not in keeping with the idyllic pastoral theme.

The proportions of this example indicate that it was used over a table rather than on a bed. The floral designs—elegant Renaissance-style scrolling vines with carnations, irises, and other flowers as well as hummingbirds seeking nectar—are constructed with brilliant yellow silk embroidered on a natural linen ground (outlines in brown tannin ink, drawn for the embroiderers to follow, are still visible in some areas). The golden yellow color, a favorite in Iberia for textiles, was derived from weld, a local dyeplant that thrived in the region and was relied on for its brilliance and durability.¹ Although the contrast between the yellow silk and the ecru ground echoes that of certain Indian embroideries made in Bengal and imported into Portugal and Spain in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (see MMA1975.4, MMA 23.203.1), the ease of the design and the variety in stitch type (including satin, chain, and stem as well as various kinds of knots and filling stitches) help identify this as a European cover. The configuration of the cover’s decorative elements constitutes a basic format that may have originated in Islamic Spain. In particular, the large central field with a series of outer borders, including a broad center border flanked, or ""protected,"" by narrower guard borders on either side, was an established style for carpets throughout the Islamic world and one that influenced other regional textile designs, notably Spanish embroidery (the demarcation of the four outer corners in this example may, however, be more Iberian than Islamic in character). This design approach, in turn, was transmitted around the world via Spanish and Portuguese colonial administration and trade, from tapestries made by Andean weavers in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Peru (see MMA 56.163) to Asian and Indian embroideries intended for the European market (see MMA 1975.208d). Given the shared heritage of Portugal and Spain, especially during the sixteenth century, when both countries were united under a single ruler, it can be difficult to differentiate the embroidery production of one from the other.² Both regions had longstanding traditions of fine textiles, from folk works to commissions made by professional guilds for the Church and royal court. This example lies somewhere in between: although the cover was intended for actual household use, its intricate style and high quality suggest that it was made for a person of means and status.

The Portuguese were the first Europeans to enter this market, but most surviving Gujarati embroideries relate to trade with England, which increased in the early seventeenth century.¹ Over the course of the seventeenth century, as the Gujarati embroiderers adjusted their output for the English market, they adopted the common motif of pink flowers detailed in yellow that bloom from dark green vines with light green or yellow veins. In the background are spotted leopards, striped deer, squirrels, birds, and other chain-stitched beasts filled with bands of color or details in contrasting hues. These elements are understood to have been culled from a variety of sources including English embroideries, examples of which must have been sent to India as models (see e.g. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, nos. 53.2202 and 53.172). But as English embroidery was itself responding to the influx of Asian textiles, incorporating and adapting many foreign motifs, the result was a mix of European, Indian, and Chinese imagery that then fed back to its original sources in a totally transformed state. This piece, consisting of several panels that have been joined and then quilted to form a bed-size coverlet, includes the motifs found on seventeenth-century coverlets but must have been made in the early eighteenth century, when an overall pattern of rinceaux enclosing flowers became more common.² However, Gujarati production is remarkable for its variety; at the same time, embroiderers were also producing patterns related to French bizarre silks and palampore designs (see e.g. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, no. 57.168).

The château, situated on a hillside overlooking the Seine not far from Paris, became the queen's favorite summer residence. Built in the sixteenth century and rebuilt during the seventeenth, the palacewas in need of renovation. The architect Richard Mique (1728-1794) enlarged and altered it, and appropriate furnishings were ordered for the queen's apartment.Many pieces of furniture were commissioned from Jean-Baptiste-Claude Sene (1748-1803), a member of an important dynasty of Parisian chair makers who received a royal appointment in 1784. Sene provided a set of seat furniture for the queen's dressing room, called her cabinet particulier ox cabinet de toilette that is described in the 1789 inventory of Saint Cloud. The daybed, the bergère (a comfortable chair upholstered between the arms and the seat), and the fire screen from the set are now in the Museum's collections (figs. 50?57). They were the gift of Ann Payne Blumenthal, the second wife of George Blumenthal. The painted and gilt frame of the low daybed (fig. 50) is embellished with floral motifs. Six short tapering and fluted legs surmounted by Ionic capitals support the piece. The front stiles of the head- and footboard, which are of equal height, are carved with female half-figures wearing Egyptian headdresses (fig. 51). The berg?re (fig. 52), which has a medallion with Marie Antoinette's initials on its top rail (fig. 53), is decorated in a similar manner. A decade before Napoleon's North African campaign was to inspire the fashion known as égyptomanie, the queen appears to have had a taste for ornament derived from ancient Egyptian art. Seated classical female figures, rather than Egyptian caryatids, decorate the feet of the fire screen (figs. 54, 55), and a woman who once held a cornucopia reclines on its top. The carver is not known, but Louis-François Chatard (ca. 1749-1819) was responsible for painting and gilding the frames.According to the 1789 inventory the set was originally upholstered in a white-twilledcotton with rows of individual flowers embroidered by the queen herself.

By the 1580s portraits of Queen Elizabeth I and several of her courtiers show the sitters wearing embroidered sleeves decorated with an early version of this pattern in monochrome thread (usually black) on white linen.¹  Examples like this coif, made of linen embroidered with polychrome silk and metal threads, were first produced about 1600. This popular scrolling pattern appeared on both men’s and women’s headgear, women’s jackets, and furnishing textiles. The design, which may derive from similar motifs found in Islamic Spain, remained fashionable in England at least until the 1620s.² Features like the small diaper patterns used to fill the interiors of individual leaves and flower petals in blackwork embroidery and the striped or shaded leaves and petals like those seen here continued to be employed in English crewel embroidery of the later seventeenth century. These features are also found in some of the earlier surviving Indian chintz patterns produced for export to Europe. English embroidery patterns and Continental verdure tapestries were sources that contributed to the creation of the lush floral designs seen in late seventeenth- and early eighteenth-century Indian chintz.³ A miniature version of a scrolling floral pattern appears in one of the earliest surviving Indian chintzes, found on the walls of the circa 1677 dollhouse of Petronella Dunois (1650–1695), now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam (no. BK-14656)⁴  A sarasa for the Japanese market (see MMA 2010.55), another type of Indian cotton, also displays this type of pattern, and a much larger-scale variation that includes exotic animals appears on an Indian embroidered bedcover (see MMA 68.61).A number of ornament prints, such as the German artist Bernhard Zan’s design of 1581 (see MMA 20.8.1), could have served as models for European embroideries. Like the rinceaux design itself, ornament prints often had extended periods of use and were circulated and copied long after their original invention. While there is to date no concrete evidence that designs or textiles of this exact type were sent to Indian craftsmen to copy, the practice of sending patterns to India is well documented, and it seems likely that versions of such successful patterns as the European rinceaux with flowers influenced Indian textile production for the international market.

This series included portraits of Louis XIV, his mistress Françoise-Athénaïs de Rochechouart, marquise de Montespan (1641 – 1707 ), and six of their children, all shown as deities. The hangings were probably worked at the convent of the Filles de Saint-Joseph in Paris, which was under the patronage of Madame de Montespan, and where she retired in 1691. At this religious community, orphan girls were educated in the art of needlepoint, and a number of royal embroidery projects for use at Versailles were executed there, with the additional assistance of professional embroiderers. The Museum’s four panels are believed to have been commissioned by Madame de Montespan about the time the king transferred his affections from her to Françoise d’Aubigny, marquise de Maintenon (1635 – 1719 ), whom he was to marry in 1685.The central medallion in the panel that symbolizes air (MMA 46.43.4) features the king himself in the guise of Jupiter, holding a thunderbolt and a shield emblazoned with the head of the Gorgon Medusa and seated on a large eagle against a backdrop of billowing clouds. Various birds, insects, and wind instruments are rendered around this medallion, while a sunburst is shown above and Juno with peacock below. The closeness of the depiction of Louis XIV to an image of the king painted on the ceiling of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles by Charles Le Brun in 1683 – 84 makes it likely that the designs for the main figures in the set of hangings were supplied by his workshop; however, they may be the work of the painter François Bonnemer (1638 – 1689 ), who is known to have made cartoons after compositions by Le Brun. In 1685 Bonnemer provided designs for the embroidered seat covers of the benches and stools in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. The alentours, or decorative borders, full of delightful details, are believed to be by Jean Lemoyen le Lorrain, an artist little known today who worked in the circle of Le Brun.The other embroideries are thought to depict three of Montespan’s children with the king: Louise-Françoise, Mademoiselle de Nantes (1673 – 1743 ), with flowers symbolizing Flora, or spring (MMA 46.43.1); Françoise-Marie, Mademoiselle de Blois (1677 – 1749 ), with wheat ears, as Ceres, or summer (MMA 46.43.2); and Louis-Auguste, duc de Maine (1670 – 1736 ), in armor, as Mars, or fire (MMA 46.43.3).The compositions of the seasons include floral wreaths with the zodiac symbols for the appropriate months, while salamanders, torches, smoking braziers, and censers pertain to the element fire. The background of these rare surviving embroideries is worked in metal thread, now tarnished, which must have given them a sumptuous and shimmering appearance when they were first made. The hangings were documented in 1718 as in the collection of Louis-Alexandre, comte de Toulouse (1678 – 1737 ), the youngest child of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan, at the Château de Rambouillet. During the nineteenth century they belonged to King Louis-Philippe and were hung at the Palais Royal, Paris.[Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide, adapted from The Wrightsman Galleries for French Decorative Arts/Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide and Jeffrey Munger; New York: Metropolitan Museum of Art; New Haven: Yale University Press, 2010]",Embroidery
http://data.silknow.org/object/9924bf9d-5f72-31ac-9313-180f959434c3,met,"Part of a larger set, this remarkable corner settee and its pair, also in the Museum, were commissioned by one of the most powerful figures in eighteenth-century Franconia, Adam Friedrich von Seinsheim (1708–1779). Prince-bishop of Würzburg and, after 1757, also of Bamberg, Seinsheim divided his time between two official residences in those cities and his three summer castles, Veitschöchheim, Werneck, and Seehof.[1] Preferring the country to the city, Seinsheim spent about three months a year outside Bamberg, at Seehof, where he enjoyed walking and hunting. He was fond of gardens and did much to embellish the late-seventeenth-century castle and especially its park, where he ordered that a maze, a theater, and a cascade with grotto and trelliswork arcades be constructed.In 1761 he also resumed work on one of the ancillary buildings at Seehof, the Franckenstein Schlösschen. This garden pavilion at the east end of the orangery and greenhouses had been conceived as a place where the prince could retreat from the strict etiquette at his court. Built by the architect Johann Jakob Michael Küchel (1703–1769) for one of Seinsheim's predecessors, Johann Philipp Anton von Franckenstein, prince-bishop from 1746 to 1753, the Schlösschen had been left unfinished at the time of Franckenstein's death. Contemporary records indicate that Seinsheim decided to have its two main rooms, the Saal and the Audience Chamber (also called the Arbor Room, or berceau), embellished with frescoes and stuccowork. All four walls of the Audience Chamber were to be decorated as an illusionary arbor with trelliswork and floral festoons. Franz Anton Ermeltraut, court painter at Würzburg, was commissioned to execute a small trompe l'oeil ceiling fresco. It is not known when this was finished because the work was delayed by occasional disputes between the patron and the painter and the latter's frequent illnesses.[2] No description of the room's interior was made when the Franckenstein Pavilion was demolished in the nineteenth century, but a drawing thought to be Ermeltraut's design for the Arbor Room has been preserved, illustrating its intended decoration.[3] Also, an inventory of 1774 at Schloss Seehof mentions a ""Grünes Perceau-zimmer,"" or Green Trelliswork Room, in the garden pavilion, showing that the room had been completed by then as planned.Among the furnishings listed were the two settees, together with a pair of matching armchairs and four side chairs that are also in the Museum's collection.[5] In addition, there were four wall brackets hanging in niches, two of which have been preserved as well.[6] These furnishings were described as ""von bildhauer Arbeith grün Lassirt,"" or carved and glazed green.Both the settees and the matching chairs have serpentine gilded frames consisting of large scrolls of various shapes and openwork aprons decorated with polychrome flowers and foliage. They are supported on slightly curved legs carved with a pattern of reeds, and rest on bun feet that are partly covered by foliage. Most unusual is the off-white studded latticework intertwined with gilded and painted foliage on the inner backs of the seats; this must have been in total harmony with the original setting of the furniture. The outer backs of the settees and armchairs were left unfinished, as they were intended to stand against the wall; the side chairs, however, have latticework carving on both sides and were meant to be seen in the round. Corresponding to the inventory description of 1774, traces of a green glaze, originally applied over the gilding, are still present on the furniture.[7] Subsequent inventories offer additional details about the pieces, mentioning their green silk-velvet seat cushions and their placement.[8] Being rather top-heavy and unsteady, the settees stood in two corners of the room and the armchairs are described as being fastened in the other two. Grooves in the outer backs of the settees seem to imply that they too were once secured to the walls of the room.It is, unfortunately, not known who was the maker of this unique garden-room furniture so expressive of the exuberant Rococo taste. Its sculptural silhouette and elaborate carving, the choice of linden wood, and the unusual construction and simple joinery all make it seem likely that a sculptor or master carver rather than a cabinetmaker was responsible for the set.[9] It has been suggested that Margravine Sophie Caroline von Braunschweig-Wolfenbüttel (1737–1817), of neighboring Bayreuth, presented the suite to Seinsheim.[10] This would explain the absence of bills in Seehof's archival records. The margravine is known to have visited Seinsheim regularly, and pieces of furniture were occasionally exchanged between them. Also in favor of a Bayreuth provenance is the florid style of the pieces: Rococo furniture of Bayreuth was characterized by unrestricted use of naturalistic motifs, such as flowers, foliage, reeds, and birds. There was also a preference in Bayreuth for naturalism in interiors. Several rooms in the more recent of Bayreuth's two castles, the Neues Schloss, were decorated before 1760 in imitation of latticework pavilions, the first examples of their kind in Germany.[11] A complete set of furniture would have been an unusually large gift, however. Since the Museum's suite was in such perfect harmony with its original setting, and given Seinsheim's attention to the smallest details of Seehof's embellishments, it seems more likely that the prince-bishop ordered it himself. With the exception of a corner settee in the Würzburg Residenz, no other pieces known today bear even the slightest resemblance to the Seehof set.[12] For this reason, and in the absence of contemporary documents, it is impossible to attribute the furniture to a specific artist.The settees, chairs, and wall brackets presumably remained in the Franckenstein Pavilion until it was pulled down, between 1867 and 1870, and were then transferred to the castle itself. Seehof, which was in the possession of the bishopric and then part of the Bavarian royal domain until 1842, had become the private property of Freiherr Friedrich von Zandt and his descendants. Photographs taken at the turn of the century and later show the furniture in the Zandt family dining room.[13] They indicate that large carved flowers, now missing, originally adorned the cresting of the frames. The castle survived World War II intact, but the interior furnishings were sold off after the death in 1951 of the last male heir of the Zandt family.[14] In 1956 the Munich antiques dealer Fischer-Böhler sold this exceptional seat furniture to the New York collector Emma A. Sheafer. At that time the chairs and settees were upholstered in eighteenth-century painted Chinese silk, and only the trelliswork carving on the outer backs of the side chairs was left uncovered. Mrs. Sheafer never knew the full splendor of the furniture that filled the dining room of her New York City apartment. It was with their painted silk show covers that the furniture came to the Museum as part of her bequest in 1973. Once the fabric had been taken off, a conservation campaign was undertaken. This included the reconstruction of the foliage around the inner edge of the frames, which had been cut away to accommodate the upholstery; the removal of later paint layers on the trelliswork; and the manufacture of seat cushions covered in velvet to match the originals.[15][Daniëlle Kisluk-Grosheide 2006]Footnotes:[1] Much of the information in this entry is taken from Kisluk-Grosheide 1990.

They were originally fitted on top with vase-shaped carvings, which are now in the collection of the Bayerische Verwaltung der Staatlichen Schlösser, Gärten und Seen, Munich. The other two brackets and their tops were most likely used to construct a late-nineteenth-century center table to match the seat furniture. This table, which is also in the Museum's collection (acc. no. 1974.356.122), is on long-term loan to Schloss Seehof.[7] Copper was used for this glaze, which would have been applied in a variety of transparent-to-opaque green tones that would allow the gilding to partially shine through.

Unusual also is the way that the chairs were constructed. Normally the back supports would have formed one piece with the back legs. Here they were made like stools, with the backs attached separately.

Originally, these curtains may have been part of a larger suite of furnishings for the decoration of an entire bedroom–a canape (settee) now in the private rooms of Madame de Maintenon at Fontainebleau has very similar embroidered designs.¹ The complete set of bed hangings probably included matching upper valances for the tester, lower valances for the frame supporting the mattresses, and a coordinating bedcover and headcloth, like the set of French bedroom furnishings now in the Metropolitan Museum (see MMA 53.2.1a-d, .2a-d). Oversize fanciful flora, a design element familiar from the so-called bizarre silks, are joined in these curtains by human figures dressed in vaguely Chinese garments, imaginary Asian winged dragons, and pairs of long-tailed birds. Early chinoiseriestyle furnishings, made in sturdy tent and cross stitches on canvas, were used over a wide geographic area in northern Europe during the first half of the eighteenth century, and a good number have survived.² The Metropolitan’s side curtains, with their yellow background, are most likely French, as extant examples of the yellow or pale backgrounds are associated with production or use in France. To date, no documentation regarding the commission or production for these various suites of furnishings has been discovered, though we know that another such group was probably ordered from Paris in 1721 for Favorite Palace in Ludwigsburg, Germany, the summer residence of Sybilla Augusta, margravine of Baden-Baden (1675–1733).³ Most of these embroideries, however, were worked on a dark background, either blue or black, and are therefore more closely connected with the aesthetic of English tapestries from the likes of John Vanderbank, with their reference to the dark backgrounds of Asian lacquer screens (see MMA 53.165.2). No design drawings or sources have been identified for these embroideries, which, like the Vanderbank tapestries, are decorative pastiches probably taking inspiration from the same variety of sources employed by contemporary tapestry designers, including imported fabrics and their European counterparts, the bizarre silks.⁴ A feature of Chinese art that confounded and intrigued European observers is very much present in these embroideries. Writers from the late seventeenth and well into the eighteenth century remarked on the asymmetry that was prevalent in Chinese design and architecture, as opposed to the preference for symmetry and pleasing proportion in Western taste.⁵ These early chinoiserie embroideries embody the attempt to capture the beautiful disorder"" that Europeans found so irresistible.

It is thought that samplers containing whitework, cutwork, drawnwork, and lace designs were stitched only after multi-colored band samplers were finished, as whitework techniques are more difficult. However, this theory is based on a the very small number of documented seventeenth-century embroiderers who made multiple samplers.

It is divided into two parts—""matters Civil"" and ""matters Sacred""—and includes additional material gathered from his supporters about events surrounding his death. It constitutes an expanded edition of an earlier compilation, the Eikon Basilike [Image of the King]: The Poutraicture of His Sacred Maiestie in His Solitudes and Sufferings, a 1649 printing of which is bound into the second part of the volume. The Eikon Basilike purported to be a collection of the writings of Charles I that presented the major events of his life and reign from his own point of view in language that was simple, direct, and, for a monarch, unprecedentedly personal. This narrative was interspersed with the king’s favorite prayers and psalms in a style that directly echoed the Penitential Psalms of King David and thereby offered both a justification of his rule and a kind of spiritual autobiography.The Eikon Basilike was first published by Richard Royston, who was the leading Royalist publisher in London throughout the Civil War period and who was imprisoned in 1645 for issuing ""scandalous books and papers"" against the Parliament and thereafter in constant danger of further harassment at the hands of the Council of State. By his own account, Royston received orders directly from the king in October 1648 to prepare his printing press; on December 23 he was given the manuscript through an Edward Simmons, as from the king, and had it printed. Charles’s authorship has been contested from its first appearance to the present day, although it is now widely agreed (as the Royalist apologists had insisted) that the core of the book was Charles’s but that the materials were shaped into their final form by his chaplain, the Presbyterian divine John Gauden, later bishop of Exeter.From the beginning, the Eikon Basilike was a hugely popular best-seller and became the chief focus of national grief and guilt after the king’s death. The book was sold on the streets of London on January 30, 1649, the day of Charles’s execution, and went through thirty-five English editions that year. It became, in effect, a form of common property, hotly debated among Parliamentarian detractors and their Royalist opponents and prompting numerous rebuttals and counter-rebuttals, including John Milton’s furious rejoinder, Eikonoklastes, which appeared on October 6, 1649. As Elizabeth Wheeler emphasized, the Eikon Basilike had no single fixed appearance and from the first was subject to numerous additions of text and images. The work also appeared in a range of cheap to expensive editions and in different formats, from regular folio size to tiny miniature versions.The present copy of Reliquiae Sacrae Carolinae is one product of this process, although Frances Madan noted that all the additional materials within were vouched for by persons who were near the king and involved in the publication process of the original Eikon Basilike. It includes a miscellany of the king’s speeches to Parliament, his ""Messages for Peace,"" and, in the second part, a selection of his prayers, the text of the Eikon Basilike, his ""papers about Church Government,"" a list of the judges who officiated at Charles’s trial in a section headed ""Severall things relating to His Majesties Death, a list of London’s mayor and city aldermen, and various speeches and epitaphs by others made after the king’s death. According to Madan, this edition was published in London by Roger Norton with the false Hague imprint of Samuel Browne, suggesting that there was an inherent danger for Royston and his London printer, Roger Norton, in publishing such materials during these years.The embroidered cover of this volume has on the front the figure of a woman holding a cornucopia, probably representing Plenty; on the back is a woman holding a palm branch, presumably Peace. Plenty and Peace were likely qualities that the owner attached to monarchical rule. Embroidered references or borrowings from the Eikon Basilike include in the Victoria and Albert Museum collection an embroidered panel after the William Marshall engraving used as the frontispiece for the 1649 version of the Eikon Basilike (inv. no.

This graphic effect is particularly apparent in the brick stitch used as the ground in the border around the oval frame. It is unusual that the embroiderer has adopted the printmakers’ and painters’ convention of signing his work at the bottom of the image: ""R. Hayes Fecit."" This claim to professional status makes it likely that R. Hayes was indeed a professional embroiderer, and this is consistent with the evenness of stitching. It is most evident in the rendering of Charles’s flowing hair, where the embroiderer has articulated the graceful ringlets by twisting the silk floss at the tips of the gathered curl to create a play of light that closely approaches the nature of human hair.The embroidery is derived from a popular image of Charles I, which was made after his execution and exists in at least two prints: an engraving by Edward Bower, published by Robert Preeke in 1649, and an etching produced by Wenceslaus Hollar in the same year (MMA, 17.50.85). Although Yvonne Hackenbroch suggests the former as the direct print source for this embroidery, it is in fact closer to the Hollar version, in the exact transcription of the pose, in the king’s size and position relative to the oval surround, and in such details as the gloved hand and the cloak embroidered with the emblem of the Order of the Garter. John Peacock has posited that the Hollar portrait drew upon the painted portrait of Charles I Wearing the Garter Star of about 1632 by Anthony van Dyck and an ""idiosyncratic"" etching of Charles I by George Lid, published as a frontispiece of A Continuation of Lucan of 1630. From the former, he derived the general disposition of pose and details of costume, including the emblazoned Garter Star, and from the latter, the idea of showing the king wearing a broad-brimmed hat. That Charles wears the hat in several posthumous prints and in the embroidered portrait is a probable reference to his attire in court, when, as Hackenbroch pointed out, ""Charles declined to take his hat off during the trials lest this gesture be interpreted as a sign of respect towards his Judges."" In the embroidered portrait, this reference, combined with an aureole of light emanating from behind him, confers upon the image of the king both the specificity of an historical memory and an iconic aura appropriate to its commemorative function.[Jonathan Tavares, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",Embroidery

The 1601 inventory of Bess of Hardwick, Countess of Shrewsbury (1527-1608), included two quilts that were almost certainly products of this trade: “a quilt of yellow India stuff embroidered with birds and beasts” and “a quilt of India stuff embroidered with beastes.""¹ Indian quilts of the type produced for the Portuguese market appeared with increasing frequency in London sales into the 1620s, when their value began to decline, perhaps because of diminishing novelty.²The taste for Indian-style embroidery remained, however, and it is interesting to note that the English maker of this textile used not only the Indian palette of golden yellow on white but also an imported Indian cotton as the foundation. The cover has rare seventeenth-century marks on the plain-weave cotton fabric: the initials G.C.E. (for the English East India Company's original name, The Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies) as well as three other stamps whose significance has not yet been deciphered.³ On this bedcover, the embroidered designs draw heavily on such exotic motifs as pineapple-like vegetation and serrated leaves, but contemporary European sensibilities are also evident in the strapwork connecting the floral elements. Additionally, the three-dimensionality of the embroidery and the use of stitches with long floats that create a shinier surface to contrast with the matte appearance of the cotton ground diverge from the Indian prototypes, whose flatter chain stitches are less glossy. English bedcovers were usually part of coordinated sets that could include bolsters, pillows, and matching valances⁴In addition to the more common monochrome yellow-on white embroideries, Indian polychrome embroideries also arrived in England during the early seventeenth century. They, too, are described in sale records; for example, a 1614 sale included “a carpet or quilt embroidered upon calico with sundry silks.""⁵  The word “carpet” is probably used in its contemporaneous sense, that is, to signify decorative covers for a variety of furniture types, including beds. MMA 1970.173, an English polychrome silk and metal-thread bedcover, is more obviously dependent on the stylistic composition of Persian and Turkish carpets than this textile. By the eighteenth century, both embroidered and painted cotton textiles of this type, with a central medallion and smaller medallions in the corners of the central field, were being made in India for domestic consumption and for export.⁶  These imported polychrome covers had a lasting influence on the production of English embroidered bed furnishings of the eighteenth century.

Unlike other gloves of the time, which have separately constructed and highly decorated gauntlets that appear far too fragile to wear, this pair would have been relatively functional.These gloves were said to have belonged to James I, primarily because of the presence of the Scottish thistle in the embroidery, but there is no conclusive evidence of this connection. This attribution was first asserted by W. B. Redfern in 1904 and repeated by Frances Morris in 1929. As an insignia of royalty after James’s accession to the English throne, the thistle motif was usually combined with the Tudor rose to represent the union of England and Scotland under one ruler, as on an early seventeenth-century embroidered cushion cover with the royal arms surmounted by a large rose and two small stylized thistles, now held in the Victoria and Albert Museum.Beginning in the late sixteenth century, gloves play an increasingly visible role in portraiture, and their functions were practical as well as symbolic. This pair may be similar to the type of leather glove with metallic thread fringe described in the wardrobes of both sons of James I, as described in surviving inventories and bills for both princes’ wardrobes. Accounts from about 1608 for Henry, Prince of Wales, included ""four pair of staggs leather gloves, perfumed and fringed with gold and silver fringe, at 16s.""

Charles I is also depicted wearing a similar pair of gloves of gray-brown leather with embroidered gauntlets and metallic thread fringe in Daniel Mytens’s 1629 portrait of the king (MMA, 06.1289).[Melinda Watt, adapted from English Embroidery from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1580-1700: 'Twixt Art and Nature / Andrew Morrall and Melinda Watt ; New Haven ; London : Published for The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, Design, and Culture, New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York [by] Yale University Press, 2008.]",Embroidery

A specialty was polychrome-velvet weaving, as in this fabric, which possibly was intended to be used for an elegant wide-skirted mantua, or gown. Although the pattern repeat of stylized and seminaturalistic flowers is relatively small, it appears more complex, as it is rendered with seven different colors, a feat of technical virtuosity. The individual motifs are further modeled by juxtaposing cut and uncut (""ciselé"") pile, which reflect light differently. This mutable effect is more dramatic when the fabric is in movement, as one's perception of the colors changes dramatically depending on whether the fabric is vertical or horizontal, flat or draped.",Velvet

The poem, published in Parma in 1581, is based on an earlier orally-transmitted retelling of the story of the capture of Jerusalem during the First Crusade of 1099.

The history of the set is a mystery.  It was purchased in Naples in 1868, but the documentation provided by Mr May, the Museum's Art Referee, to justify the acquisition is scant.  Clearly the hangings have been cut down as portions of the scenes they depict are missing, but we have no information about the original size of the embroideries or the extent of the set.  Nor do we know by or for whom they were made.

Some of the embroideries have complex borders incorporating caryatid figures and festoons of flowers with a central cartouche quoting the relevant passage from Tasso.  These borders are very similar in design to those of a set of tapestries also depicting scenes from <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> made for the Cardinal-Nephew, Pietro Ottoboni (1667-1740), by the San Michele manufactory in Rome.  Four of these tapestries are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.  The tapestries were based upon painted wall hangings commissioned by Ottoboni for his apartments in the Papal Palace in 1691.  An inventory of about 1740 indicates that there were seventeen tapestries in the series.  As the tapestries were made in the 1730s, and these hangings predate them it is tempting to speculate that these embroideries are also based upon the painted hangings designed for Ottoboni.  Even if this is not the case it is likely that the tapestries, embroideries and paintings derive from a single printed source.  Further research is necessary to illuminate these extraordinary works of art.",Embroidery

Bed valances
1580–1600

Sets of bed hangings created an enclosed, private space within the bedrooms of palaces and grand houses. They were a focal point for luxurious decoration. The horizontal form of valances suited narratives that continued around the bed. These four valances show scenes of courtly life and stories from classical literature.

BED VALANCES
1580-1600

Valances were borders around the top of an Elizabethan bed. Their horizontal form created a frieze for narratives that were embroidered or woven. This pair shows two scenes from the myth of Adonis. One features his conception, resulting from the incestuous affair between Myrrah and Cinyras. The other shows his death while hunting.

The turban was a popular form of fashionable headdress from the 1790s until 1820s. Inspired by interest in the classical world and exotic ideas of the East, the form and style of fashionable turban changed frequently. This tartan turban, with its emphasised front and velvet banding is typical of styles of the mid-1820s.

Traditional Scottish dress and tartan in particular, had been popularised in the late eighteenth century by the Prince of Wales, later George IV.

Suitably lavish textiles for domestic goods could be hard to come by. These hangings incorporate both British and Indian cottons. The import of decorated cottons from India was illegal at this time, but this did nothing to stem the demand. Both men and women negotiated directly with smugglers to acquire them. 
According to a diary kept by the donor's ancestor, these hangings were made on the Bedford School Estate in London, a large housing estate that funded a charitable school for underprivileged children. Over 6,400 pieces have been stitched together.

To maintain a fire all day demands a certain level of skill - knowing when to add more fuel, when to poke the fire and when to leave it alone - and a range of specialist tools.  Bellows like these were designed to add oxygen to a smouldering fire, encouraging it to burn more fiercely.

The opulent decoration of these bellows is achieved using boulle marquetry, named after its most famous proponent, André Charles Boulle (1642–1732), cabinet-maker to Louis XIV of France, although these bellows were almost certainly made in France between 1860 and 1880. The technique of boulle involves cutting patterns out of a sandwich of layers of brass or pewter and layers of turtle shell, to create both a dark motif with a light background and a light motif with a dark background. The contrast created by using metal and turtle shell is heightened by staining the shell or, as in this case, backing it with a coloured foil (here red). Detail was added to both the metal and the turtle shell by engraving, which was often filled with black or white mastic (though this has rarely survived centuries of wear and polish). These bellows have the same design on both sides, but while the front has a tortoiseshell background with brass motifs, the back has a brass background with tortoiseshell motifs.",Velvet

http://data.silknow.org/object/9eba9cd4-3597-361c-92b8-1d93e6f87577,vam,"Chair from a set of at least 6, of mahogany, with upholstered seat, the frame with cabriole front legs on ball and claw feet, the back 1750-70, the back carved with the crest of Eyre (an armoured leg).
<u>Design</u>
The cabriole legs have ball feet, each gripped by four bird’s claws, which, unusually, are pierced through at the lower end. The lower part of the leg is plain, rounded, with, above, a section carved with feathers (looking in places more like leaves), the top edges meeting the seat rail with additional, scrolled spandrel brackets. A lappet is apparently laid over the feathers, the edges moulded and scrolled into the ears of the cabriole leg with the outer edges carved as ‘reversed gadrooning’. The lower scroll of these meets an acanthus pendant, carved down the front of the leg. Below this, carved swags of fabric hang from a carved ring and appear to be looped back and knotted at the back of the leg, with carved tassels hanging down, all this forming the lower edge of the feathered section. On the knee, a scallop shell is carved over crossed palms. 
The back legs, which are continuous with the uprights and square sectioned with a curving rake, are cut on the front face cut with a decided kick. The inner edges are chamfered. 
The back is rectangular with a pierced central splat. The uprights taper upwards with an ‘S’ curve just below the junction with the cresting rail. The front faces have a moulding on the outer edge and are angled back towards the splat. This faces are carved with a foliated scroll at the base and a symmetrical device of scrolls flanking a shell.
The cresting rail is serpentine with outer corner extensions, heavily scrolled back in a tight paper-like scroll. The front faces of these are carved with acanthus and a small floral drop. The centre section of the rail is raised and is likewise heavily scrolled, the front carved with a scallop shell with crossed palms below. 
The outer side section curves of the centre of the crest rail continue down, scrolling into the pierced splat, which is composed of two opposed elongated scrolls, enclosing a circle. This which contains a carved crest showing an armoured leg with spur on a torque (the crest of Eyre). Below this is a further pair of scrolls with a leafy pendant, which touches the base rail of the splat, carved with two half rounds, one each side of the leaf. The shoe, into which the splat is fitted, is of standard pattern with a moulded top edge.

<u>Construction, seat and condition:</u>
Mortise and tenon construction, the uprights and back legs continuous. The seat rails are tenoned into the back uprights and double pegged and tenoned into blocks above the front legs. The uprights are tenoned up into the top rail, the splat also tenoned up into this and down into the back seat rail. The shoe sits on top of the back rail and sits around the front three faces of the base of the splat, and the splat is pinned forwards into the shoe. The back seat rail is set with a single piece of mahogany veneer. This is broken away in places and may be a replacement.
The seat is upholstered in green silk velvet, now much faded and worn. Underneath a finejute base cloth is visible. The webbing is black and white chevron, 4.8 cm wide with 3 chevrons, with 3 widths back to front and 3 set laterally. All of these have broken through and loose horsehair is visible above. 
The seat  has rails of oak with softwood blocks attached with large handmade nails, these all late additions. The shaped spandrel block inside the proper right back leg is a replacement and the other back block is missing. There is evidence of old nails on the top inner surface of the seat rails. The spandrel blocks on the sides are lighter in colour and may be replacements.  The shaped corner block inside the back legs are late additions. 

<u>Damage</u>:
There is a fracture at the base of the splat. The front spandrel of the proper left front leg is missing.  The end of a claw on the front proper right foot and small section of claw on PL are missing.",Velvet

John Heathcote's bobbinet machine, patented in 1809, enabled fine net to be easily produced in wide widths for dresses, which could be hand-embroidered to achieve individual and attractive effects. Net dresses were worn with underdresses of plain silk, sometimes white, or in a matching colour.

Chenille (French for caterpillar) is a type of thick thread made by a weaving process. Cotton or silk is woven into a length of cloth which is then cut into very narrow strips, the severed weft threads creating the tufts which give the yarn its velvety texture. The dense colour of chenille thread creates a contrasting effect with the ground fabric.

Fashion leaders such as Empress Josephine, Napoleon's first wife, helped to popularise dresses of machine net, or 'tulle', which was also produced in France. She owned many machine-made net dresses embroidered with silver or gold metal thread and spangles for formal court occasions.",Embroidery

Embroidered caskets were made in the 17th century and used by girls from well-off families to store personal possessions. They often have secret drawers built into them, allowing girls to hide their keepsakes. Due to the cost of the materials, and the significant amount of time required to make an embroidered casket, they became prized possessions. As a result a significant number have survived in good condition. 

<b>Materials & Making</b>
The panels for embroidered caskets were generally worked by young girls, around aged 11, as part of their education. Young girls in the 17th century would be taught needlework skills from a young age, starting with creating a sampler, then moving on the whitework and cutwork, and then finally creating a casket. The panels would then be sent off to be made up into a casket.",Satin (fabric)

Jackal hunting was popular among British soldiers and administrators living in India during the nineteenth century. The rules were based on the British fox hunt although the hunting packs tended to be made up of dogs of different breeds known as ‘Bobbery-Packs’ in Anglo-Indian colloquial terms, and hence the name ‘Bobbery Hunt’.

This light linen coat would have proved ideal for hot climates, replacing the heavy woollen cloth used for British hunts. It was probably worn by the huntsman who looked after the dogs, as the slanting pocket on the front could have held a hunting whistle or horn. The collar is very similar to one worn by the Earl of Darlington for a Yorkshire hunt in 1826: ‘Lady Arabella was attired in her scarlet habit, and his Lordship in a straight-cut scarlet coat, with an embroidered fox on the collar, a hat, and a leather girdle across his shoulder. His two whippers-in were also in hats, and had the embroidered fox on the collar.’",Velvet

It functioned both as a sunshade and a fashionable accompaniment to dress, distinguishing itself from the umbrella through its infinite and luxurious forms and essentially feminine status. Like the earlier trend for fans parasols displayed an individual's style and could be used in a coquettish ritual to hide the modest bearer from unwanted glances

Small parasols such as this example were designed for open carriage rides which were hugely popular in the middle of the nineteenth century. A folding hinge, held upright by a sliding metal tube when open, meant the parasol could be reduced to half its size when not in use. Carriage parasols were often elaborate in design as their small size meant manufacturers could display their very best in labour and materials. They were also key in the display of wealth and taste, the very possession of one implying ownership of a carriage. This is a typical example of the 1850s, with a thin carved ivory stick and embroidered cover which had become common place, The Ladies Cabinet reporting in 1850 'There is a profusion of embroideries on all materials this year.'",Embroidery

These are expensive, well-woven panels made of the natural, undyed cotton known as Gossypium Mexicanum and decorated with a great number of different types of thread.  They were woven on a backstrap loom and therefore have four selvedges each; in contrast to the red tzute displayed on the left (T.35-1931), the area of loosely packed weft is difficult to discern, it is about 1"" from the lower edge.

The panel on the left (T.33-1931) is the most complex textile in the Maudslay Bequest: eleven different types of thread have been used to decorate it: red, yellow, light green and dark blue cotton, a little red wool, yellow floss silk (faded to cream), light blue, light purple, black and white floss silk and a tightly and regularly spun purple cotton (S3Z) which was undoubtedly machine-spun.  Dye analysis has shown that the red cotton was dyed with Alizarin and the purple silk with cochineal.  The machine-spun purple cotton was dyed with purpura patula, an expensive dye obtained from a shell-fish.  Cohcineal had been used to dye the purple silk in this piece and in the headcloth displayed in the case opposite (T.31-1931), but cochineal would not take on cotton and so the expensive purpura patula has been used.

Only eight different types of thread were used in the panel on the right (T.34-1931), the following ones are not found: red wool, light blue floss silk and black floss silk. []",Brocaded

The black ground has a large flattened eight-pointed star in red, with a central beige quatrefoil shape (possibly representing a pool of water) within which are four floral motifs which may be flowers growing from a central island.  Around the 'pool' are four yellow stylised trees and four U-shapes which are filled with geometric motifs. In each corner of the cover is a stylised red palmette flanked by white leaf forms; these alternate with a large U-shaped motif in beige and with other scattered motifs. It is possible that this design represents a version of a Persian Garden Carpet. A narrow yellow border has a thin black angular meander carrying blue, red, yellow and green leaf forms.

Mughal
Late 18th century
Anonymous loan

An angarkha (from a Sanskrit term meaning ‘body protector’) is a type of robe characterised by an insert panel over the chest. This young man’s angarkha is embroidered with a style of floral motif popular during the late Mughal era. Its floor-length skirt dates it to the late 18th century, when the fashion was for much longer robes than the knee-length of earlier decades. [01/08/2017]

Reticules, or 'indispensibles', were used in the early 19th century to carry such necessities for a woman as her purse, smelling salts and handkerchief.

http://data.silknow.org/object/b918334a-5262-3daf-841e-bd2f0fff86bc,vam,"The interest in this chair lies not just in its fashionable Rococo appearance, but in its later use as a prop by the artist Richard Cosway (1742-1821).  It was probably made in the 1750s, when such chairs were the height of fashion.  Cosway probably bought the chair second-hand in about 1770. He used the chair in several paintings. 

The chair was used as a prop for the painting 'Charles Townley with a group of connoisseurs', 1771-1775, now in Towneley Hall Art Gallery and Museums, Burnely.

A sitter in another Cosway portrait showing the chair is Elizabeth - or Eliza - Draper (1744-1778), best known for her friendship with the British author Laurence Sterne (1713-1768). Mrs Draper lived in India for most of her life, and met Sterne in 1767, when she was visiting England. Sterne mentioned Mrs Draper in ‘A Sentimental Journey through France and Italy’ published in 1768.  He also wrote a ‘Journal to Eliza’ which was published long after his death.  Mrs Draper again visited England in the mid-1770s, when Cosway painted her sitting in this chair. 

The chair has been covered in modern silk damask (2001), copying the upholstery which is visible in Draper portrait. The stuffing gives rounded profiles to the seat, back and arms.

A pencil drawing in the V&amp;A collection (Museum no.2848:149) by Matthias Lock (ca. 1710-1765) appears to be the design for this chair. Lock, as well as designing and making his own furniture, also supplied some of the furniture designs for Thomas Chippendale's book ‘The Gentleman and Cabinet-Maker's Director’, published in 1754.",Damask

It was expensive because it made use of expensive raw materials (silk and gold), was time-consuming to weave, and required skilled labour. Production was organised in a guild system.

The main centres of silk weaving in fourteenth and fifteenth century Europe were in Italian cities - Venice, Milan, Lucca, Florence, Genoa, Bologna, although some Spanish centres in eastern and southern Spain attempted to compete. Valencia, for example, imported Genoese weavers at the end of the fifteenth century to set up a guild of velvet weavers (<i>Art de Velluters</i> and the Cofradía de San Jerónimo (1479-83)).

An epitaphios is a large cloth carried in procession in the Good Friday services and for which the early term was Great Aër. The decoration, with the body of the dead Christ accompanied by angels with fans and with the symbols or figures of the evangelists in the corners, is of conventional form. In this example, the verses from the troparion emphasise the Good Friday theme. The dedication also mentions <i>Prayer of the servant of God Nicholas Eudaimonoioannes with his wife and children in the year 6915</i><i> <I>[<i>1407</i>]</I>.</i> The Nicholas mentioned here may well be the Nicholas Eudaimonoioannes who acted as Manuel II's ambassador to the Venetians in 1416 and was one of his delegates to the Council of Constantine in 1414-17. 

The Eudaimonoioannes family held an important place in the history of the Morea (the Peloponnese), as archons of Monemvasia from the 13th century until the Turkish conquest. The epitaphios was probably commissioned for donation to a church in Nicholas' native Morea.

It depicts the Last Supper, the gathering of Christ and his 12 disciples described in the New Testament. The embroidery dates from the period when William Laud was Archbishop of Canterbury. Laud laid great emphasis on the restoration of beauty and dignity to church decoration and worship. In the 1630s many entries in churchwardens’ accounts refer to the refurbishment of altars and pulpits and the provision of rich textiles for church furnishings. 

The embroidery is likely to have been commissioned by Henry 5th Baron Sandys of the Vyne, in Hampshire, and is associated with an altar frontal also in the Museum's collection, T.108-1963, with the Sandys arms and dated 1633. The exceptional quality and technique of the embroidery suggest that it was worked by Edmund Harrison, the King’s Embroiderer, and can be compared with the smaller picture of the Nativity in the V&A’s collection T.147-1930 signed by him. The print source for the dossal has been identified as an engraving of The Last Supper circa 1590, by Hieronymous Wierix (c.1553-1619) after Otto van Veen (1556-1629).",Velvet

http://data.silknow.org/object/235fe241-e411-313b-ab6d-363646d522d4,vam,"This is one of a set of five embroidered wall hangings depicting scenes from Torquato Tasso's epic poem <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> or Jerusalem Delivered.  The poem, published in Parma in 1581, is based on an earlier orally-transmitted retelling of the story of the capture of Jerusalem during the First Crusade of 1099.

The history of the set is a mystery.  It was purchased in Naples in 1868, but the documentation provided by Mr May, the Museum's Art Referee, to justify the acquisition is scant.  Clearly the hangings have been cut down as portions of the scenes they depict are missing, but we have no information about the original size of the embroideries or the extent of the set.  Nor do we know by or for whom they were made.

Some of the embroideries have complex borders incorporating caryatid figures and festoons of flowers with a central cartouche quoting the relevant passage from Tasso.  These borders are very similar in design to those of a set of tapestries also depicting scenes from <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> made for the Cardinal-Nephew, Pietro Ottoboni (1667-1740), by the San Michele manufactory in Rome.  Four of these tapestries are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.  The tapestries were based upon painted wall hangings commissioned by Ottoboni for his apartments in the Papal Palace in 1691.  An inventory of about 1740 indicates that there were seventeen tapestries in the series.  As the tapestries were made in the 1730s, and these hangings predate them it is tempting to speculate that these embroideries are also based upon the painted hangings designed for Ottoboni.  Even if this is not the case it is likely that the tapestries, embroideries and paintings derive from a single printed source.  Further research is necessary to illuminate these extraordinary works of art.",Embroidery

Francesco Sforza (1401-66) adopted it as his heraldic device along with the motto <i>Mit Zeit</i> (with time). He may have been referring to his endurance and perseverance in obtaining his political position. During his reign (1450-66) the plant was represented only by the large central flower, isolated from stems and leaves and repeated across the width of the fabric three times. The motif evolved over the following twenty years into a more naturalistic version, such as is seen on this velvet.

This pattern on an even richer, gold brocaded velvet is represented on the stomacher and sleeve of a gown worn by Bianca Maria Sforza in a potrait by De Predis. This portrait was made to commemorate her marriage to Maximilian of Austria in 1493. In this context, the pattern probably referred directly to the dynasty from which she came.",Velvet

Riding habits were one of the few women’s garments available in a tailored style. Gradually demand grew for stylish, practical and hard-wearing outfits suitable for a wide range of outdoor activities including shopping, travelling and walking. By the 1870s the tailored look for women had really begun to take hold. Cutting systems used on men’s suits were transferred to fashionable skirts and bodices and the resulting styles were rapidly adopted. Fashion magazines and cutting journals trumpeted the superior skill of the tailor whose methods of manipulating cloth captured the full beauty of the female form.

This bodice shows how the tailor has modified his techniques to suit the fashionable silhouette. With special attention to measuring, cutting and making he has moulded the cloth to follow the curves of the bust, hollow of the waist and the prominence of the hips.  The outer cloth was fitted to the figure with the aid of a canvas interlining constructed with darts and seams to give the required contours. Both were skilfully pressed into shape using a variety of irons and a damp rag which was necessary to produce steam.  The rich colour and luxurious velvet decoration heightens the jacket's feminine appeal which is capped by full sleeves in true 1890s style.",Velvet

It is said to have been worn by Cara Leland Huttleston Rogers of New York, later Lady Fairhaven. 

The bodice is waist length, panelled with satin and edged with black moiré ribbon.  It is trimmed at the back with a made-up bow with long pendant ends.  The dress fastens at the shoulder over a boned, green silk bodice lining.  The sleeves are long with a high pleated shoulder.  Collar and cuffs are faced with gold beaded tulle.  The skirt has a slightly draped front, with the back flared and arranged in deep pleats.  It is mounted over a green silk petticoat, and boned and taped to a bustle shape at the back.  The skirt may have been altered and have lost a side panel.  

A machine-woven label 'Worth Paris' has been stitched to the waist tape. Charles Frederick Worth (1825-95) was a celebrated Parisian couture dressmaker.  He was born in 1825 in Bourne, Lincolnshire, and started working at the age of 12 in a draper's shop in London. Eight years later he moved to Paris, where he opened his own premises in 1858.

The remainder of the chapel fittings are also enumerated, from a description given by  the steward to the Mottisfont Estate, Thomas King. They consisted of an altar frontal embroidered with the Last Supper, some pieces of purple velvet with the initials IHS, a desk hanging of purple velvet embroidered in gold and silver with the arms of Sandys, two book covers and a folding cushion with the letters 'THS' on the outside and the arms of Sandys on the inside.

Damask-weaving evolved in China, and was imported into Europe, where Italian silk weavers adopted the technique, sometimes incorporating Eastern design elements into their own textiles. Often these textiles were made of silk.

The majority of Italian 14th-century silk designs fall into the category of ""pomegranate patterns"" – a description coined in the nineteenth century. They are seen most frequently in the period between 1420 and 1550, and vary in composition and form. Often, the ""pomegranate"" resembles more closely a pine cone, a thistle, a lotus flower, or a pineapple.  In this example, the pomegranate design is not dominant, yet is still present, the main element of the pattern being a multi-foil shape containing a clump of flowers. 

This textile was bought in the nineteenth century from a church in Germany. It had  probably been used for ecclesiastical purposes. Portraits from the period show, however, that similar designs could also be used for secular, fashionable dress.",Damask

It was worn by Mrs Granville Alexander, a daughter of the U.S. sewing machine pioneer, Isaac Singer. The donor was her great-niece.

The bodice is seamed and gored for a moulded fit. It extends into drapes at the hips and merges with the train, which falls in inverted pleats from the seams of the bodice. The inside of the skirt is hooped at the back, with tapes for adjustment, to create the bustle effect.  The elegant cut, combined with the rich materials and embroidery, makes for a flattering silhouette. 

Worth was a celebrated Parisian couture dressmaker. He was born in 1825 in Bourne, Lincolnshire, and started working at the age of 12 in a draper's shop in London. Eight years later he moved to Paris, where he opened his own premises in 1858. He was soon patronised by the Empress Eugenie and her influence was instrumental to his success.

This embroidered panel would have belonged to a set of three valances, their purpose to adorn the head of a bed, obscuring the pole and rungs of the bed curtains. Embroidered with brightly coloured wools and silks, valances provided a means of decorative insulation from the draughts, cold and humidity that plagued sixteenth-century houses. 

Beds and their textiles figure prominently in inventories of effects from the Renaissance, an indication of how greatly they were valued. Those individuals who were of high rank, conveyed their position to their contemporaries through conspicuous consumption, with a lavish display of costly textiles.

<i>Embroidery</i> 
The valance is embroidered entirely in petit-point, the French name for tent stitch (also known as half stitch), which enjoyed a period of great popularity in the last few decades of the sixteenth century. Despite being a relatively simple stitch, which enabled the embroiderer to cover large areas of ground comparatively quickly, petit-point nevertheless aspired to the same elevated status as tapestry and was distinguished from other stitches by its classification as needlework tapestry (<i>la tapisserie à l'aiguille</i>). By virtue of its simplicity, petit point was practised by amateur and professional embroiderer alike. The stitch lent itself well to naturalistic motifs and bold, albeit somewhat geometric compositions. This valance would most likely have been worked by a woman of noble birth; embroidery was held to be an essential skill for any accomplished woman of aristocratic rank. However, due to the size and complexity of the composition, the possiblility remains that it may have been executed by a professional embroiderer, who may have been employed as part of the household. 

<i>Subject</i> 
The Garden of Love, identifiable here by the prominent fountain of Cupid, shown with his quiver, raising a single arrow in the air, was a common parable in the Renaissance ornamental repertoire, characterised by its idyllic landscape and the languid couples who people it. The garden served not just as a suitable and decorative site for courtship, but as a visual metaphor for love itself. This was a device frequently employed in the decoration of Italian furniture, most commonly employed for objects commissioned as wedding gifts. Thus, allegorical depictions of love on valances such as this one, reinforced to the viewer both the role and status of the bed and the part it played in the conjugal relations that were pivotal to the continuation of a family's lineage. The enduring theme of love vanquishing aggression, as depicted on this valance, was a subject entirely suitable to the the context of the bedroom.

http://data.silknow.org/object/1b273e82-8fe2-3058-9379-b60c68f41201,vam,"This is one of a set of five embroidered wall hangings depicting scenes from Torquato Tasso's epic poem <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> or Jerusalem Delivered.  The poem, published in Parma in 1581, is based on an earlier orally-transmitted retelling of the story of the capture of Jerusalem during the First Crusade of 1099.

The history of the set is a mystery.  It was purchased in Naples in 1868, but the documentation provided by Mr May, the Museum's Art Referee, to justify the acquisition is scant.  Clearly the hangings have been cut down as portions of the scenes they depict are missing, but we have no information about the original size of the embroideries or the extent of the set.  Nor do we know by or for whom they were made.

Some of the embroideries have complex borders incorporating caryatid figures and festoons of flowers with a central cartouche quoting the relevant passage from Tasso.  These borders are very similar in design to those of a set of tapestries also depicting scenes from <i>Gerusalemme Liberata</i> made for the Cardinal-Nephew, Pietro Ottoboni (1667-1740), by the San Michele manufactory in Rome.  Four of these tapestries are now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.  The tapestries were based upon painted wall hangings commissioned by Ottoboni for his apartments in the Papal Palace in 1691.  An inventory of about 1740 indicates that there were seventeen tapestries in the series.  As the tapestries were made in the 1730s, and these hangings predate them it is tempting to speculate that these embroideries are also based upon the painted hangings designed for Ottoboni.  Even if this is not the case it is likely that the tapestries, embroideries and paintings derive from a single printed source.  Further research is necessary to illuminate these extraordinary works of art.",Embroidery

Their purpose was to provide the inexperienced needlewoman with a practical guide for stitches and motifs while giving her the opportunity to practise them.  Once completed on a long strip of linen the sampler would be rolled up and kept for future reference.

However, during the eighteenth century this practical exercise was combined with another purpose.  As the shape of the sampler changed from a strip to a rectangle so its form changed from what was essentially a practise sheet to a carefully planned pictorial composition arranged symmetrically within a border.  By the time this example was stitched in 1810 this was the standard format.  It was also common to include quotations from religious or literary sources, usually with a moralising overtone.  Some of the subjects depicted in this sampler, such as the stags and insects, can be found in other samplers elsewhere and may have been derived from a common published source or teacher.",Embroidery

Caskets were made and used by girls in the 17th century. The girls would decorate small panels with embroidery which would then be sent to a cabinet-maker to be made up into a casket. They were often fitted with compartments for sewing and writing as well as a small mirror. Many cabinets also had secret compartments, used to store personal possessions such as jewellery or letters. The high cost of the materials, as well as the skill needed to create these caskets, means they could only have been made in wealthy households.

<b>People</b>
The panels were worked by young girls, aged around 11 or 12, as part of their education. Girls started learning needlework skills aged 6 or 7, first creating a band sampler (see T.433-1990) and then moving on to more complex pieces such as cutwork. Embroidering the panels of a casket or for a mirror (see T.17-1955) appears to have been one of the last stage of a girl’s needlework education. These skills would be useful later in life in the management of a household.

<b>Materials &amp; Designs</b>
Biblical, mythological and classical scenes were all popular themes for decorating caskets. While some girls may have designs their own panels, taking inspiration from sources such as illustrated bibles, it also appears to have been possible to have purchased designs, which the embroiderer could then customise by using certain colours or adding in features. This casket is the largest in the V&A's collection.",Satin (fabric)

As the print was published in black and white,  the embroiderer was free to choose her colours and stitches, and so demonstrate both her taste and skill. The picture may have been part of a decorative scheme (perhaps including other designs by Kauffmann) on walls, furniture or porcelain. Her designs had more widespread and diverse uses than those of any other decorative painter of the period.<br><br><b>Materials and Making</b><br>This style of embroidered picture was almost always worked in coloured silks on a white satin ground, with the design, taken from an engraving, sketched onto the background.

Until the later 17th century most silks were imported. But a silk-weaving industry developed in England, centred around Spitalfields in London, which grew increasingly successful between 1700 and 1760. Huguenot refugee families, contributing technical and business skills, played an integral part in its development.

Spitalfields weavers produced plain and patterned fabrics. Designs changed season by season, influenced by French fashions but developing a distinctive English style. 

This fabric, woven in Spitalfields, is a brocaded silk satin, and was intended for ladies' gowns. The technique of brocading allowed different colours to be introduced into the pattern of a fabric in specific, sometimes very small areas. It was a more laborious process for the weaver than using patterning wefts running from selvedge to selvedge, but the resulting effect could be much more varied and lively.",Satin (fabric)

Its plain design was part of the movement in fashion away from what were considered by some to be the extravagant excesses of the late eighteenth century.  The move was towards a simpler, purer style of dress and footwear that was influenced by designs from classical antiquity. 

Slippers or 'sandle shoes', continued to be worn well into the mid-century although by the 1850s they were used mainly for formal wear in black or white.  This pair of shoes is a typical example of that style.  The thin leather sole and delicately hand-stitched satin uppers were relatively simple and cheap to produce.  They could then be customised either by the retailer or the owner with rosettes, ribbon ankle ties or other decorative embellishments.",Satin (fabric)

Houghton  was built between 1722 and 1735 for Sir Robert Walpole, England's first prime minister. This suite furnished the second state apartment, which was initially planned as a large bedroom and smaller dressing room; but before the apartment was finished the dressing room became the bedroom, and the bedroom was turned into a cabinet of paintings. The bedroom houses a bed with colourful embroidered hangings, which appears to have been made around 1715-20 for an earlier house at Houghton. The green velvet chairs were probably made in the late 1720s, in a slightly old-fashioned style to suit the bed. The use of burr-walnut veneer (cut from the root parts of the tree), with carved and gilt gesso ornament, is a mark of the very highest-quality chair-making of the period.

In 1882 he left the collection to the South Kensington Museum, the forerunner of the V&A. Jones was taken in by some 19th-century fakes, but it is unlikely that he was taken in by these.

These two pieces of silk embroidery on linen represent a pair of unfinished pockets. They show that the embroidery was done first, before cutting out and sewing up. The lack of space for an opening in the embroidery indicates that these were probably intended to be the backs of a pair of pockets. This is somewhat unusual, as most pocket backs were left plain.
The abstract squiggly pattern is called ‘vermicelli’, which is Italian for ‘little worms’. This design is also found on early 18th century bedcovers and quilts, particularly worked in yellow silk. The choice of colour imitates imported Indian embroideries, which preferred the natural yellow shade of tussar silk found in Bengal.

The design motif of bunches of grapes is composed of silver-gilt domed sequins and floss silk, while the heavy borders incorporate actual strips of flattened metal.  The weight of heavy, gold embroidered edgings attached to fine cotton or silk ground fabrics has often meant that fragile courtly garments like this woman's shirt had a short life and were then discarded.  It was common practice in the Indian subcontinent, however, to recycle costly and elaborate edgings on another garment, thereby prolonging their useful lives.  The pristine condition of this shirt suggests that it was never (or very rarely) worn, and it has been preserved in the collections of the Indian Museum and then the V & A since 1855.

The shirt would have been worn over a small bodice (<i>choli</i>) in the same material, and a large, matching veil (<i>odhni</i>) would have been added over the head and shoulders. The ensemble would be completed by a full skirt, which has not survived. The off-centre neck opening of this shirt is a style found in rural as well as courtly garments, especially in the north and west of the Indian subcontinent.",Embroidery

This specimen is thought to be the only known example of a complete and unaltered tester for a 16th century bed. It has a pattern in yellow satin, cut to shape and applied to the blue satin ground. The design consists of scaffolding of bandwork forming varied shaped compartments, with grimacing masks and human and half-human figures holding music sheets, musical instruments, leafy branches or baskets, or grappling with strange beasts and birds. The detail is embroidered in silk thread. The workmanship is of the highest professional quality and suggests a princely commission.

This bed-head was originally though to be Italian as the grotesque style started there. The term grotesque related to images found principally in Nero's Golden Palace in Rome when it was 'rediscovered' in the 16th century by Italian artists. 'Grotesque' was an adjective derived from 'grotto' and did not relate to the eerie nature of the images. The style became particularly favoured in France, from a comparatively early date, through the influence of Italian artists working in the French court. 

The design of the embroidery seen here is a French variation of the grotesque style, related, for example to the grotesque prints done from 1550 onwards, by Paris engravers Jacques Androuet du Cerceau and Etienne Delaune. Two small fragments of a French embroidered bed valance identical in style to this panel are in the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris and must be part of same bed ensemble.",Embroidery

The fronts curve from neck to hem, with pleats below the hip, beside the centre-back opening.  Each front has a pocket and pointed pocket flap.  The sleeves and pocket flaps are lined with white silk taffeta, the pockets with bleached linen.  The coat is embroidered to shape with silk floss in white, blue and shades of pink and green, in a pattern of flowers and elongated leaves with a net border, on the collar, cuffs and pocket flaps, around the pockets, along the front edges and hems, side pleats and centre-back opening.  There are 10 embroidered buttons on the right front edge, 3 below each pocket and 2 on each cuff (1 missing on right cuff).  The fronts fasten with a hook &amp; eye at mid-chest.

The waistcoat fronts and back are made of ivory silk woven in a chequered pattern, with a round neckline, curving fronts and skirts reaching to the top of the thigh.  The back and pockets are lined with bleached linen; the skirt and pocket flap linings and front facings are white silk taffeta.

There are 12 worked buttonholes along the left front and 12 corresponding embroidered buttons on the right front and 3 below each pocket. 

The breeches comprise 2 fronts, two backs and 2 waistbands of the purple silk velvet, uncut and voided in a chequered pattern.

The knee bands are embroidered with white, pink and green silk floss. 

The ensemble was altered in the 19th century, probably for theatre costume.  The pleats of the coat were rearranged and the fronts and back relined.  The waistcoat fronts were relined and the centre-back seam unpicked, the edges hemmed and 14 eyelets stitched on the right side of the back and 15 on the left side.

Above the waist, pleated bodices, wide necklines, balloon-like sleeves and intricate hairstyles were topped off with striking bonnets such as this example in the V&A's collection.

This hat is made from a base of straw plait, carefully stitched together to form the high crown and dramatic brim. The straw has been covered entirely with velvet and subsequently decorated with wide silk satin ribbons which have been carefully pinned into place. The ends of the ribbons have then been cut into a zigzag finish. 

Bonnet trimmings were constantly changed and updated in order to give a new look, and as such ribbons and trimmings are often pinned into place as opposed to being sewn, especially on a fabric such as velvet which would mark easily.

Until the mid-nineteenth century, black dye was often created from wood components and was notoriously unstable, often fading to a brown or purple shade. The velvet on this bonnet has faded softly to a dark brown but the ribbons retain their colour.  

The 'Merry Widow' cap designed by milliner Stephen Jones for his 'Albertopolis' collection, Autumn/Winter 2009 was directly inspired by this bonnet.",Velvet

As the fashion for wearing boots when out and about grew, it became practical to adopt a new type of comfortable shoe for use exclusively in the home.  Some women purchased patterns and embroidered slippers for themselves or their husbands.  

Here silk braids have been stitched to the black woollen 'upper' in the shape of flowers, leaves and scrolls.  The process of attaching one material to another in this way is called appliqué.  The pale blue silk edging and lining were probably chosen to correspond with the pale blue of some of the flowers.

Indeed, the agent of the Duke of Parma requested just such a silk with a nice green or blue ground from a Lyonnais manufacturer in the 1760s, appropriate for wearing to the theatre in Naples. Such silks probably cost between 36 and 180 livres per ell, at a time when a court dress required about 15 ells, and an unskilled labourer earned about 200 livres per year.

Women's gowns worn over wide hoops provided a large canvas which showed off the pattern, and which sparkled as its wearer moved in candlelight. Vestments in the Catholic Church and for the statues of saints and of the Virgin Mary might also use this kind of silk.

They are the work of Mary Queen of Scots, during her imprisonment in England and Elizabeth (Bess) Talbot, Countess of Shrewsbury.  Bess's husband George Talbot, Earl of Shrewsbury was responsible for Mary and she stayed at one or other of the Shrewsbury estates.   

Embroidery was a form of therapy and communication for Mary, as well as a conventional occupation for wealthy and elite women.  Most of the motifs depicted were copied from the wood-cut illustrations of emblem books and natural histories by well-known authors such as Claud Paradin, Conrad Gessner, Pierre Belon. These often represented sentiments and morals from classical literature and contemporary folklore, and were chosen by Mary to express her most private thoughts at a time when all her written correspondence was being monitored by her captors.

This work is known as the 'Marian' hanging, because the embroideries relate most directly to her.  It comprises individual panels of canvas work (stitching over the threads of a coarsely woven linen) in coloured silks, silver and silver-gilt thread, mounted on green velvet. The central panel bears the inscription VIRESCIT VULNERE VIRTUS (Virtue flourishes by wounding) with the royal arms of Scotland and Mary's monogram, the letters MA superimposed on the Greek letter phi. A version of this panel was sent to the Earl of Norfolk who was planning to marry Mary and supplant Queen Elizabeth.  

There are eight octagonal and 28 smaller, cross-shaped panels depicting various plants, birds, animals and fish, 18 of which bear Mary's monogram. Not all the panels were embroidered by her, as household accounts show that she had professional embroiderers as part of her retinue. The existing 'hangings' are not the original arrangement of the embroidery.  They may have originally served as cushion covers or smaller hangings; Mary frequently sent embroideries as gifts to friends and supporters, as well as Queen Elizabeth.

The embroideries were given to Ann Dacre, Countess of Arundel, daughter-in-law of the Duke of Norfolk who was executed in 1574 for his plot against Queen Elizabeth.  It is thought that the current arrangement of wall hanging, two bed curtains and valance was put together in the late 17th century by Ann Dacre's daughter-in-law, Alathea Talbot, granddaughter of Bess, Countess of Shrewsbury. The hangings made their way through descendants of the Arundels to Cowdray Park.  In 1761, the hangings came to Oxburgh Hall. They were purchased by the National Art Collections Fund in 1955. Unable to give them directly to the National Trust, the NACF donated the hangings to the V&A Museum, on condition they remain at Oxburgh.",'Silver thread'

The flat, circular base with sides gathered on a drawstring prevented spilling or revealing the contents, and the coat of arms on the bottom identified the owner.

Playing and betting on card games was a socially acceptable pastime for the wealthy in the later 17th century.  Along with dancing, riding and the theatre, it was an amusement for those classes that did not have to work. The coat of arms identify the owner of the purse as Jacques de Goyon de Matignon who was consecrated Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church in Paris in 1673.

Many were solely decorative, to display the wealth and status of their owner. They were worn in the hat or belt, as well as carried in the hand. Gloves were popular as gifts and were exchanged as a gesture of engagement or wedding present. In combat, a glove was thrown down as a gage, or challenge.

Decorative gloves were popular with England’s working class. In 1618 Horatio Busini, chaplain to the Venetian ambassador to England, wrote disapprovingly in a report on English customs:  “all wear very costly gloves.  This fashion of gloves is so universal that even the porters wear them very ostentatiously.”

The decoration of this glove is characteristic of the period 1615 to 1625 with couched embroidery in a stylised pattern and fringe of metal thread.",'Silver thread'
http://data.silknow.org/object/2038566a-c213-32da-bdc3-a633b3f7ea1d,vam,"In the 19th century gloves were an indispensable accessory for women. They were worn for day and evening wear. Wealthy women owned many pairs suited to different occasions and carefully chosen to match particular outfits. Strict rules applied to the wearing of gloves. A woman would be considered undressed if she left the house ungloved and it was customary, for instance, to keep gloves on in church, at the theatre and at balls but to remove them before dining.

These embroidered white kid gloves are typical of day gloves worn by women in the 1830s and 40s. The fashion for pale coloured soft kid leather was the subject of much discussion in etiquette manuals. It was considered extremely bad form to wear discoloured or worn gloves, leading some to claim they 'can only be worn once'. This particular pair appear to be unworn as there is no sign of the stretching required to wear such close fitting items. The glove pattern is cut with 'quirks' (a piece which fitted at the base of the thumb) and 'fourchettes' (the side panels for the fingers), and they would have been fastened by a single button at the wrist, which is missing on the right hand. There is no pointing on the backs of the hands as these were left plain in order to accommodate the floral design. This extremely fine hand embroidery is near identical on both left and right and forms a concentrated design over the back of the hand, typical of the period.

Their stylized floral patterns and less expensive materials imitate the elaborate embroidered versions carried by the aristocracy.  Many bear mottos or expressions relating to charity, friendship or luck, which suggests that they may have been used for gifts of money.  This example is inscribed 'heare et is hit or miss'.

The development of the 'drawn-glass' technique about 1490 allowed the manufacture of large numbers of small, round, coloured beads with a central hole, of the type used in this purse. The glassworks on the island of Murano near Venice were the most famous during the Renaissance, but by the early 17th century the technology had spread to glass-making centres in Amsterdam and Bavaria.  Beads were produced mainly for trade with North America and Africa, but they were also sold in Europe for use in embroidery.

The expression 'hit or miss' is first recorded in the English language in William Shakespeare's play <i>Troilus and Cressida</i> published in 1606, where it has the same meaning of random luck that it has today.  The expression may have derived from a country dance also known as 'hit and miss', recorded as early as 1626.",'Silver thread'

Princes' Kaftans from Ottoman Turkey

These three kaftans (and another in a nearby case) were worn by Ottoman princes who died when they were children. They were preserved in imperial tombs where, in accordance with Ottoman custom, they were placed over the graves of the deceased.

The kaftans may have come from the graves of the 19 younger sons of Sultan Murat III, who were executed at the succession of their half-brother, Mehmet III, in 1595. This gory practice, designed to avoid a struggle for the succession, was never repeated.

The kaftans, woven of silk and metal-wrapped thread, show that even in childhood, Ottoman princes were dressed in the same lavish style as the sultan and his courtiers. The wide range of designs of the time include a meandering vine set with tulips, which clearly influenced contemporary embroidery (see case opposite).

Diderot’s <i>Encyclopaedia</i> in 1772 described these uses succinctly in its definition of ribbon: ‘a flat, narrow and thin fabric, used to tie, edge or ornament, for garments as well as furnishings’. Ribbons were subject to changes in fashion, just as wide silks were. 

Ribbons could be bought at fairs, from travelling pedlars or from the high class retailers of major cities such as Paris (e.g. the <i>marchands merciers </i>of the Faubourg St Honoré which is still the city's luxury quarter today). These retailers stocked large quantities of ribbons of all sorts - from the simplest to the most elaborate - to sell to their customers, French ribbons being complemented by Dutch, Flemish, German and Swiss goods.",'Silver thread'

The head is partly shaved, as in the custom with small children in Japan; the hair is represented by three patches of black silk thread, one on the top of the head and two beside the ears, and by a wedge-shaped patch of black paint just above the forehead. The garment is cut to a point at the lower end, and covers the chest and the stomach; to the upper part of it is stitched a long band, which is tied in a bow behind; another band, tied in a bow in front, secures the garment at the waist. The stencilled pattern represents continuous scroll ornament, and the embroidery shows a design of peonies and chrysanthemums. To the front of the garment is stitched a fringed and pleated collar, woven in silver-gilt thread.",'Gold thread'

Many were solely decorative, to display the wealth and status of their owner. They were worn in the hat or belt, as well as carried in the hand. Gloves were popular as gifts and were exchanged as a gesture of engagement or wedding present. In combat, a glove was thrown down as a gage, or challenge.

Decorative gloves were popular with England’s working class. In 1618 Horatio Busini, chaplain to the Venetian ambassador to England, wrote disapprovingly in a report on English customs:  “all wear very costly gloves.  This fashion of gloves is so universal that even the porters wear them very ostentatiously.”

The decoration of this pair is characteristic of the period 1615 to 1625 with couched embroidery in a stylised pattern and fringe of metal thread.",'Silver thread'

They are too delicate and elaborate to serve as receptacles for money carried on one’s person on a daily basis.  Few commercial exchanges in the early 17th century required cash, and most household shopping was done by servants.  However, they were used as a form of gift-wrapping for the presents of coin that were offered as a New Year’s gifts to the monarch.  
  
These embroidered bags may also be the ‘sweet bags’ frequently listed in inventories and offered as gifts.  These held perfumed powder or dried flowers and herbs, and were perhaps applied to the nose like a pomander when necessary.
